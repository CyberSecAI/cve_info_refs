Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50776:

**CVE-2023-50776**

*   **Root Cause:** The PaaSLane Estimate Plugin stores PaaSLane authentication tokens unencrypted within job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Storage:** Authentication tokens are stored in plain text instead of being encrypted.
    *   **Lack of Input Masking:** The job configuration form does not mask the tokens, making them easily visible to users.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Attackers with `Item/Extended Read` permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the unencrypted authentication tokens, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the PaaSLane service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Access to Job Configuration:** An attacker with `Item/Extended Read` permission can view the tokens in the job's `config.xml` file through the Jenkins UI.
    *   **File System Access:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller file system can directly access and read the `config.xml` files containing the unencrypted tokens.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have either `Item/Extended Read` permission within Jenkins or direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system.
