Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation for the `hotelId` parameter in the `hotelDetails.php` resource. This parameter, received via a GET request, is directly used in an SQL query without sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly embeds user-supplied input into an SQL query, making it possible for an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-provided data before using it in a database query.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication or login.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including user information, hotel details, or any other stored information.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database, potentially corrupting the application's functionality and data integrity.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, SQL injection can be used to gain unauthorized access to the underlying operating system or server.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers might be able to cause a denial of service by injecting SQL queries that consume excessive resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through the `hotelId` parameter in the URL when making a GET request to the `hotelDetails.php` resource.
- **Malicious SQL Payload:** An attacker crafts a malicious SQL payload within the `hotelId` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials or prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious SQL payload.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
$hotelID=$_GET["hotelId"];
...
$sql = "SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE hotelID='$hotelID'";
$result = $conn->query($sql);
```
The application retrieves the `hotelId` parameter from the GET request, assigns it to the `$hotelID` variable, and then directly embeds this variable into a SQL query. Because the input is not sanitized, an attacker can inject SQL syntax by manipulating the value of the `hotelId` parameter. For example, they could use a payload like `' OR '1'='1` to retrieve all data from the `hotels` table.
