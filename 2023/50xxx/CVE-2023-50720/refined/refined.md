Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Solr-based search in XWiki indexing email addresses even when email obfuscation is enabled. This means that even if the user interface is configured to hide email addresses, the underlying search index still contained them, allowing them to be revealed through search queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Email addresses of users were exposed through the Solr search index, despite the intention to obfuscate them.
*   **Inconsistent Security Implementation:** A discrepancy existed between the user interface's email obfuscation and the indexing mechanism, which did not respect the obfuscation setting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could gain access to the email addresses of users on the XWiki platform, even when those addresses were intended to be hidden. This could be used for various malicious purposes including:

*   **Phishing attacks:** Email addresses can be used to target users with tailored phishing emails
*   **Spamming:** Collected email addresses may be used for spam campaigns.
*   **Social engineering:** Information can be used for social engineering attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the network, using XWiki's regular search interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker does not require any specific privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. Any user with access to the XWiki search interface can perform the query `objcontent:email*` to reveal email addresses.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was reported on Intigriti by ynoof
* The fix involved preventing email address properties from being indexed when obfuscation is enabled and also re-indexing affected wikis when the obfuscation setting is changed.
*  The vulnerability is classified as moderate with a CVSS score of 5.3
* The issue is tracked in XWiki's Jira under the ID XWIKI-20371.
