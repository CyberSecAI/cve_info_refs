### **[adryd325](/adryd325)** commented [Feb 7, 2023](#issue-1575120425)

| When trust\_header is configured, req.RemoteAddr is overwritten. This allows spoofing the remote address in following checks.  In the example the {remote\_host} variable is changed.  ``` geo_ip {         db_path /var/lib/GeoIP/GeoLite2-City.mmdb         trust_header X-Forwarded-For }  respond /test 200 {         body "Remote Address:{remote_host}" }  ```  This allows bypassing IP range restrictions, bypassing the trusted\_proxy directive in reverse\_proxy and any other restrictions or checks that use req.RemoteAddr. |
