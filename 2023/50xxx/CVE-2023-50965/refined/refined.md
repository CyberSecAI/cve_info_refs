Based on the provided content, this vulnerability is related to CVE-2023-50965.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `_ReadStaticFiles` function within `lib/middleware.c` of the MicroHttpServer C version.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `memcpy` function copies the URI to a `path` buffer without proper bounds checking.
- Specifically, `memcpy(path + strlen(STATIC_FILE_FOLDER), uri, strlen(uri));` copies the `uri` into `path` without ensuring that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the copied string.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Denial of service: The vulnerability can be triggered to cause a crash of the server, resulting in denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the server.
- The attack exploits the handling of static file paths by sending a long URI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network requests to the server hosting MicroHttpServer.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges on the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the C version of the MicroHttpServer.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) script using Python was used to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered when handling static files.
- The issue has been fixed by commit `2e5ff86102a973a1e3f7bedefd3bcf9bd510a9ca`.
- A patch was made to limit the length of the URI using `memcpy(path + strlen(STATIC_FILE_FOLDER), uri, strlen(path) + strlen(STATIC_FILE_FOLDER));`.
