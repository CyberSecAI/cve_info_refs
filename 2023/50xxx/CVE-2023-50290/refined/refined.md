{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Solr Metrics API publishes all unprotected environment variables available to each Apache Solr instance. The default list of hidden variables is designed for known secret Java system properties, not environment variables.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. The API exposes host environment variables, which may contain sensitive information, without proper redaction.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with 'metrics-read' permission can read environment variables, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information. These variables are host wide, not specific to the Java process. Depending on what is stored in environment variables, this could have significant impact.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a request to the Solr Metrics API, which requires the 'metrics-read' permission.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an account with the 'metrics-read' permission to access the metrics API."
