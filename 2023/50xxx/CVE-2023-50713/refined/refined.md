Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper privilege verification when creating new API tokens. Specifically, the Speckle server did not verify that the scopes granted to a new token were not in excess of the scopes held by the "requesting token" used to create it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authorization:** The system failed to ensure that a token creating another token does not grant more permissions than the parent token itself.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the lack of scope validation, an attacker with a token possessing only the "token write" scope could generate further tokens with additional, more powerful scopes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege escalation:** A malicious actor could use a token with limited "token write" scope to generate new tokens with more extensive privileges.
*   **Data Access:** These escalated privileges would allow the malicious actor to perform actions they are not normally authorized for.
*   **Account takeover:** Potentially, though not explicitly stated, this could lead to further compromise of user accounts by creating powerful tokens for malicious usage.
*   **Integrity compromise**: A malicious actor could modify data with the new privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed over the network, likely through the Speckle API.
*   **API Token Creation:** The vulnerability is exploited through the API token creation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Existing API Token with 'token write' scope:** An attacker must possess a valid API token that has the `token:write` scope.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the API and know how to generate new tokens.
*   **User interaction**: The user has to authorize an application with `token write` scope.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:**  Speckle server versions prior to 2.17.6 are vulnerable.
*  **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.17.6 and later.
*  **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as moderate with a CVSS score of 6.5.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix includes preventing the creation of Personal Access Tokens (PATs) with the `tokens:write` scope and adding proper scope validation during token creation.
*   **Workarounds:** No workarounds exist, and upgrading is recommended.
*   The fix introduces a new error `TokenCreateError` to handle cases where a token tries to grant higher privileges than it has itself.
*   The fix introduces the `canCreatePAT` function, which checks if a Personal Access Token creation includes the tokens:write scope, and throws an error if it does.
*   The code changes also refactor the way scopes are handled in the frontend for the `CreateEditApplicationDialog.vue` and `CreateTokenDialog.vue` components.
