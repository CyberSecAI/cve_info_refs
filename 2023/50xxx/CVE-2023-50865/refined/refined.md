Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-50865

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `hotelSearch.php` resource. Specifically, the `city` parameter received via a GET request is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This occurs because user-supplied data (`city` parameter) is incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker may be able to modify or delete existing data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** In some cases, a malicious SQL query could lead to a denial-of-service condition by causing excessive resource consumption on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `hotelSearch.php` resource.
- **Malicious `city` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `city` parameter of the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special access to the web application. They can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the internet.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `city` parameter in `hotelSearch.php` is vulnerable.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
$city=$_GET["city"];
...
$sql = "SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE city='$city'";
$rowcount = mysqli_num_rows(mysqli_query($conn,$sql));
```
- As indicated by the code, the value of `$city` which is directly taken from user input (`$_GET["city"]`) is placed directly into the SQL query. Without sanitization, SQL injection is possible.
- The `mysqli_num_rows` function is used to determine the number of rows resulting from the query, but this does not prevent the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates that this vulnerability is part of a larger set of SQL Injection vulnerabilities affecting the "Travel Website v1.0" application.
- There are no patches available for this vulnerability at the time of this writing.
