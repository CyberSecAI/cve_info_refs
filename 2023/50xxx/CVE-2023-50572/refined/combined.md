| The method `GroovyEngine.execute(...)` is used by JLine groovy REPL demo application to evaluate groovy/java statements. In underneath the method uses `groovy.lang.GroovyShell.evaluate(...)`  method which will throw OOM exception when passing the statement above as a parameter, see the output when it is executed on Groovy shell: [groovy-shell-oom](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/6079480/297666661-b899e315-ac24-4643-9001-3971a15fef20.JPG?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzY4ODQ0NTYsIm5iZiI6MTczNjg4NDE1NiwicGF0aCI6Ii82MDc5NDgwLzI5NzY2NjY2MS1iODk5ZTMxNS1hYzI0LTQ2NDMtOTAwMS0zOTcxYTE1ZmVmMjAuSlBHP1gtQW16LUFsZ29yaXRobT1BV1M0LUhNQUMtU0hBMjU2JlgtQW16LUNyZWRlbnRpYWw9QUtJQVZDT0RZTFNBNTNQUUs0WkElMkYyMDI1MDExNCUyRnVzLWVhc3QtMSUyRnMzJTJGYXdzNF9yZXF1ZXN0JlgtQW16LURhdGU9MjAyNTAxMTRUMTk0OTE2WiZYLUFtei1FeHBpcmVzPTMwMCZYLUFtei1TaWduYXR1cmU9ZmI5YzM4NmI2MTEzMTE4NGU4OWZiOWYxNDAxMGViYjVjZWI4ZDgzYjYwMTAwMTY2NGEyZDM0MTExYmY4NjZkMCZYLUFtei1TaWduZWRIZWFkZXJzPWhvc3QifQ.bR8U2DCiWDaJ2XVBXqOqDXPmfuHD_YcbbYnKscGc1mc)  I have not seen the `executeFuzzerTest()` enter into infinite loop but as you can enter an arbitrary groovy/java statement to the `GroovyEngine.execute(...)` method you can easily create also infinite loop `groovyEngine.execute("while (true) {}")`.  When I tried to `executeFuzzerTest()` on groovy REPL demo application I found an other OOM exception when trying to display the execution result that is fixed on commit [f3c60a3](https://github.com/jline/jline3/commit/f3c60a3e6255e8e0c20d5043a4fe248446f292bb) .  The method `GroovyEngine.execute(...)` works as designed. |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
