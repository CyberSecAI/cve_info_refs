- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization in the `DoExecSql` function, where POST request content is directly passed to the `DoRunQuery` function for SQL execution without filtering. This allows execution of arbitrary SQL statements.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **SQL Injection**: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the POST request parameters.
    - **Arbitrary File Upload**:  Specifically, the use of `select ... into dumpfile` allows for arbitrary file uploads to the server when the `secure_file_priv` MySQL variable is not set to a restrictive value.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: By uploading a PHP file (or similar) containing malicious code, an attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server by accessing the uploaded file. This leads to complete compromise of the affected system.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - **HTTP POST Requests**: The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP POST requests to the application backend. 
    - **SQL Injection Payload**: The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query within the POST request that utilizes the `select into dumpfile` command to write an arbitrary file.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **Access to the application's backend**: The attacker needs to have access to the administrative interface where the vulnerable SQL query execution takes place.
    - **Knowledge of SQL**: The attacker needs to be aware of the SQL syntax and functionality, especially the `select into dumpfile` command.
    - **`secure_file_priv` misconfiguration**:  The attacker relies on the fact that the `secure_file_priv` MySQL variable is either not set, or set to a permissive value.

**Additional Notes**:

- The provided content offers more details than a standard CVE description by showing the specific vulnerable code locations, SQL injection payload, exploitation steps, and prerequisites.
- The vulnerability is present in EmpireCMS version 7.5.
- A mitigation measure is to restrict MySQL's `secure_file_priv` variable to prevent arbitrary file uploads.
