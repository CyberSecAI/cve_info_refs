# Out of memory error when submitting the dataset form with a specially-crafted field

Moderate

[amercader](/amercader)
published
GHSA-7fgc-89cx-w8j5
Dec 13, 2023

## Package

pip

ckan
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

> 2.0

## Patched versions

2.9.10, 2.10.3

## Description

### Impact

When submitting a POST request to the `/dataset/new` endpoint (including either the auth cookie or the `Authorization` header) with a specially-crafted field, an attacker can create an out-of-memory error in the hosting server.

To trigger this error the user needs to have permissions to create or edit datasets.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in CKAN 2.10.3 and 2.9.10

### Severity

Moderate

4.5

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-50248
