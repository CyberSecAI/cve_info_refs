#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

As an admin user, open <xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/view/%22%3E%7B%7B%2Fhtml%7D%7D%7B%7Basync%20context%3D%22request/parameters%22%7D%7D%7B%7Bvelocity%7D%7D%23evaluate(%24request/eval)/?sheet=XWiki.ConfigurableClass&xpage=view&eval=$services.logging.getLogger(%22attacker%22).error(%22Attack%20success%20$hasProgramming%22) where <xwiki-host> is the URL of your XWiki installation.

Alternatively, as a user with edit right, first create a configurable section as, e.g., explained on [~~XWIKI-21121~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21121 "Remote code execution/programming rights through heading of configuration sections with edit rights").

**Expected result:**

The code in the URL is not executed.

**Actual result:**

A message like

```
2023-07-25 17:24:07,226 [org.xwiki.rendering.async.internal.AsyncRendererJob@778eca14([async, macro, xwiki:XWiki.ConfigurableClass, 8, author, xwiki:XWiki.Admin, rendering.restricted, false, request.parameters, {xpage=[Ljava.lang.String;@6d34dae1, sheet=[Ljava.lang.String;@7a1c53cf, eval=[Ljava.lang.String;@43bfe9cb}, secureDocument, xwiki:XWiki.ConfigurableClass, 459])] ERROR attacker                       - Attack success true

```

is logged, showing that that code has been executed with programming right.

For this attack to succeed, the user needs to have edit right on at least one configurable section so this is not a remote code execution attack from guest. However, it is possible to trick an admin into visiting the URL to trigger the attack, e.g., by embedding the URL as an image in a comment.

Also, via the same attack vector, XSS is possible, too.

It seems that the vulnerable code has been introduced in [~~XAADMINISTRATION-112~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XAADMINISTRATION-112 "Allow applications to bring configuration forms into the administration app without modifying it.") which seems to have been released in XWiki 2.3, see <https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise23#HEasierdevelopmentofconfigurableapplicationsusingXWiki.ConfigurableClass>

# XSS/CSRF Remote Code Execution in XWiki.ConfigurableClass

Critical

[michitux](/michitux)
published
GHSA-cp3j-273x-3jxc
Dec 15, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-administration-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 2.3, < 14.10.15
>= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.5.1
>= 15.6-rc-1, < 15.7-rc-1

## Patched versions

14.10.15
15.5.2
15.7-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

There is a reflected XSS or also direct remote code execution vulnerability in the code for displaying configurable admin sections. The code that can be passed through a URL parameter is only executed when the user who is visiting the crafted URL has edit right on at least one configuration section. While any user of the wiki could easily create such a section, in this case it is much more convenient to exploit [GHSA-qj86-p74r-7wp5](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-qj86-p74r-7wp5) which is why this attack scenario won't be further considered in the following. In contrast to [GHSA-qj86-p74r-7wp5](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qj86-p74r-7wp5 "GHSA-qj86-p74r-7wp5"), this vulnerability doesn't require the attacker to have an account or any access on the wiki. It is sufficient to trick any admin user of the XWiki installation to visit the crafted URL. Alternatively, the URL can also be embedded as image source of an image in any content of the wiki like a comment that could be left by an anonymous user. This vulnerability allows full remote code execution with programming rights and thus impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation.

### Patches

This has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.2 and 15.7RC1

### Workarounds

The [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/5e14c8d08fd0c5b619833d35090b470aa4cb52b0#diff-bf419a99140f3c12fd78ea30f855b63cfb74c1c976ff4436898266d9b37ad3ce) can be manually applied to the document `XWiki.ConfigurableClass`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
