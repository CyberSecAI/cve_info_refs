Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of the `space` parameter in the `XWiki.ConfigurableClass` document. This allows for the injection of malicious code through a crafted URL. The vulnerable code was introduced in a previous change (XAADMINISTRATION-112) aimed at allowing applications to bring configuration forms into the administration app.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By injecting code into the `eval` parameter of the URL, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with programming rights on the XWiki server. The vulnerability is triggered when the `XWiki.ConfigurableClass` document is viewed with a crafted URL.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The same attack vector can be used to inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **CSRF:** It is possible to trick an administrator into visiting the malicious URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can gain full control of the XWiki installation.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The attacker can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the entire XWiki installation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URL:** An attacker can create a malicious URL with injected code in the `eval` parameter and trick a user with edit rights (admin or other) into visiting it.
*   **Embedded URL:** The malicious URL can be embedded as an image source within comments or other content on the wiki.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need an account or any special access to the wiki.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user with edit rights on at least one configurable section to visit a crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the `XWiki.ConfigurableClass` document is viewed with the crafted URL.
*   The vulnerability was introduced in XWiki 2.3.
*   The issue has been fixed in XWiki versions 14.10.15, 15.5.2, and 15.7-rc-1.
*   A patch is available and can be applied manually by modifying the `XWiki.ConfigurableClass` document.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 9.7 (Critical)
*   **Attack Vector:** Network (AV:N)
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low (AC:L)
*   **Privileges Required:** None (PR:N)
*   **User Interaction:** Required (UI:R)
*   **Scope:** Changed (S:C)
*   **Confidentiality:** High (C:H)
*   **Integrity:** High (I:H)
*   **Availability:** High (A:H)

**CWE:**
* CWE-79
