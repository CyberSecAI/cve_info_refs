- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An unprivileged user can perform actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges. The specific impact will vary depending on the function that is vulnerable.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, suggesting a direct attack vector likely through HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any specific privileges or authentication to exploit the vulnerability. They can exploit it remotely if the vulnerable endpoint is publicly accessible.
