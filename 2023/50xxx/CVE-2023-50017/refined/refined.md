The provided content details a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Dreamer CMS version 4.1.3, specifically within the `/admin/database/backup` component.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection on the backup functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
*   **CSRF:** The backup functionality is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated user, will trigger a backup operation without the user's knowledge or consent.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can trigger unauthorized database backups. This could lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration (attacker gains access to the backup file)
    *   Denial of service (legitimate backups are overwritten by the attacker's backups)
    *   Potential for further compromise via manipulation of the backup data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a malicious web page controlled by the attacker.
*   An attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when a logged-in user visits, triggers a backup request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs the victim to be logged into the Dreamer CMS.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick the user into visiting a malicious website or page under their control.
