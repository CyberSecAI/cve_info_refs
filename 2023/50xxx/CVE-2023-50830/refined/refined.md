- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Seos Contact Form plugin for WordPress, versions 1.8.0 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website. These scripts will be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's contact form, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to submit data through the contact form. An administrator privilege is noted, but it's not clear if that's required for exploitation, or for post-exploitation.
