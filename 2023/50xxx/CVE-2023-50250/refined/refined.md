Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50250:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the uploaded XML template filename within the `templates_import.php` file. Specifically, when an invalid XML file is uploaded, the filename is directly included in a JavaScript alert message without proper encoding, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS in the `templates_import.php` file.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize the filename of the uploaded XML file before including it in a JavaScript alert, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Execution of arbitrary JavaScript:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser by uploading a specially crafted XML filename.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The injected JavaScript can be used to steal session cookies or tokens.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker can perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user, potentially leading to unauthorized changes within the Cacti application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via the web interface of the Cacti application.
*   **File Upload:** The attack is triggered by uploading a malicious XML template file to the `templates_import.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Cacti Web Interface:** The attacker needs to have access to the Cacti web interface.
*   **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker must be able to access the template import functionality which allows uploading XML files
*   **No Specific Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require any specific privileges, a valid user is enough to trigger the vulnerability

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `templates_import.php`.
*   The `raise_message_javascript()` function is used to display an error message, which includes the unsanitized filename.
*   The filename is included in the JavaScript code within a single-quoted string, enabling XSS injection.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found in Cacti version 1.2.25 and fixed in 1.2.26.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
*   The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3 base score is 5.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L).
