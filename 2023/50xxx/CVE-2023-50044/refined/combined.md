This code checks whether input is built-in APIs or not. Furthermore, it detects a bug which leads unexpected memory access,

Sorry, something went wrong.

SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV /mjs/mjs.c:8472:31 in getprop_builtin_foreign  ==203500==ABORTING   ``` Conclusion The bug was triggered due to an attempt to access memory locations that are restricted when the input string contains Built-in APIs. This report specifically provides information when the input string contained the substring "die" (input string: "die[8888888888]"). The presence of "die[88888888]" within the input string led to a segment fault, as it incorrectly identified an inaccessible address of the Built-in APIs as an accessible foreign pointer. Upon further testing with other Built-in APIs, it was discovered that the issue applied to all of the Built-in APIs mentioned in the README.md documentation.  I will submit a Pull Request to address this issue. |
