Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50917:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `transport` parameter, within the `thumb.php` script of MajorDoMo. This allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsanitized Input:** The `transport` parameter is directly incorporated into a system command without any sanitization or validation.
*   **Command Injection:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system command constructed using `exec`.
*   **Base64 Decoding:** The script decodes the base64 encoded `url` parameter, and this is used to bypass rudimentary checks

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server running MajorDoMo.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Attackers can gain full control of the MajorDoMo instance, leading to potential compromise of connected devices, security systems and surveillance cameras.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET parameter:** The `thumb.php` script takes a base64 encoded `url` and a `transport` parameter via HTTP GET requests, both vulnerable to manipulation.
*   **Command Injection:** By crafting a malicious `transport` parameter, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary system commands.
*   **Base64 Obfuscation:** The initial `url` parameter is base64 encoded and is used to bypass rudimentary checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the MajorDoMo instance to send HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `thumb.php` script and the ability to inject commands via the `transport` parameter.
*   **Basic HTTP/URL manipulation:** The attacker must be able to craft the required malicious parameters (`url`, `transport`) in a http GET request.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `thumb.php` module.
*   The vulnerable code constructs an `ffmpeg` command using user-supplied input.
*   The `transport` parameter is used directly in the command.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on October 28, 2023 and patched on November 14, 2023.
*   The `url` parameter can be base64 encoded to bypass basic checks.
