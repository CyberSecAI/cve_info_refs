- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A session fixation vulnerability exists in FortiOS when using SAML authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session fixation (CWE-384) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can hijack a user's session by tricking the user into using a malicious SAML authentication link. Successful exploitation would allow the attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a phishing link containing a malicious SAML authentication request to a user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious link to a victim and must have the target user click on the crafted link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated before the attack.
