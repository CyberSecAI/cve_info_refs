- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `HsAccessoriesGroupProductAbstract::getAccessoriesByIdProducts()` method in the "Multi Accessories Pro" module for PrestaShop has a vulnerable SQL call. This call is susceptible to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of input parameters. Specifically, the `id_products` and `id_groups` variables, used in SQL IN clauses, are not properly sanitized before being included in SQL queries.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89). The module fails to sanitize input parameters before using them in SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can:
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop.
    - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to the front end, potentially exposing tokens and unlocking admin ajax scripts.
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
    - Gain full control of the database.
    - Impact confidentiality, integrity and availability of the application.

- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack via a standard HTTP call to a PrestaShop front controller. The specific module controller path can be concealed during exploitation, making it difficult to detect in standard web server logs.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges or user interaction is required. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request to the affected PrestaShop instance.
