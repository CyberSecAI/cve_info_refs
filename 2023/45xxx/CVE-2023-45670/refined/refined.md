{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `/config/save` and `/config/set` endpoints lack CSRF protection, allowing modification of the Frigate server's configuration through cross-site requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can arbitrarily update the Frigate server's configuration, leading to denial of service and potential data exfiltration.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious webpage with embedded code that sends unauthorized requests to the Frigate server. This page is then used in a 'drive-by' attack, where an authenticated user is tricked into visiting the page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must know the target Frigate server's address, craft a malicious webpage, and trick an authenticated user into visiting that page."
