Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-45120:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation for the `qid` parameter in the `/update.php?q=quiz&step=2` resource. The application directly uses this parameter in an SQL query without any sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection (SQLi) due to the unsanitized `qid` parameter being used in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database by manipulating the SQL query.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker could alter or delete data in the database.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker might be able to use SQL injection to cause a denial of service by making queries that overload the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP GET request to the `/update.php?q=quiz&step=2` endpoint.
- **URL Parameter:** The `qid` parameter is the attack vector, where malicious SQL code is inserted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Online Examination System to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
$qid=@$_GET['qid'];
$q=mysqli_query($con,"SELECT * FROM answer WHERE qid='$qid' " );
```

This code retrieves the `qid` parameter from the GET request and directly inserts it into a SQL query without proper sanitization.
