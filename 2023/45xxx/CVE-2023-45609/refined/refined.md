- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Powr Pack WordPress plugin versions 2.1.0 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website. This injected code is executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through user input fields that are not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the vulnerable input fields, which would require some level of user privileges (at least Contributor level as specified in the details).
