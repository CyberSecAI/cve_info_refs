Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2023-45499:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an HTTP API exposed by VinChin Backup that can be accessed using hard-coded credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the use of hard-coded credentials to access the API.
*   **Bypass of ACLs:** The hardcoded credentials bypass Access Control Lists (ACLs), granting higher privileges than intended for this authentication method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Control over Backup System:** Exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to perform a wide range of actions, such as:
    *   View, edit, add, or delete storage.
    *   View or delete backups.
    *   View, edit, add, or delete jobs.
    *   View, edit, add, or delete cloud accounts.
    *   View, edit, add, or delete hypervisors.
    *   View, edit, add, or delete users.
    *   Query system information, licensing, and service status.
*   **Data Breach and System Compromise:** An attacker with control over the backup system could potentially gain access to sensitive data, compromise other systems by manipulating backups, and disrupt the backup process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any attacker who has network access to the vulnerable VinChin Backup server.
*   **HTTP API:** The attack vector is through the exposed HTTP API of the VinChin Backup application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access to VinChin Backup Server:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the VinChin Backup server.
*   **No prior authentication required**: The attacker leverages the hardcoded credentials to gain access to the API.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the API endpoints to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**

*   VinChin VMWare Backup versions 5.0 to 7.0 are affected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor, VinChin, was unresponsive to vulnerability reports, leading to public disclosure.
*   The fix implemented in version 7.2 limits the number of API methods accessible with the hardcoded credentials but doesn't eliminate them. Access Control Lists have been updated to prevent CVE-2023-45498 (RCE) from being reached with the hardcoded credentials.
* The vendor released version 7.2 on 2023-11-02 that addresses the issue.
