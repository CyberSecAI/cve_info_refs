Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the markdown file:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `sub_49E098` function of the Tenda AC10 router firmware. The function processes data from the `list` parameter, which is received from the `fromSetIpMacBind` function. The `sscanf` function is used to parse this data without any length checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The primary weakness is the lack of bounds checking when parsing the `list` parameter using `sscanf`. The `sscanf` function writes the parsed data into fixed-size stack-based buffers: `mac_addr` and `ip_addr`. A sufficiently long crafted input can overflow these buffers, overwriting adjacent memory on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a crash of the service, leading to a denial of service. The router would likely become unresponsive or unstable, requiring a restart.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The document also notes the possibility of remote code execution. By carefully crafting the overflow, an attacker could potentially overwrite the return address or other crucial data on the stack, redirecting program execution to malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetIpMacBind` endpoint.
- **`list` Parameter:** The malicious input is delivered via the `list` parameter within the POST request's data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Tenda router's web interface, typically within the same local network.
- **Ability to Forge HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be capable of creating and sending HTTP POST requests.

**Technical Details from the content:**
- The vulnerability exists in Tenda AC10 router version V4.0 V16.03.10.13.
- The vulnerable function is `sub_49E098`.
- The `list` parameter's format is expected to be `deviceName1\r10:11:11:11:11:11\r<ip_addr>`.
- The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code demonstrates sending a request with a long `ipaddr` value within the list parameter to cause the overflow.
