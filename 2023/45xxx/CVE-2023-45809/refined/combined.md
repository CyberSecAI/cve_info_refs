# Disclosure of user names via admin bulk action views

Low

[gasman](/gasman)
published
GHSA-fc75-58r8-rm3h
Oct 19, 2023

## Package

pip

wagtail
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<4.1.9, 4.2-5.0.4, 5.1-5.1.2

## Patched versions

4.1.9, 5.0.5, 5.1.3, 5.2rc1

## Description

### Impact

A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin can make a direct URL request to the admin view that handles bulk actions on user accounts. While authentication rules prevent the user from making any changes, the error message discloses the display names of user accounts, and by modifying URL parameters, the user can retrieve the display name for any user. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.

### Patches

Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.9 (LTS), 5.0.5 and 5.1.3. The fix is also included in Release Candidate 1 of the forthcoming Wagtail 5.2 release.

### Workarounds

None.

### Acknowledgements

Many thanks to [@quyenheu](https://github.com/quyenheu) for reporting this issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
