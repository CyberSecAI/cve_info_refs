Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45118:

**CVE Description:**

The 'fdid' parameter of the `/update.php` resource in Online Examination System v1.0 does not validate user input, leading to an Authenticated SQL Injection vulnerability.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization and validation of the `fdid` parameter passed to the `/update.php` resource before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates the unsanitized `fdid` parameter into a SQL DELETE statement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to delete arbitrary records from the `feedback` table by injecting malicious SQL code through the `fdid` parameter.
-   **Data Loss:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to delete any feedback records, potentially causing data loss.
-   **Potential for Further Attacks:** SQL Injection vulnerabilities can often be chained with other attacks, potentially leading to more severe compromises such as privilege escalation, data exfiltration and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a GET request to the `/update.php` resource by manipulating the `fdid` parameter.
-   **Network:** The attack vector is remote and accessible over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
-   **Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge about the application's parameters, specifically the `fdid` parameter.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the application.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is as follows:

```php
$id=@$_GET['fdid'];
$result = mysqli_query($con,"DELETE FROM feedback WHERE id='$id' ") or die('Error');
```
This code directly takes the value of the `fdid` GET parameter and embeds it into the SQL DELETE query without any sanitization or validation, making it vulnerable to SQL Injection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that the vulnerability has been assigned the CVSSv3 base score of 8.8 which is considered HIGH.
