Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45341:

**Verification:**

The provided content from fluidattacks.com directly references CVE-2023-45341, and the description aligns with the provided vulnerability details.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation for the '\*_price' parameter within the `routers/menu-router.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.
*   **Weakness:** The core weakness is the failure to sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the code uses a regular expression to check if the key ends with `_price`, but does not validate the numerical `value` before directly embedding it into the query.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could potentially inject queries that cause the database server to crash or become unavailable.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated. An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint containing the malicious SQL injection payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
if(preg_match("/[0-9]+_price/",$key)){
 $key = strtok($key, '_');
 $sql = "UPDATE items SET price = $value WHERE id = $key;";
 $con->query($sql);
}
```

The `preg_match` function checks if the `$key` matches the pattern `/[0-9]+_price/`. If it matches, `strtok` extracts the numerical ID part of the `$key`. However, the `$value` taken from the post parameter directly without any sanitization. This makes the system vulnerable to SQL injection where a malicious user can inject SQL commands by modifying the `value` parameter.

**Summary**

The `Online Food Ordering System v1.0` has an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability. By sending a specially crafted `*_price` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code. The vulnerability allows for remote, unauthenticated exploitation with high severity (CVSS score 9.8).
