- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly validate user privileges before allowing certain actions to be performed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact will vary depending on the affected function.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to be a subscriber of the WordPress site. Then the attacker exploits the lack of access control in the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a subscriber level account on the WordPress site.
