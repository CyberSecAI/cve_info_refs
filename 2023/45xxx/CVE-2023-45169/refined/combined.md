# High Impact / Highly Pervasive APARs IJ44513/IJ44047

### Notification

## Risk classification

HIPER (High Impact and/or Pervasive)

## Risk categories

System Outage

## Abstract

Possible system crashes processing network traffic
**UPDATE**: The table of ifixes has been updated to include the conflicting kernel and TCP/IP kernel extension security vulnerability fixes from: <https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6847947>

## Description

IBM has seen multiple issues processing normal network traffic on recent code levels (affected levels listed below).

* System crashes when routes expire due to dynamic routing
* Memory leaks or crashes when the cached\_routes feature is enabled on AIX. (# no -o cached\_routes)
* System crashes due to synchronization issues between threads referencing the route entry in TCP/IP code

# Security Bulletin: AIX is vulnerable to denial of service vulnerabilities

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

UPDATED: (Additional iFixes are now available for AIX 7.2 TL5 SP5, 7.3 TL0 SP2, 7.3 TL0 SP3, 7.3 TL1 SP1, and VIOS 3.1.3.21, 3.1.3.30, and 3.1.4.10. Both the original and new iFixes address the kernel security vulnerabilities mentioned in the bulletin, but the new iFixes also address the previously released HIPER bulletin: https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6857545) Vulnerabilities in the AIX kernel and kernel extensions could allow a non-privileged local user to cause a denial of service (CVE-2023-45175, CVE-2023-45173, CVE-2023-45169, CVE-2023-45171).

By subscribing, you will receive periodic email alerting you to the status of the APAR, and a link to download the fix once it becomes available.

**B. FIXES**

IBM strongly recommends addressing the vulnerability now.

AIX and VIOS fixes are available.

An LPAR system reboot is required to complete the iFix installation, or Live Update may be used on AIX 7.2 and 7.3 to avoid a reboot.

The AIX and VIOS fixes can be downloaded via https from:

<https://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/kernel_fix6.tar>

The link above is to a tar file containing this signed advisory, fix packages, and OpenSSL signatures for each package. The fixes below include prerequisite checking. This will enforce the correct mapping between the fixes and AIX Technology Levels.

These sums should match exactly. The OpenSSL signatures in the tar file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the integrity of the fixes. If the sums or signatures cannot be confirmed, contact IBM Support at <http://ibm.com/support/> and describe the discrepancy.

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [advisory\_file].sig [advisory\_file]

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [ifix\_file].sig [ifix\_file]

**C. FIX AND INTERIM FIX INSTALLATION**

An LPAR system reboot is required to complete the iFix installation, or Live Update may be used on AIX 7.2 and 7.3 to avoid a reboot.

If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup of the system be created. Verify it is both bootable and readable before proceeding.

To preview a fix installation:

installp -a -d fix\_name -p all  # where fix\_name is the name of the

# fix package being previewed.

To install a fix package:

installp -a -d fix\_name -X all  # where fix\_name is the name of the

# fix package being installed.

Interim fixes have had limited functional and regression testing but not the full regression testing that takes place for Service Packs; however, IBM does fully support them.

Interim fix management documentation can be found at:

<https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/managing-interim-fixes-aix>

To preview an interim fix installation:

emgr -e ipkg\_name -p         # where ipkg\_name is the name of the

# interim fix package being previewed.

To install an interim fix package:

emgr -e ipkg\_name -X         # where ipkg\_name is the name of the

# interim fix package being installed.

## Change History

09 Jan 2024: Additional iFixes are now available for AIX 7.2 TL5 SP5, 7.3 TL0 SP2, 7.3 TL0 SP3, 7.3 TL1 SP1, and VIOS 3.1.3.21, 3.1.3.30, and 3.1.4.10. Both the original and new iFixes address the kernel security vulnerabilities mentioned in the bulletin, but the new iFixes also address the previously released HIPER bulletin: https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6857545

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
