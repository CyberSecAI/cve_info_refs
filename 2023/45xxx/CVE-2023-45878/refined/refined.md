{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `rubrics_visualise_saveAjax.php` file in the Rubrics module allows unauthenticated users to write arbitrary files to the server by controlling the `img` and `path` POST parameters. The application takes a base64 encoded string from the 'img' parameter and writes it to the path specified in 'path' parameter without sanitization or validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type. Arbitrary file write due to lack of validation and sanitization of file paths and content provided via HTTP POST parameters.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload malicious files, such as PHP files, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `rubrics_visualise_saveAjax.php` file with base64-encoded malicious code in the `img` parameter and a desired file path in the `path` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No prior authentication or specific network position is required."
