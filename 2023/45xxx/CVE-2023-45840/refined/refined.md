Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2023-45840.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `riscv64-elf-toolchain` package in Buildroot fetches its sources from an `https` URL but lacks a `.hash` file for integrity verification. This allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to downgrade the connection to `http` (due to the default `BR2_BACKUP_SITE` being an `http` URL) and supply a malicious source package.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing hash file for the `riscv64-elf-toolchain` package.
- Downgrade from https to http possible due to the default `BR2_BACKUP_SITE` setting, which is an `http` URL.
- Lack of integrity check on downloaded source code for the affected package.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution on the builder machine.
- Tampering with files generated for Buildroot's targets and hosts.
- Insertion of malicious code into the build process via compromised source packages, Makefiles or patch files.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the network where the build process is occurring.
- Dropping HTTPS requests to the primary site, forcing Buildroot to use the fallback `http://sources.buildroot.net` URL.
- Serving a compromised source package when Buildroot requests the file via the fallback `http` connection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to perform a MITM attack on the network.
- Ability to intercept and modify network traffic.
- Ability to host a malicious source package on an `http` server.
