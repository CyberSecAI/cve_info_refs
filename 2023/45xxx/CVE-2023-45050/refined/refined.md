Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2023-45050:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper output escaping and sanitization of user-supplied attributes within custom Gutenberg blocks in the Jetpack plugin. These attributes are directly incorporated into HTML tags without sufficient validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Authenticated Stored XSS:** A user with Contributor role or higher can inject arbitrary JavaScript code through vulnerable block attributes.
- **Specific Vulnerable Locations:**
    - `wp:jetpack/button` block:
        - The "text" attribute is not properly sanitized, allowing for injection via double quotes.
        - The "element" attribute allows for the injection of `<script>` tags with a custom `src`.
    - `wp:jetpack/recurring-payments` block:
        -  The `submitButtonAttributes` are not correctly sanitized and allows for arbitrary attribute injection into the `<a>` tag.
    - `wp:jetpack/story` block:
        - The `media['id']` is directly concatenated into the `class` attribute of the `video` tag without sanitization.
    - `wp:videopress/video` block:
        - The `anchor` attribute is directly injected into the `id` attribute of the figure tag.
        - The `posterData['url']` attribute is used to construct inline styles without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the website. This can lead to:
    -   Stealing of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens)
    -   Privilege escalation within the WordPress site
    -   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    -   Displaying unwanted content or advertisements
    -   Other malicious activities by executing JavaScript on the victim's browser

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack vector is through the WordPress editor, where a user with a minimum role of Contributor can create or modify content using the affected Gutenberg blocks and inject malicious code via the aforementioned vulnerable attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site with at least the Contributor role. This is because they need the ability to create/edit posts/pages using the Gutenberg editor.

**Additional Details:**
-   The vulnerability was present in Jetpack plugin versions <= 12.8-a.1 and fixed in version 12.8-a.3.
-   The vulnerability is classified as a low priority with a CVSS score of 6.5

The patch involves implementing proper output escaping using `esc_attr`, `esc_html`, `sanitize_key`, and a whitelist of allowed HTML tags.
