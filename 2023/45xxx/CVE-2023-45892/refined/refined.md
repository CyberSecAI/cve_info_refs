Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of access controls for accessing invoice and order pages in the "Insights by Floorsight" product. This allows unauthenticated users to directly access these resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application uses predictable IDs in URLs to access resources (invoices and orders) without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** A remote attacker can access sensitive information such as invoices and order details without needing to authenticate.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** An attacker can access the vulnerable pages by crafting URLs with sequential or guessed IDs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web application over the network.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require the attacker to have any user credentials.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable endpoints are:
    - `https://insight.victim.com/invoice.aspx?id=1`
    - `https://insight.victim.com/order.aspx?id=1`
- The vulnerable versions are Q3 2023 and below (no specific version numbers).
