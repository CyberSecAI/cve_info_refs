    "content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2023-45142. The vulnerability is present in the `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp` library. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe `otelhttp` library, when used to instrument HTTP servers, by default includes high-cardinality attributes in its metrics, specifically `http.user_agent` and `http.method`. These attributes are derived directly from the incoming HTTP request headers.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\nThe core issue lies in the unbounded nature of the `http.user_agent` and `http.method` attributes. The library uses `httpconv.ServerRequest` function that records every value for these attributes. This means that for every unique user agent string or method sent, a new metric series is created, leading to an uncontrolled increase in the number of metric series recorded which causes a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality and potential memory exhaustion.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\nAn attacker can send a large number of HTTP requests with random or unique `User-Agent` strings and HTTP methods. This will cause the instrumented server to allocate an unbounded amount of memory to store these metrics, potentially leading to:\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The server may crash due to memory exhaustion, becoming unavailable to legitimate users.\n*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The excessive memory usage can impact overall system performance, leading to instability.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   The attack vector is **network-based**. An attacker can exploit this remotely by sending malicious HTTP requests over the network.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction. They can be any client able to send HTTP requests to the server that uses the vulnerable library.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to generate and send HTTP requests. They do not need any prior access or credentials.\n\n**Additional details from the content:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is addressed in `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp` version 0.44.0 (and `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/github.com/astaxie/beego/otelbeego` v0.39.0) by restricting the `http.request.method` values to a known set of HTTP methods, or `_OTHER`, and removing the high cardinality attributes mentioned above. \n*   Prior to the fix, the issue was exacerbated when using the `cumulative` temporality for the metrics, as the metric instruments do not \"forget\" previous measurement attributes when `cumulative` temporality is used\n*   A workaround for the affected versions is using `otelhttp.WithFilter()` but it requires manual configuration and care to not log certain requests entirely.\n*   The vulnerability is similar to GHSA-5r5m-65gx-7vrh and GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p.\n"
