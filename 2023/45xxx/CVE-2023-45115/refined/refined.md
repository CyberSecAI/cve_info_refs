Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query. Specifically, the 'ch' parameter within the `/update.php?q=addqns` resource is directly inserted into an SQL INSERT statement without any form of validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The lack of input validation on the 'ch' parameter allows for SQL injection. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Database Compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data in the database, potentially leading to complete compromise.
- **Data Breach:** Sensitive information stored in the database, such as user credentials or personal details, could be exposed.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker could modify data or the database structure to cause application malfunction or data corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to the `/update.php` resource with the `q=addqns` and a malicious payload injected into the `ch` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Online Examination System.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the application.
