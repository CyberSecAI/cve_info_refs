Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-45498:

**Root Cause:**
*   Improper input sanitization in a specific API endpoint of VinChin Backup software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A specially crafted payload sent to the vulnerable API endpoint allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The software fails to properly validate or sanitize input, which is the direct cause of the vulnerability.
*   **Bypassed ACLs:** The vulnerability could be reached due to hardcoded credentials bypassing ACLs.
    *   Although the fix mentioned limits API access via hardcoded credentials, the RCE vulnerability itself was still present in the code.
*   **HTTP API Exposure:** The vulnerability exists within an exposed HTTP API of the VinChin Backup application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute code with the privileges of the web server, potentially leading to full system compromise and control.
*   **Data Breach:**  Since the software manages backups of critical infrastructure, exploitation could result in data breaches, exfiltration of sensitive information, and potential manipulation of backups.
*   **Access to critical infrastructure:** The backup software holds credentials to critical points of the network, such as servers, hypervisors, storage, and cloud accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP API Endpoint:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specific endpoint within the exposed HTTP API.
*   **Specially Crafted Payload:** Attackers must send a specially crafted request to the vulnerable API endpoint to achieve code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the exposed HTTP API of the VinChin Backup server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to identify and target the specific API endpoint with the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Craft Payload:** The attacker must craft a malicious payload that bypasses the input sanitization and leads to code execution.
*   **Hard-coded credentials (prior to fix):** Access to the vulnerable endpoint could be achieved via hard-coded credentials, prior to the applied fix.

**Affected Versions:**
*   VinChin Backup versions 5.0 up to 7.0 are affected.

**Fix Information:**
* The issue was fixed in version 7.2, where the vendor limited the methods callable with the hardcoded API key, and updated ACLs to prevent the vulnerable endpoint being reached using the hardcoded API key.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by LeakIX.
*   The vendor, VinChin, was initially unresponsive to reports of the vulnerability.
*   Public disclosure occurred due to the vendor's lack of response.
*   The vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2023-45499 which is related to hardcoded credentials, although they both relate to the same product and were discovered by the same team.
