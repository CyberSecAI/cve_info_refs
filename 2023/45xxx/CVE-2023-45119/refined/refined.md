Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45119:

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2023-45119
*   **Description:** The `n` parameter in the `/update.php?q=quiz` resource of the Online Examination System v1.0 does not sanitize user-supplied input, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root Cause:**

*   The application directly incorporates the unsanitized `n` parameter from the GET request into an SQL query without proper validation or sanitization.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is:

    ```php
    $sn=@$_GET['n'];
    ...
    $q=mysqli_query($con,"UPDATE `history` SET `score`=$s,`level`=$sn,`sahi`=$r, date= NOW()  WHERE  email = '$email' AND eid = '$eid'")or die('Error124');
    ```
    Here, `$sn` is directly used in the `UPDATE` query.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The code uses `mysqli_query` with string concatenation, which is vulnerable to SQL injection. Prepared statements or parameterized queries were not implemented.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification/Exfiltration:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to modify data in the `history` table or extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not directly stated in the provided information, in some SQL injection scenarios, it can be possible to achieve remote code execution if the attacker can trigger database functionalities that allow it.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In combination with other vulnerabilities or weak configurations, an attacker might be able to gain higher privileges in the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a malicious GET request to `/update.php?q=quiz` and injects SQL code through the `n` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable endpoint
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `n` parameter.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Online Examination System v1.0, developed by Projectworlds Pvt. Limited.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 8.8, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
*   Multiple related SQL Injection vulnerabilities were found in the same system, with similar patterns of unsanitized input being directly used in SQL queries.
*   No patch is currently available for this vulnerability
