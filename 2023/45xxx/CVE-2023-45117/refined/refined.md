Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45117:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The content from `fluidattacks.com` explicitly mentions `CVE-2023-45117` and provides detailed information about the vulnerability. It is relevant.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of input validation for the `eid` parameter in the `/update.php?q=rmquiz` resource. This parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   **Weakness:**  SQL Injection vulnerability due to unfiltered user input.
*   **Attack Vector:**  HTTP GET request to `/update.php?q=rmquiz` with a crafted `eid` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable resource.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database which could lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration: Access and steal sensitive information from the database.
    *   Data modification: Alter or delete database records.
    *   Denial of Service: Disrupt normal operations by manipulating data or database structure.

**3. Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet provided is:
```php
$eid=@$_GET['eid'];
$result = mysqli_query($con,"SELECT * FROM questions WHERE eid='$eid' ") or die('Error');
```
This shows that the `$eid` parameter obtained from the GET request is directly embedded into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**4. Additional Information:**

The `fluidattacks.com` content provides the following additional information:

*   This vulnerability is part of a group of related SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the same application (Online Examination System v1.0).
*   The vulnerability is considered "Remote" and "Authenticated" with a CVSSv3 base score of 8.8.
*   An exploit for this vulnerability is available.
*   The affected product is "Online Examination System" version 1.0, developed by Projectworlds Pvt. Limited.
*   There is no patch available for this vulnerability at the time of the report.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Andres Roldan from Fluid Attacks' Offensive Team.

**Summary of CVE-2023-45117:**

The `eid` parameter in `/update.php?q=rmquiz` is susceptible to SQL injection due to a lack of input sanitization. An authenticated attacker can inject malicious SQL code via the `eid` parameter, allowing for unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data in the database.
