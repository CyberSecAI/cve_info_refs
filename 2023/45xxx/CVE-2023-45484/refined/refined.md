Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromSetWifiGusetBasic` function of the Tenda AC10 router firmware. The `strcpy` function is used to copy the user-provided `shareSpeed` parameter into a stack buffer without any bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack buffer overflow. The `strcpy` function copies data without checking the size of the destination buffer, allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting stack memory can lead to a crash of the service, causing a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By carefully crafting the overflow data, an attacker could potentially overwrite the return address on the stack, achieving remote code execution on the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WifiGuestSet` endpoint.
- The `shareSpeed` parameter in the POST data is the vulnerable input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the Tenda router.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned in the provided content, implying that this vulnerability might be exploitable without prior authentication.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept Python script that demonstrates how to trigger the stack overflow by sending a large string as the `shareSpeed` parameter.
- The affected product and version are:
   - Vendor: Tenda
   - Product: AC10
   - Version: v4.0 V16.03.10.13
