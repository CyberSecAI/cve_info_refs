Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-45182:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure storage of passwords within IBM i Access Client Solutions. Specifically, the password encryption key can be decoded using a brute-force attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Password Storage:** Passwords are not adequately protected, as the encryption mechanism is weak and susceptible to brute-force attacks. This allows the password encryption key to be retrieved.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to the stored encrypted passwords can use a brute-force method to recover the password encryption key. This allows them to decrypt the stored passwords, potentially gaining unauthorized access to systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves gaining access to the location where passwords are encrypted and stored by IBM i Access Client Solutions. Once access is obtained, the attacker will perform a brute-force attack on the stored key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to gain access to the location where encrypted passwords are stored by IBM i Access Client Solutions. They also need the capability to perform a brute-force attack to obtain the encryption key.
