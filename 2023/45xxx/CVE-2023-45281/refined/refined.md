Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2023-45281:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the insecure handling of session cookies within the Yamcs application. Specifically, the session cookies are not set with proper flags, such as `HttpOnly` and `Secure`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Cookie Flags:** The primary weakness is the lack of the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on the session cookies.
    *   The `HttpOnly` flag, when set, prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie, thus mitigating the risk of XSS attacks stealing the session cookie.
    *   The `Secure` flag, when set, ensures the cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS connections, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Vulnerability to XSS:** The application is vulnerable to multiple Stored XSS attacks (identified as CVE-2023-45279 and CVE-2023-45280). This makes exploitation of the insecure cookies much easier for an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** By exfiltrating the session cookies, an attacker can hijack user sessions.
*   **Account Takeover:** With access to the session, the attacker can gain full access to the user's account.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can potentially use the compromised session to access and exfiltrate sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** The primary attack vector involves exploiting the existing XSS vulnerabilities to execute malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Network Interception:** If not using HTTPS, man-in-the-middle attacks could potentially intercept session cookies in transit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject code:**  The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application via XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **User interaction:** An unsuspecting user would have to visit the crafted URL containing malicious code.

**Additional Details:**

* The provided report details the process an attacker could take to steal the session cookies. They would:
    1.  Upload a malicious HTML file containing JavaScript to steal the cookies.
    2.  The victim opens the malicious HTML file through the application.
    3.  The JavaScript code exfiltrates the `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies.

This vulnerability is made more severe due to the other vulnerabilities identified within the application.
