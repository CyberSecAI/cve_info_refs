SUMMARY

Mendix Runtime contains a capture-replay flaw which could have an impact to apps built with the platform,
if certain preconditions are met that depend on the app’s model and access control design. This could
allow authenticated attackers to access or modify objects without proper authorization, or escalate
privileges in the context of the vulnerable app.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Mendix is a high productivity app platform that enables you to build and continuously improve mobile and
web applications at scale. The Mendix Platform is designed to accelerate enterprise app delivery across
your entire application development lifecycle, from ideation to deployment and operations.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-45794

A capture-replay flaw in the platform could have an impact to apps built with the platform, if certain
preconditions are met that depend on the app’s model and access control design.

This could allow authenticated attackers to access or modify objects without proper authorization, or
escalate privileges in the context of the vulnerable app.
