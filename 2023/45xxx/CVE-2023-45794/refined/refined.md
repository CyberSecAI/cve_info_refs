- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A capture-replay flaw exists in the Mendix Runtime.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows for authentication bypass by capture-replay (CWE-294).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can access or modify objects without proper authorization, or escalate privileges within the vulnerable application.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is network-based (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be authenticated (PR:L) and the attack requires a high level of complexity (AC:H) due to the necessary preconditions for exploitation. User interaction is not required (UI:N).
