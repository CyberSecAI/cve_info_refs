Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described for CVE-2023-45336:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization of the `password` parameter in the `routers/router.php` resource. Specifically, the application directly incorporates the user-provided password into an SQL query without any form of validation or escaping.
*   **Weakness:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the failure to sanitize user-supplied data before using it in a database query.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through an HTTP POST request to the `routers/router.php` endpoint, by manipulating the `password` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker doesn't need any special privileges or prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They can send a crafted POST request containing malicious SQL code in the password field to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By injecting malicious SQL code, an attacker can:
    *   Gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database.
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain control of the underlying server in some cases.
    *   Bypass authentication mechanisms if the authentication query is manipulated

**Technical Details from the Content:**

*   **Vulnerable Code:**
    ```php
    $username = $_POST['username'];
    $password = $_POST['password'];

    $result = mysqli_query($con, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password' AND role='Administrator' AND not deleted;");
    ```
*   **Explanation:** The code directly uses the `$_POST['password']` value in the SQL query without any sanitization, making it susceptible to SQL injection. An attacker can inject SQL commands by including them within the provided password value, for example: `' OR '1'='1`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content is more detailed than a typical CVE description, providing the vulnerable code snippet, the affected parameter, and the specific file path.
*   The vulnerability is part of a larger set of SQL injection vulnerabilities in the same "Online Food Ordering System v1.0", each detailed under its respective CVE identifier, according to the Fluid Attacks analysis.
*   The CVSSv3 base score of 9.8 indicates that this vulnerability is critical due to the high impact of a successful exploitation.

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-45336 highlights an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the Online Food Ordering System v1.0. This vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of user provided password input in `routers/router.php`, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries which can lead to complete compromise of the database and potential underlying system.
