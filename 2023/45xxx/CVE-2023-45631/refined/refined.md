- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, which allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically missing authorization, authentication or nonce token checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user (subscriber) can execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is present in the plugin's code, and an attacker can likely exploit it by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a WordPress account with "subscriber" privileges.
