Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-45362:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `diff-multi-sameuser` feature of MediaWiki. This feature displays a message like "X intermediate revisions by the same user not shown" when comparing two revisions of a page. The vulnerability occurs because this feature incorrectly counts intermediate revisions even when the usernames of those revisions have been suppressed (oversighted) from the revision history. This leads to an information leak by revealing the existence of suppressed edits by the same user when comparing specific revisions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The `diff-multi-sameuser` message reveals the existence of suppressed edits, even though the usernames of those edits are hidden. This bypasses the intended suppression and can lead to information disclosure.
*   **Incorrect Revision Counting:** The core issue is that the code counts all revisions between two points, without considering that revisions might be hidden.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disclosure of Suppressed User Activity:** Attackers can gain knowledge of the existence of hidden edits made by a user, which should be confidential. This undermines the privacy provided by the suppression feature.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Page Access:** By comparing two revisions on a public MediaWiki page, an attacker can trigger the `diff-multi-sameuser` message and potentially detect hidden revisions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a MediaWiki Instance:** Attackers need access to a MediaWiki instance where they can compare page revisions.
*   **Knowledge of Page Edit History:** Attackers need to know a page's history and have access to revisions before and after suppressed revisions to compare.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't require elevated privileges to trigger this vulnerability, just access to page revision history.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the `DifferenceEngine.php` file. The fix ensures that the edit count used in the `diff-multi-sameuser` message only includes revisions visible to the user performing the comparison. This was achieved by checking if a user is associated with the revision using `$revision->getUser( RevisionRecord::FOR_THIS_USER, $this->getAuthority() )`.
*   The vulnerability was present in MediaWiki versions prior to the fix and affects various MediaWiki deployments.
*   The fix was backported to multiple release branches: REL1\_35, REL1\_39, REL1\_40 and master.
*   There's a note that the vulnerability is related to the revision counts, and the behavior is the same if the suppressed diffs are created by the same user or different users.
*   A later comment suggests this may have been a misunderstanding, and that the message ignores *all* suppressed revisions, not just suppressed usernames. The behavior is the same with or without the security patch.
