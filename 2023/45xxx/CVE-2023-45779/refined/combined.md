# Security Update: APEX Modules Vulnerability FIXED

![No description]()

Fairphone

30 January 2024

[Product](https://www.fairphone.com/en/category/product/)

In November 2023, a security vulnerability was detected in an assorted list of smartphones, including the Fairphone 5, by [Meta Red Team X](https://rtx.meta.security). Fairphone took immediate action to release a security fix in mid-December that solved the issue, meaning that every Fairphone model is now secured against this vulnerability.

The vulnerability detected by Meta Red Team X affects APEX modules and the way they are signed; APEX modules allow original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to update specific portions of the system without issuing a full over-the-air (OTA)  update, but instead only delivering the subsystems that need to be updated. These modules need to be signed with the private key of the OEM during the build process, but it was found that our building process had a shortcoming, and we were using a test key (present in the Android source code build tree) instead of Fairphone’s private key.

This means that, in practice, it would have been possible for an attacker to substitute the incorrectly signed modules with other files signed with the same test key, potentially containing malicious code. Having said that, this is not easy to exploit. The substitution would require either physical access to the device, along with the debugging options activated, or remote access obtained through a chain of other critical vulnerabilities. Yet, it did present a high severity vulnerability.

Triggered by the report on Fairphone 5, we also opened an internal investigation on Fairphone 4 and Fairphone 3/3+, where we found similarly affected APEX modules. The vulnerability was resolved in December 2023 for all Fairphone devices with the following software versions, respectively:

* **Fairphone 5**: TT3Y.A.127  (*released on the 11th of December 2023*)
* **Fairphone 4**: TP20.C.087  (*released on the 25th of December 2023*)
* **Fairphone 3/3+**: 6.A.023.1  (*released on the 25th of December 2023*)

If you have not updated your phone recently, we invite you to install the most recent software version available to you. You can always check manually for system updates in the Settings menu under the System sub-menu. More information on the vulnerability can be found on the [original report](https://rtx.meta.security/exploitation/2024/01/30/Android-vendors-APEX-test-keys.html) or the [security advisory](https://github.com/metaredteam/external-disclosures/security/advisories/GHSA-wmcc-g67r-9962) published by Red Team X.

# Android Security Bulletin—December 2023

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published December 4, 2023 | Updated January 22, 2024*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Security patch levels of
2023-12-05 or later address all of these issues.
To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
[Check and update your Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705).

Android partners are notified of all issues at least a month before
publication. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the Android Open
Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin. This bulletin
also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a critical security vulnerability in the
System component that could lead to remote (proximal/adjacent) code execution
with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed
for exploitation.
The [severity assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that
exploiting the vulnerability would possibly have on an affected device,
assuming the platform and service mitigations are turned off for development
purposes or if successfully bypassed.

Refer to the [Android and Google Play Protect
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the
[Android security platform
protections](/security/enhancements)
and Google Play Protect, which improve the security of the Android platform.

**Note**: Information on the latest over-the-air
update (OTA) and firmware images for Google devices is available in the
[December 2023
Pixel Update Bulletin](/security/bulletin/pixel/2023-12-01).
## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/security/enhancements)
and service
protections such as
[Google Play
Protect](https://developers.google.com/android/play-protect). These capabilities reduce the likelihood that security
vulnerabilities could be successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all
  users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android security team actively monitors for abuse through
  [Google Play
  Protect](https://developers.google.com/android/play-protect) and warns users about
  [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](/static/security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Google Play Protect is enabled by default on
  devices
  with [Google
  Mobile
  Services](http://www.android.com/gms), and is especially important for users who install apps from
  outside of Google Play.

**Note**: There are indications that the following may be under limited, targeted exploitation.

* CVE-2023-33063
* CVE-2023-33107
* CVE-2023-33106
## 2023-12-01 security patch level vulnerability details

In the sections below, we provide details for each of the security
vulnerabilities that apply to the 2023-12-01 patch level.
Vulnerabilities are grouped under the component they affect.
Issues are described in the tables below and include CVE ID, associated
references, [type of vulnerability](#type),
[severity](/security/overview/updates-resources#severity),
and updated AOSP versions (where applicable).
When available, we link the public change that addressed the issue to the
bug ID, like the AOSP change list.
When multiple changes relate to a single bug, additional references are
linked to numbers following the bug ID.
Devices with Android 10 and later may receive security updates as well as
[Google
Play
system updates](https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439).

### Framework

The most severe vulnerability in this section could lead to remote
escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User
interaction is not needed for exploitation.

## Common questions and answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these
issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
[Check and update your Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2023-12-01 or later address
  all issues associated with the 2023-12-01 security patch
  level.
* Security patch levels of 2023-12-05 or later address
  all issues associated with the 2023-12-05 security patch
  level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2023-12-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2023-12-05]

For some devices on Android 10 or later, the Google Play system update
will have a date string that matches the 2023-12-01
security patch level.
Please see [this article](https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439?hl=en) for more details on how to
install
security updates.

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have
the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all
issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the 2023-12-01 security patch level
  must include all issues associated with that security patch level, as well as
  fixes for all issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of 2023-12-05
  or newer must include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are
addressing in a single update.

**3. What do the entries in the *Type* column mean?**

Entries in the *Type* column of the vulnerability details table
reference the classification of the security vulnerability.

| Abbreviation | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| RCE | Remote code execution |
| EoP | Elevation of privilege |
| ID | Information disclosure |
| DoS | Denial of service |
| N/A | Classification not available |

**4. What do the entries in the *References* column mean?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details
table may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference
value belongs.

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |
| U- | UNISOC reference number |

**5. What does an \* next to the Android bug ID in the *References*
column mean?**

Issues that are not publicly available have an \* next to the corresponding
reference ID. The update for that issue is generally contained in the latest
binary drivers for Pixel devices available from the
[Google
Developer site](https://developers.google.com/android/drivers).

**6. Why are security vulnerabilities split between this bulletin and
device / partner security bulletins, such as the
Pixel bulletin?**

Security vulnerabilities that are documented in this security bulletin are
required to declare the latest security patch level on Android
devices. Additional security vulnerabilities that are documented in the
device / partner security bulletins are not required for
declaring a security patch level. Android device and chipset manufacturers
may also publish security vulnerability details specific to their products,
such as
[Google](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel),
[Huawei](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/bulletin/),
[LGE](https://lgsecurity.lge.com/security_updates_mobile.html),
[Motorola](https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/software-security-page/g_id/6806),
[Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_int/security-updates),
or
[Samsung](https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb).

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Multiple Android OEMs sign APEX modules with test keys, allowing full device takeover from ADB or privileged apps

## Description

**For more detailed analysis of this issue, see [Red Team X's blog post about it](https://rtx.meta.security/exploitation/2024/01/30/Android-vendors-APEX-test-keys.html).**

Several Android devices from major OEMs ship with at least one APEX module signed by a private key that's available publicly in the AOSP source tree. Anyone who can install an APEX on such a device can gain near-total control over it. Rather than negligence by any particular OEM, we believe that unsafe defaults, poor documentation, and incomplete CTS coverage in AOSP are the main causes of this issue.

Google assigned the issue [CVE-2023-45779](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rm87-ccvw-q747 "CVE-2023-45779"), and most affected OEMs have now fixed it. Any device that comes with the Play Store is no longer vulnerable if it advertises at least a 2023-12-05 Security Patch Level (SPL).

# Vulnerability details

We analyzed OS images of recent Android devices from 14 reputable brands (listed below) and found that seven of those devices contained at least one preinstalled APEX signed only with AOSP test keys, for which anyone can produce an update.

Every vulnerable device we found had one highly-privileged vulnerable APEX in common—`com.android.vndk`. This APEX holds shared libraries that [HALs](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/hal) in the `/vendor` partition link against. Thanks to the existence of Same-Process HALs, those libraries get transitively loaded into most processes on an Android system, including

* `zygote64`, from which System Server and every app process is forked;
* `surfaceflinger`, through which all screen contents pass;
* and of course all the HALs.

We demonstrated code execution in all of the above via a malicious `com.android.vndk.v31` APEX update for a vulnerable device, a Lenovo Tab M10 Plus (Gen 3, Wi-Fi) running Android 13. You can find our proof-of-concept, as well as a script to check for vulnerable APEXes, [here](https://github.com/metaredteam/rtx-cve-2023-45779).

As an aside, `com.android.vndk` is somewhat odd because there are multiple copies of it—one for each Android API level `/vendor` can target, of which there are several thanks to [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html). Each copy has a different APEX name (e.g. `com.android.vndk.v33` for Android 13), and it's only useful to exploit the one `/vendor` actually uses. On all the devices we tested, every copy was equally vulnerable.

# Attack scenarios

Fortunately, Android tightly controls who can install APEX updates. Although APEXes look like APKs and are installed via PackageManager, the `INSTALL_APEX` flag is [restricted](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/%2B/android-14.0.0_r18%3Aframeworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/pm/PackageInstallerService.java;l=745-753) to packages that hold `android.permission.INSTALL_PACKAGES` or `android.permission.INSTALL_PACKAGE_UPDATES`, both of which are `signature|privileged` permissions and cannot be obtained by third-party apps. And even packages with that permission [must additionally](https://cs.android.com/android/_/android/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/e501fd8379b1849cd3ae4f7a0485c7890aa87179) either

* run as the `system` user
* run as the `shell` user
* be designated as "module installer" in `/{system,vendor,product,odm}/etc/sysconfig`

In practice, that limits the exploitability to four attack scenarios:

1. A user uses `adb shell` to exploit their own device, gaining access to nearly everything a typical "root" gets them. Since access is distributed across many SELinux contexts, root-aware tools and apps won't work unmodified. On the other hand, root detections won't trip: to them, the malicious APEX will be indistinguishable from legitimate OS code.
2. A malicious actor with physical access to an unlocked device uses `adb shell` to install persistent malware without the user's knowledge and gains long-term access to all data and activity on the device. The malware will likely go undetected by on-device scanners for the same reason a root will.
3. A malicious actor chains this exploit to one that gets them code execution in `com.android.vending` (the "modules installer" on all [Project Mainline](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/fresher-os-with-projects-treble-and-mainline.html) devices) or a `system` UID app to escalate their privileges and gain persistence.
4. A malicious actor who gains access to whatever Google Play backend serves APEX updates remotely exploits devices en masse. We do not know the details of Project Mainline's infrastructure so cannot assess how feasible this is. For example, it becomes far more plausible if OEMs are allowed to upload APEX updates to Google Play than if only Google is, as there are more credentials for an attacker to compromise. In that case, depending on the specifics of update targeting, a malicious OEM could potentially even exploit other OEMs' devices.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

# Missing signs: how several brands forgot to secure a key piece of Android

##

 Jan 30, 2024
 Tom Hebb, Red Team X
 About 18 mins

We recently discovered that Android devices from multiple major brands sign APEX modules—updatable units of highly-privileged OS code—using private keys from Android’s public source repository. Anyone can forge an APEX update for such a device to gain near-total control over it. Rather than negligence by any particular manufacturer (OEM), we believe that unsafe defaults, poor documentation, and incomplete CTS coverage in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) were the main causes of this issue.

Google assigned the issue [CVE-2023-45779](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45779), and most affected OEMs have now fixed it. Any device that comes with the Play Store is no longer vulnerable if it advertises at least a 2023-12-05 Security Patch Level (SPL).

## Background

[APEX modules](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/apex) allow OEMs to update certain files in an OS image without issuing a full OTA. To do so, they locate each updatable unit (e.g. Bionic or ART) in its own ext4 filesystem image inside an `.apex` ZIP file, which gets mounted under `/apex`. An initial version of each APEX is preinstalled in `/system/apex` (or `/vendor/apex`, etc) during the OS build, but those versions can be superseded by updates installed later in `/data/apex`.

To ensure APEX updates are trustworthy, Android checks that each one is signed with the same keys as the preinstalled version of that APEX. APEXes carry both a standard APK signature and an [AVB](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/avb/%2B/main/README.md) signature on their interior filesystem, and both are checked in this way. So to create a valid APEX update, one must possess both the APK and AVB private keys that were used to sign that APEX when the OS was built.

When it comes to signatures, though, an “OS build” isn’t just one step. Android’s core build system signs every APEX, APK, and OTA image it produces with a fixed set of “test keys”, and there’s no way to change that. Test keys are public in AOSP’s source tree: for example, [this](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/%2B/android-14.0.0_r18%3Aart/build/apex/com.android.art.pem) is the test key that signs the filesystem of the `com.android.art` APEX.

As described [in AOSP’s documentation](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/sign_builds), the job of re-signing a build with OEM-held “release keys” falls to a Python script called [`sign_target_files_apks`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/%2B/android-14.0.0_r18%3Abuild/make/tools/releasetools/sign_target_files_apks.py), which unpacks a built image, replaces all the signatures, and repacks it. Re-signing as a separate step has several benefits, but it also introduces the risk that not every test signature will get replaced. And that’s exactly what seems to have happened for several OEMs.

## Vulnerability details

We analyzed OS images of recent Android devices from 14 reputable brands (listed below) and found that seven of those devices contained at least one preinstalled APEX signed only with AOSP test keys, for which anyone can produce an update.

Every vulnerable device we found had one highly-privileged vulnerable APEX in common—`com.android.vndk`. This APEX holds shared libraries that [HALs](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/hal) in the `/vendor` partition link against. Thanks to the existence of Same-Process HALs, those libraries get transitively loaded into most processes on an Android system, including

* `zygote64`, from which System Server and every app process is forked;
* `surfaceflinger`, through which all screen contents pass;
* and of course all the HALs.

We demonstrated code execution in all of the above via a malicious `com.android.vndk.v31` APEX update for a vulnerable device, a Lenovo Tab M10 Plus (Gen 3, Wi-Fi) running Android 13. You can find our proof-of-concept, as well as a script to check for vulnerable APEXes, [here](https://github.com/metaredteam/rtx-cve-2023-45779).

As an aside, `com.android.vndk` is somewhat odd because there are multiple copies of it—one for each Android API level `/vendor` can target, of which there are several thanks to [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html). Each copy has a different APEX name (e.g. `com.android.vndk.v33` for Android 13), and it’s only useful to exploit the one `/vendor` actually uses. On all the devices we tested, every copy was equally vulnerable.

## Attack scenarios

Fortunately, Android tightly controls who can install APEX updates. Although APEXes look like APKs and are installed via PackageManager, the `INSTALL_APEX` flag is [restricted](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/%2B/android-14.0.0_r18%3Aframeworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/pm/PackageInstallerService.java;l=745-753) to packages that hold `android.permission.INSTALL_PACKAGES` or `android.permission.INSTALL_PACKAGE_UPDATES`, both of which are `signature|privileged` permissions and cannot be obtained by third-party apps. And even packages with that permission [must additionally](https://cs.android.com/android/_/android/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/e501fd8379b1849cd3ae4f7a0485c7890aa87179) either

* run as the `system` user
* run as the `shell` user
* be designated as “module installer” in `/{system,vendor,product,odm}/etc/sysconfig/`

In practice, that limits the exploitability to four attack scenarios:

1. A user uses `adb shell` to exploit their own device, gaining access to nearly everything a typical “root” gets them. Since access is distributed across many SELinux contexts, root-aware tools and apps won’t work unmodified. On the other hand, root detections won’t trip: to them, the malicious APEX will be indistinguishable from legitimate OS code.
2. A malicious actor with physical access to an unlocked device uses `adb shell` to install persistent malware without the user’s knowledge and gains long-term access to all data and activity on the device. The malware will likely go undetected by on-device scanners for the same reason a root will.
3. A malicious actor chains this exploit to one that gets them code execution in `com.android.vending` (the “modules installer” on all [Project Mainline](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/fresher-os-with-projects-treble-and-mainline.html) devices) or a `system` UID app to escalate their privileges and gain persistence.
4. A malicious actor who gains access to whatever Google Play backend serves APEX updates remotely exploits devices en masse. We do not know the details of Project Mainline’s infrastructure so cannot assess how feasible this is. For example, it becomes far more plausible if OEMs are allowed to upload APEX updates to Google Play than if only Google is, as there are more credentials for an attacker to compromise. In that case, depending on the specifics of update targeting, a malicious OEM could potentially even exploit other OEMs’ devices.

## Root cause

Why did so many OEMs make the exact same mistake? Recall that AOSP comes with [instructions](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/sign_builds) to re-sign a build, [a script](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/%2B/android-14.0.0_r18%3Abuild/make/tools/releasetools/sign_target_files_apks.py) to perform that re-signing, and—as a last line of defense—its extensive [Compatibility Test Suite](https://source.android.com/docs/compatibility/cts), which enforces various compatibility and security guarantees. Shouldn’t one of those have warned OEMs of vulnerable APEXes?

In answering that question, we uncovered a number of deficiencies in AOSP that, together, make it far easier to create a vulnerable build than a secure one.

### Incomplete CTS coverage

Most critically, we found that several APEXes are not checked by CTS at all. Two CTS tests look for test keys: [PackageSignatureTest](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/%2B/android-14.0.0_r18%3Acts/tests/tests/security/src/android/security/cts/PackageSignatureTest.java;l=81-109) checks both APKs and APEXes for insecure APK signatures, while [ApexSignatureVerificationTest](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/%2B/android-14.0.0_r18%3Acts/hostsidetests/appsecurity/src/android/appsecurity/cts/ApexSignatureVerificationTest.java) checks APEXes for insecure AVB signatures. But both tests hardcode lists of test keys, which over time have diverged from those actually in use. As a result, several vulnerable APEXes are not caught by either test.

The nature of APEXes makes such divergence inevitable: unlike APKs, which share [just a few test keys](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/%2B/android-14.0.0_r18%3Abuild/make/target/product/security/), APEXes all have different test keys, meaning each new APEX is a new opportunity for divergence. In our view, the only fix is for CTS to check signatures against the source of truth—the build system. In fact, the build system already records which test keys it uses to a file called `apexkeys.txt`, which plays a part in…

### Unsafe defaults

[`sign_target_files_apks`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/%2B/android-14.0.0_r18%3Abuild/make/tools/releasetools/sign_target_files_apks.py), which re-signs a build, doesn’t guarantee replacement of every test signature. On the contrary, it doesn’t replace any test signatures by default! Run without arguments, it signs each APEX and APK using the very same test keys the build system did, which it finds by parsing `apexkeys.txt` and `apkcerts.txt` respectively. We assume this default was intended as a starting state for arguments like `--key_mapping`, but we’re unsure why the absence of such arguments doesn’t result in at least a warning.

Here too, a risk that was low for APKs—forgetting to specify a test key’s replacement—became a near certainty once APEXes appeared. Because each APEX has its own test keys, each must be mapped to a release key individually. And although enumerating every APEX in Android is clearly error-prone—especially as new Android versions regularly add and remove APEXes—that’s exactly what AOSP’s documentation [instructs](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/sign_builds#apex-signing-key-replacement) OEMs to do. And speaking of that documentation…

### Poor documentation

AOSP’s “[Sign builds for release](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/sign_builds)” article begins by declaring that Android uses signatures in “two places”, APKs and OTA updates. There is no mention of APEX signatures in the introduction, nor anywhere prior to a section titled “Advanced signing options”, which gives the guidance above.

Furthermore, neither the names nor the locations of APEX test keys themselves (e.g. [this one](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/%2B/android-14.0.0_r18%3Aart/build/apex/com.android.art.pem)) make it clear that they’re test keys. In contrast, APK test keys all live in [a single directory](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/%2B/android-14.0.0_r18%3Abuild/make/target/product/security/) alongside a notice that they should “NEVER be used to sign packages in publicly released images”.

Without documentation to the contrary, an OEM might believe that APEX re-signing is optional or unimportant until CTS failures arise. They then might address those failures and think nothing more of the matter, confident that CTS and `sign_target_files_apks` know what needs signing. And who could fault them for that?

### Other factors

Although far less important than the three issues above, these two details may have also misled OEMs:

1. In `Android.bp` files, some APEXes, including `com.android.vndk`, are marked [`updatable: false`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/%2B/android-14.0.0_r18%3Apackages/modules/vndk/apex/Android.bp;l=25). That might lead OEMs to believe that such APEXes cannot be updated and so don’t need secure keys, but in fact all it means is that the build system will not “enforce additional rules for making sure that the APEX is truly updatable”.
2. `com.android.vndk` is not in Google’s [documented list of APEXes](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/modular-system). Additionally, the [AVB test key files](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/%2B/android-14.0.0_r18%3Apackages/modules/vndk/apex/com.android.vndk.pubkey) for `com.android.vndk` end in `.pubkey` rather than the more common `.avbpubkey`, which could cause naive enumeration strategies to miss them.

## Response

We reported our findings privately to Google on September 19th, 2023. Google acknowledged our report immediately, and the Android Security Team confirmed it as valid within a week. On September 25th, Google issued Partner Security Advisory 2023-11, advising its OEM partners of the issue and how to fix it. Around the same time, Google individually contacted each affected OEM we identified.

To ensure that OEMs re-signed vulnerable APEXes, Google added a test to their proprietary Build Test Suite (BTS), through which all updates to [Play Protect certified](https://www.android.com/certified/partners/) devices pass, that warned of vulnerable APEXes starting November 1st and rejected them starting December 4th for updates claiming a [December 2023 patch level](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-12-01) or higher.

Google has also fixed the deficiencies we identified in CTS. We have not seen those fixes, which won’t be made public until the release of Android V. Nonetheless, we believe the vast majority of real-world risk is now gone: OEMs have had ample time to patch their devices since Google’s initial advisory, and a spot check we performed on January 25th revealed that most have done so.

[CVE-2023-45779](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45779) was made public by Google on December 4th but contained no details. This post and [our accompanying disclosure](https://github.com/metaredteam/external-disclosures/security/advisories/GHSA-wmcc-g67r-9962) are the first public descriptions of the issue. Google plans to update the CVE with more detail after we publish this post.

## Appendix: disclosure timeline

* September 6th, 2023: We notice that an Android device we use for testing has APEXes signed with test keys, which prompts us to check other devices.
* September 13th, 2023: We complete our survey and conclude that the issue is widespread enough that Google should coordinate the response.
* September 19th, 2023: We report our findings to Google, who passes them to the Android Security Team.
* September 25th, 2023: Google releases an Android Partner Security Advisory to their OEM partners detailing the issue. The next day, they respond to us, rating the issue High Severity.
* September 28th, 2023: Google informs us of the Partner Advisory and indicates they’ve contacted affected OEMs directly.
* October 18th, 2023: Google updates the Partner Security Advisory with details on remediation, stating that the issue will be part of the December 4th Android Security Bulletin and detailing the BTS enforcement schedule.
* October 26th, 2023: We ask Google if the December ASB will contain enough details to warrant simultaneous release of this post, even if most OEMs haven’t released a fix. Google replies that the bulletin text won’t contain “specific technical information” but that they do “consider [the issue] publicly disclosed” at that point.
* November 1st: BTS purportedly begins warning OEMs when a build has vulnerable APEXes.
* November 6th, 2023: We notify affected OEMs that we’ll name them in this post on December 4th, as we believe the ASB will include CTS patches indicating APEXes have been signed with test keys. We offer to publish statements from them. We receive an automated acknowledgement from Nothing, and Nokia Corporation tells us they’ve passed the email to HMD Global, who makes Nokia-branded phones but “don’t have [a] similar responsible disclosure program”.
* November 7th, 2023: Google updates the Partner Security Advisory to add the CVE number and a note that only “builds … claiming the 2023-12-05 SPL or higher” will be subject to BTS enforcement on December 4th.
* November 13th, 2023: Lenovo confirms receipt of our email and says they don’t yet have a statement.
* Week of November 13th: Multiple OEMs create keys to re-sign their vulnerable APEXes, as evidenced by metadata in the updates they subsequently released.
* November 15th, 2023: Google asks permission to share our detection tooling with OEMs who want an offline way to find vulnerable APEXes. We grant it.
* November 15th, 2023: We ask Google explicitly if the December ASB will include CTS patches, as our plan to disclose on December 4th relies on that assumption.
* November 21st, 2023: Google sends us a generic update which formally shares the CVE ID and states in part that they “will be releasing a patch for this issue in an upcoming bulletin”.
* November 27th, 2023: We notice that the December ASB partner preview, which Meta has access to but most researchers don’t, contains no APEX-related CTS patches. We ask Google to confirm that the ASB will expose details of the issue via a patch. Google replies that CTS patches actually won’t become public until Android V and that they support us giving OEMs more time.
* November 28th, 2023: Lenovo asks us if we plan to disclose on December 4th, like our notice claimed, or on December 18th (90 days from our initial report), like Google’s Partner Advisory claimed. We reply that it’ll be 4th but we’re considering postponement given the new information from Google.
* December 1st, 2023: Lenovo follows-up on their question. We opt to officially postpone disclosure until January 30th, 2024 and notify all OEMs of the change. At this point, no OEMs had yet released fixes to our knowledge.
* December 4th, 2023: The [December ASB](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-12-01) comes out. As promised, it contains no details an attacker could use to discern the issue.
* December 7th, 2023: Fairphone thanks us for the postponement, says they intend to provide a statement, and asks permission to credit us in their own disclosure. We accept, and a couple weeks later we exchange statements and links where our respective disclosures will appear.
* January 16th, 2024: Google offers us a $7,000 bounty for our report, which we ask them on January 25th to donate to charity. (Google, like Meta, doubles bounties paid to charity.)
* January 25th, 2024: Lenovo asks for confirmation that January 30th is still our planned disclosure date, which we give.
* January 30th, 2024: This post, [our disclosure](https://github.com/metaredteam/external-disclosures/security/advisories/GHSA-wmcc-g67r-9962), [our PoC code](https://github.com/metaredteam/rtx-cve-2023-45779), and [Fairphone’s post](https://www.fairphone.com/en/2023/12/22/security-update-apex-modules-vulnerability-fixed) all go live.
