  "CVE-2023-45779": {
    "Description": "Multiple Android OEMs sign APEX modules with test keys, allowing full device takeover from ADB or privileged apps.",
    "Root cause": "Improper signing of APEX modules with test keys instead of OEM-specific private keys due to unsafe defaults, poor documentation, and incomplete CTS coverage in AOSP.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of test keys for signing APEX modules in production builds.",
      "Incomplete coverage of APEX modules in Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).",
      "Unsafe default configuration of the `sign_target_files_apks` script.",
      "Poor documentation regarding the need to re-sign APEX modules with OEM keys.",
       "Misleading naming of APEX test keys.",
       "Lack of clear guidance for OEMs to properly replace test keys"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can substitute incorrectly signed APEX modules with malicious ones, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and full device takeover. This can lead to a near-total control over the device, gaining access to nearly everything a typical 'root' gets them, persistent malware installation, and long-term access to all data and activity on the device.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Physical access with debugging options enabled.",
      "Remote access via a chain of other vulnerabilities.",
      "Installation of malicious updates through the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).",
      "Compromise of Google Play backend to push malicious APEX updates."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Physical access to the device with debugging options activated or remote access through a chain of other vulnerabilities.",
      "Ability to use ADB or exploit a vulnerability in a privileged app with permission to install APEX updates.",
      "Ability to install/substitute an APEX module."

    ],
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was discovered by Meta Red Team X. Affected devices include those from Asus, vivo, Nokia, Microsoft, Lenovo, Nothing, and Fairphone. The vulnerability affects APEX modules, especially `com.android.vndk`. Google assigned CVE-2023-45779 to the issue and most OEMs have released fixes for devices with the Play Store and a 2023-12-05 Security Patch Level (SPL) or higher.",
      "Affected Devices": [
        "Asus Zenfone 9",
        "vivo X90 Pro",
         "Nokia G50",
        "Microsoft Surface Duo 2",
        "Lenovo Tab M10 Plus (Gen 3, Wi-Fi)",
        "Nothing Phone 2",
        "Fairphone 5, 4, 3, 3+"
    ],
       "Mitigation": "The vulnerability was resolved in December 2023 for all Fairphone devices with the following software versions: Fairphone 5: TT3Y.A.127, Fairphone 4: TP20.C.087, Fairphone 3/3+: 6.A.023.1. Devices with Android 10 and later should have a security patch level of 2023-12-05 or later."
