Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-45957

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying error messages within the `AdminRequestSqlController.php` file. Specifically, the code was outputting the raw exception message using `Tools::safeOutput()`, without proper encoding, leading to a Stored XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores malicious JavaScript code within its database. This stored script is then executed when the vulnerable page is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the affected page.
- **Account Takeover:** If the attacker is successful in injecting malicious javascript, this could lead to session hijacking or account takeover.
- **Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive user information or manipulate data on the page, causing harm or misinformation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with high privileges is required to manipulate the input for the `AdminRequestSqlController`.
- The attack vector is through the admin interface. By entering specific input that causes an exception, and the raw message is then rendered in the admin interface allowing the attacker to execute malicious Javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs to have the ability to trigger an error message within the `AdminRequestSqlController` with specifically crafted input that will allow the attacker to inject and store malicious javascript within the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ulaş Deniz İlhan from Zigrin Security.
- The fix was implemented in commit `f5b2c1e0094ce53fded1443bab99a604ae8e2968`, which can be found on GitHub.
- The vulnerability was present in thirty bees version 1.4.0 and fixed in version 1.5.0.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.9, which is categorized as medium severity.
- The code change is in `controllers/admin/AdminRequestSqlController.php`
- The fix appears to have been to remove the call to Tools::safeOutput() which was outputting the raw exception message.
