Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-45342:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation in the `routers/register-router.php` resource of the "Online Food Ordering System v1.0". Specifically, the 'phone' parameter is taken directly from user input without sanitization or validation before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because user-supplied data is directly inserted into a SQL query without any form of sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Database Access:** A successful SQL injection attack can grant an attacker complete access to the database. This includes reading, modifying, or deleting any data.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could exfiltrate sensitive data such as user credentials, personal information, and order details.
*   **Application Compromise:** In some cases, SQL injection can be used to gain control over the server running the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`routers/register-router.php`).
*   **Manipulated Phone Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the 'phone' parameter in the POST request by inserting malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is unauthenticated meaning the attacker does not require any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
$phone = $_POST['phone'];

$sql = "INSERT INTO users (name, username, password, contact) VALUES ('$name', '$username', '$password', $phone);";
if($con->query($sql)==true)
```

This code directly inserts the value of `$_POST['phone']` into the SQL query without any checks, allowing for SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory lists several other related CVEs which are also SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   The vendor is listed as "Projectworlds Pvt. Limited".
*   There is no patch available for this vulnerability currently.

**Summary of CVE-2023-45342:**

The 'phone' parameter in `routers/register-router.php` in "Online Food Ordering System v1.0" is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL injection, allowing attackers to potentially gain full database access.
