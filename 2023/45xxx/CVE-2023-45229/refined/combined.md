Subject: CVE-2023-45229 and others: Multiple vulnerabilities in EDK II UEFI
 stack (PixieFAIL)

(Not associated with Quarkslab or Tianocore.)

Quarkslab has published an advisory concerning multiple
vulnerabilities in the network boot (PXE) component of Tianocore EDK
II, the open-source UEFI reference implementation. They title this
series of vulnerabilities "PixieFAIL":
<<https://blog.quarkslab.com/pixiefail-nine-vulnerabilities-in-tianocores-edk-ii-ipv6-network-stack.html>>

The introduction states:

  In order to provide [the] network booting feature, UEFI implements a
  full IP stack at the DXE phase, opening the door to attacks from the
  local network during this early stage of the boot process.
  […]
  The EDK II UEFI reference implementation provides both IPv4- and
  IPv6-based PXE. In the latest available specification (UEFI 2.10) as
  of this writing, IPv6-based PXE is described in section "24.3.18 -
  Netboot6".

  We performed a cursory inspection of NetworkPkg, Tianocore's EDK II
  PXE implementation, and identified nine vulnerabilities that can be
  exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers on the same local
  network, and in some cases, by attackers on remote networks. The
  impact of these vulnerabilities includes denial of service,
  information leakage, remote code execution, DNS cache poisoning, and
  network session hijacking.

The specific vulnerabilities included in the advisory largely, though
not exclusively, concern the IPv6 side of the network stack:

CVE-2023-45229: Integer underflow when processing IA_NA/IA_TA options
in a DHCPv6 Advertise message

CVE-2023-45230: Buffer overflow in the DHCPv6 client via a long Server
ID option

CVE-2023-45231: Out of Bounds read when handling a ND Redirect message
with truncated options

CVE-2023-45232: Infinite loop when parsing unknown options in the
Destination Options header

CVE-2023-45233: Infinite loop when parsing a PadN option in the
Destination Options header

CVE-2023-45234: Buffer overflow when processing DNS Servers option in
a DHCPv6 Advertise message

CVE-2023-45235: Buffer overflow when handling Server ID option from a
DHCPv6 proxy Advertise message

CVE-2023-45236: Predictable TCP Initial Sequence Numbers

CVE-2023-45237: Use of a Weak PseudoRandom Number Generator

Based on the Quarkslab advisory and a separate Microsoft advisory
linked therein, many ISVs that use EDK II as the base for their
proprietary BIOSes have admitted vulnerabilities. Specific PC vendors
are mostly listed as "unknown", but seems likely that the proprietary
BIOSes shipped by many of them are vulnerable.

I would guess (but have no specific knowledge) that downstream
open-source projects that use EDK II code, potentially including the
OVMF builds of it commonly used with qemu VMs, will also in many cases
be vulnerable if they are built with network boot support enabled.

### Impact

These vulnerabilities can be exploited by unauthenticated remote

attackers on the same broadcast domain (local network) and, in some

cases, by attackers on remote networks. They are exploitable on systems

that have the PXE boot option enabled. Although this option is disabled

by default, it is very common to see it enabled on server nodes in

datacenters and HPC environments. We also have reports that some laptop

computes have PXE boot enabled by default, although as the last option

in the boot order.

The impact of these vulnerabilities include denial of service,

information leakage, remote code execution, DNS cache poisoning and

network session hijacking. Exploitation of bugs 02, 06 and 07 for remote

code execution is deemed straight forward as EDK2 does not officially

employ mitigations such as stack cookies or address space layout

randomization.

### Mitigation release plan

Patch files for vulnerabilities 1-7 are available now via <https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4518>. These patches were integrated in the Feb 2024 EDK2 release ([edk2-stable202402](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/releases/tag/edk2-stable202402)).

Patch files for vulnerabilities 8-9 are available now via <https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4541> and <https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4542>. These patches were integrated in the May 2024 EDK2 release ([edk2-stable202405](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/releases/tag/edk2-stable202405)).

We are not aware of any exploits for vulnerabilities 8 and 9, either in the wild or in the lab. Exposure is limited to PXE boot or HTTP boot on an untrusted network, which is not a recommended usage for the UEFI network stack.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
