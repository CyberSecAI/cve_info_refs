An Improper Privilege Management vulnerability exists in HyperCloud that will impact the ability for a user to authenticate against the management plane.

An authenticated admin-level user may be able to delete the "admin" or "serveradmin" users, which prevents authentication from subsequently succeeding.

This issue affects HyperCloud versions 1.0 to any release before 2.1.
