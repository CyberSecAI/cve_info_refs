Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the GROWI application, specifically affecting the App Settings (/admin/app) page and the Markdown Settings (/admin/markdown) page. This arises from improper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input within these pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the vulnerable pages. When other users access these pages, the stored scripts are executed within their browsers.
- **CWE-79:** This vulnerability is categorized under CWE-79, which refers to improper neutralization of input during web page generation ('Cross-site Scripting').

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of any user accessing the affected pages.
- **Cookie Theft:** Attackers could potentially steal cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Fake Page Display:** Attackers could display fake pages or modify the appearance of the application, leading to phishing or other malicious activities.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** The attacker may be able to perform actions on behalf of the user, depending on the user's role and the application's logic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Injection via App and Markdown Settings Pages:** An attacker with appropriate privileges (likely a user with administrative rights) can inject malicious scripts through input fields or options available in the App Settings and Markdown Settings pages.
- **Stored nature:** The injected script is stored in the system. The script executes when another user views the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the GROWI application and permission to modify settings in the App Settings and/or Markdown Settings pages. This often requires the attacker to be a user with administrative or similar privileges.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable pages:**  The attacker needs to know the vulnerable pages for successful injection.
