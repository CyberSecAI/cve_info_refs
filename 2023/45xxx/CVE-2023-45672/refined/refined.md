Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45672:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the unsafe deserialization of user-provided input when saving Frigate configurations. Specifically, the `load_config_with_no_duplicates` function in `frigate/util/builtin.py` uses `yaml.load` with `yaml.loader.Loader`. This loader allows the instantiation of custom constructors, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core weakness is the use of `yaml.load` with a vulnerable loader that doesn't sanitize input, enabling the execution of arbitrary code through specially crafted YAML payloads.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `load_config_with_no_duplicates` function does not sanitize the user-provided input before parsing it, which directly leads to the unsafe deserialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Frigate.
*   **Pre-authentication RCE:** The vulnerability is described as a pre-authenticated RCE, meaning an attacker may not need to be fully authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request to `/config/save` or `/api/config/save`:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request containing a malicious YAML payload to either the `/config/save` endpoint (accessed through the Frigate UI) or the `/api/config/save` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Frigate Instance Address:** The attacker needs to know the address of the target Frigate instance.
*   **Frigate Exposed to the Internet (publicly):** The vulnerability can be exploited if the Frigate instance is accessible from the internet, even with authentication enabled.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a specially crafted link to the vulnerable Frigate instance. This link would likely contain the malicious payload.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited via the Frigate UI at `/config` or directly by calling `/api/config/save`.
*   The code snippet `!!python/object/apply:os.popen - touch /tmp/pwned` is provided as a proof of concept, showing how to execute commands on the server.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as GHSL-2023-190.
*   The issue was found using CodeQLâ€™s [Deserialization of user-controlled data query](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/python/py-unsafe-deserialization/) for Python.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `frigate/util/builtin.py` at line 110.
*   Affected versions include <= v0.12.1 and < v0.13.0 Beta 3.
*   The patched version is v0.13.0 Beta 3.

In summary, CVE-2023-45672 allows a remote attacker to achieve remote code execution on a Frigate server by exploiting unsafe deserialization when saving configuration settings. The attacker needs to know the server's address, have it publicly exposed, and trick an authenticated user to click on a malicious link or manually submit the malicious payload.
