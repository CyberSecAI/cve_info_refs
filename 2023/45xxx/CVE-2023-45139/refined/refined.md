  "cve": "CVE-2023-45139",
  "description": "As of `fonttools>=4.28.2` the subsetting module has a XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability which allows an attacker to resolve arbitrary entities when a candidate font (OT-SVG fonts), which contains a SVG table, is parsed. This allows attackers to include arbitrary files from the filesystem fontTools is running on or make web requests from the host system.",
  "affected_versions": ">=4.28.2, <4.43.0",
  "fixed_versions": ">=4.43.0",
  "root_cause": "The `fonttools` library uses `lxml` to process SVG tables in OpenType fonts and did not disable external entity expansion, which `lxml` enables by default.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "XML External Entity (XXE) Injection"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the filesystem of the host machine or make web requests.",
   "attack_vectors": [
    "Parsing a specially crafted OT-SVG font file with an affected version of fonttools."
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious OT-SVG font file to a user that is using a vulnerable version of fonttools to process it, typically via the subsetting utility.",
  "additional_info": "The vulnerability is triggered when the subsetting module parses a font with an SVG table containing a malicious external entity. The fix involves setting the `resolve_entities=False` flag in the parsing methods. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 4.43.0 and later. lxml 5.0.0 (released in December 2023) disables the expansion of external entities by default. However, applications using lxml should still disable it manually for security reasons."
