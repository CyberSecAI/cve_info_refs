Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-45277:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the storage functionality of the Yamcs API, specifically the handling of file paths in the `/api/storage/buckets/<folder>/objects` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The API does not properly sanitize or validate file paths provided in GET requests, allowing an attacker to use ".." sequences to navigate out of the intended bucket directory. This allows access to any directory and file on the server's filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, and sensitive data. As specifically demonstrated, the `/etc/passwd` file and the yaml file containing user credentials can be read.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**  Reading the user credentials file allows the attacker to compromise user accounts.
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The same endpoint using the HTTP DELETE method, allows for deleting any arbitrary file on the server file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** By sending a GET request to the vulnerable API endpoint with a crafted file path including `..` sequences, an attacker can read arbitrary files on the server.
- **HTTP DELETE Request:** By sending a DELETE request to the same endpoint, an attacker can delete arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/api/storage/buckets/<folder>/objects` endpoint.
- No authentication is mentioned as required for this specific vulnerability but access to the Yamcs API is necessary.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided article details a specific scenario where the attacker discovers the base storage directory by making a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint. This allows the attacker to then read the user credentials file.
- The fix mentioned involves using the `getCanonicalPath()` Java method to remove dots from the path.
