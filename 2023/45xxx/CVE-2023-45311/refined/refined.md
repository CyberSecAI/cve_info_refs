{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fsevents package loading a binary from an insecure hardcoded S3 bucket URL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere",
      "Insecure hardcoded S3 bucket URL",
	  "Remote Code Execution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially take over the S3 bucket and use it to conduct remote code execution by injecting malicious binaries.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack",
	  "Compromised S3 bucket"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to takeover the hardcoded S3 bucket to inject malicious binaries."
  },
  "fix": "The vulnerability was fixed by removing the loading of the remote binary in version 1.2.11 and higher.",
  "additional_notes": "The S3 bucket was taken ownership of by AWS, which blocked all access to the bucket, mitigating the straightforward attack vector."
