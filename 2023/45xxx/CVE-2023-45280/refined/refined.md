Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45280:

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-45280 is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Yamcs v5.8.6. It allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code by uploading a specially crafted display file. When a user opens this malicious display through the Yamcs telemetry menu, the injected JavaScript code executes in their browser.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data within display files, particularly those related to JavaScript execution. While Yamcs allows JavaScript execution as a core feature, the execution context in display files isn't properly restricted or filtered, allowing execution within a broad, potentially dangerous context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to store malicious JavaScript code within a display file and have it executed when a user loads that display. This allows persistent compromise.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Filtering:** The system doesn't filter or restrict JavaScript code included within display files.
*   **Overly Broad JavaScript Execution Context:** The JavaScript code within display files executes in a broad context instead of a limited or sandboxed one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** As demonstrated in the report, an attacker could exfiltrate session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system and user accounts.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could use XSS to modify data displayed to the user.
*  **Potential System Compromise:** Depending on the specific execution context and the system's configuration, a successful XSS attack could potentially lead to further system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Display File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious display file containing the JavaScript code into a Yamcs bucket.
*   **Display File Referencing Malicious JavaScript File:** The attacker uploads a Javascript file to a bucket and references the file in the display file.
*   **User Interaction:** The user accesses the malicious display file through the Telemetry Displays menu. The malicious JavaScript code is then executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Yamcs:** The attacker requires some level of access to the Yamcs system to upload a malicious display.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious HTML/JavaScript:** The attacker must be able to create display files containing malicious JavaScript code and upload them to the system.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content indicates this issue was reported as part of a larger vulnerability assessment.
*   The vulnerability is related to how display files are processed in the Yamcs system.
* The report recommends restricting the JavaScript execution context within displays.
