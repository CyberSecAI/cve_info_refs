Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the exposure of a sensitive client secret within the response of an API request made by the 'OIRASE BEER_waiting' mini-app. This secret is intended to be confidential and should not be exposed on the client-side.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The primary vulnerability is the leakage of the 'client secret' in the response of the  `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry` request. This falls under CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor).
- **Lack of Proper Secret Management:** The application does not properly handle or store the client secret, leading to its exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who obtains the client secret can then acquire a channel access token.
- **Malicious Broadcasts:** With the channel access token, the attacker can broadcast malicious messages to users of the mini-app. These messages could include links to malicious websites, fraud information, or other harmful content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing/Interception:** While not explicitly stated, the client secret is leaked via a standard HTTP request. An attacker could intercept the traffic and observe the response.
- **Client-Side Inspection:** The client-side application is exposing the secret within a response, making it easily accessible to a malicious actor who knows where to look or who simply uses a proxy to view the response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Network Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to observe network traffic to intercept the API response.
- **Line App User:** The attacker would need to have the Line app installed and the mini-app ‘OIRASE BEER\_waiting’ accessible to trigger the vulnerable request, or to know of its existence.
- **No Privileged Access Needed:** No special privileges are needed, just access to the vulnerable application within the Line app.
