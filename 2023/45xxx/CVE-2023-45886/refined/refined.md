CVE-2023-45886:
- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper handling of specially crafted BGP Path Attributes within the ZebOS BGP daemon, leading to session resets.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The BGP implementation doesn't properly handle malformed or unexpected Path Attributes, causing it to terminate the BGP session instead of ignoring the invalid data. This deviates from RFC 7606 which specifies that a BGP speaker should continue a session even if it receives malformed attributes.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can cause denial of service by disrupting BGP sessions, leading to routing instability and potentially isolating networks from the internet. This can be achieved by sending a BGP UPDATE message with crafted, malformed, or unexpected path attributes to the targeted device. A persistent attack can lead to route flapping.
- Attack vectors: A remote attacker with a valid BGP session can send specially crafted BGP UPDATE messages. The crafted message does not need to originate from a directly connected peer, as unaffected routers may forward the malformed update allowing it to reach the vulnerable system from multiple sources.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker requires a valid BGP session with a vulnerable device, either directly or indirectly.

Additional details:
- The vulnerability is related to the handling of Path Attributes, specifically the incorrect processing of malformed or unexpected attributes.
- The vulnerability is present in the ZebOS BGP daemon used by IP Infusion which is also used by F5 products, such as F5 BIG-IP.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a BGP implementation does not implement RFC 7606 and resets sessions upon encountering malformed attributes.
- The attack can be persistent because after a BGP session is restarted, the vulnerable device will process the malicious route again, and shut down the session again.
- Workarounds for some vendors include enabling error-handling options to ensure session stability.
