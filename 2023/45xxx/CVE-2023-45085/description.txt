An issue exists in SoftIron HyperCloud where compute nodes may come online immediately without following the correct initialization process.Â  In this instance, workloads may be scheduled on these nodes and deploy to a failed or erroneous state, which impacts the availability of these workloads that may be deployed during this time window.

This issue impacts HyperCloud versions from 2.0.0 to before 2.0.3.
