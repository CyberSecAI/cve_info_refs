Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45671:

**CVE-2023-45671**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `recording_clip` request handler in Frigate returns an unsanitized string based on the `camera_name` provided in the URL. This occurs because the application doesn't escape or sanitize user input before including it in the response.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page viewed by a user. This could lead to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities executed within the user's browser session.
*  **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing a malicious script in the `camera_name` parameter. The victim must click on this specially crafted link.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker must know the address of the user's Frigate instance.
    *   They need to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
    *   They need to trick an authenticated user into clicking the crafted link.
* **Additional Information:**
    * The vulnerability exists in the `/<camera_name>` API endpoints.
    * The response uses Flask's default content-type of `text/html`.
    * The vulnerability was found using CodeQL's Reflected server-side cross-site scripting query.
