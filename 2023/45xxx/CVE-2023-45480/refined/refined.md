Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `sub_47D878` function of the Tenda AC10 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack buffer overflow:** The function copies a user-supplied string (`src` parameter), read from the `deviceList` parameter of the `formSetMacFilterCfg` function, into a fixed-size stack buffer using `strcpy` without any length checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A stack overflow can lead to a crash of the service, resulting in a DoS.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By carefully crafting the overflowed data, an attacker could potentially overwrite return addresses and other critical data on the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setMacFilterCfg` endpoint.
- The `deviceList` parameter within the POST data is the vehicle for delivering the overflowing string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable Tenda AC10 router. This implies the attacker is on the same network as the router or has access to its public-facing interface if exposed to the internet.
- The attacker does not need any credentials.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Tenda AC10 V4.0 V16.03.10.13 firmware.
- The vulnerable function is `sub_47D878`.
- The `strcpy` function is used at lines 28 & 29 in the `sub_47D878` function to copy data to a stack based buffer without length checks.
- A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit is provided, demonstrating how to trigger the crash using a long string in the `deviceList` parameter.
