- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WP ULike plugin for WordPress, versions 4.6.8 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin is susceptible to XSS, allowing malicious actors to inject arbitrary scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts like redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads, which would then be executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts, which may require some level of access or the ability to manipulate input fields processed by the vulnerable plugin. The specific method of injection isn't detailed in this document. The required privilege is listed as "Contributor".
