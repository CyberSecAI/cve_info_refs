# Advisories

The CVE Program seeks to provide a common framework to identify, define, and catalogue publicly disclosed cyber security vulnerabilities. As each vulnerability is detected, reported, and assessed, a CVE ID is assigned and a CVE Record is created. This ensures information technology and cybersecurity professionals can quickly identify and coordinate efforts to prioritize and address vulnerabilities and protect systems against attack, resulting in significant time and cost savings.

Below are the vulnerabilities found by SoftIron within the HyperCloud codebase. These vulnerabilities have been published to the CVE database and any exposures have been eliminated by SoftIron.

| Impact | CVE Identifier | Published | Updated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Medium | [*CVE-2024-13058*](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-13058 "An issue exists in SoftIron HyperCloud where authenticated, but non-admin users can create data pools, which could potentially impact the performance and availability of the backend software-defined storage subsystem. This issue only impacts SoftIron HyperCloud and related software products (such as VM Squared) software versions 2.3.0 to before 2.5.0.") | 12/30/2024 | 12/30/2024 |
| Medium | [*CVE-2023-45084*](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45084 "An issue exists in SoftIron HyperCloud where drive caddy removal and reinsertion without a reboot may erroneously cause the system to recognize the caddy as new media and wipe all data on the drives due to a missing synchronization flaw, which impacts data availability and integrity. This issue only impacts SoftIron HyperCloud \"density\" storage nodes running HyperCloud software versions 1.0 to before 2.0.3.") | 12/05/2023 | 12/12/2023 |
| Medium | [*CVE-2023-45083*](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45083 "An Improper Privilege Management vulnerability exists in HyperCloud that will impact the ability for a user to authenticate against the management plane. An authenticated admin-level user may be able to delete the \"admin\" or \"serveradmin\" users, which prevents authentication from subsequently succeeding. This issue affects HyperCloud versions 1.0 to any release before 2.1.") | 12/05/2023 | 12/12/2023 |
| Low | [*CVE-2023-45085*](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45085 "An issue exists in SoftIron HyperCloud where compute nodes may come online immediately without following the correct initialization process.  In this instance, workloads may be scheduled on these nodes and deploy to a failed or erroneous state, which impacts the availability of these workloads that may be deployed during this time window. This issue impacts HyperCloud versions from 2.0.0 to before 2.0.3.") | 12/05/2023 | 12/12/2023 |
