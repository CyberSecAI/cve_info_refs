Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45121:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content from `fluidattacks.com` directly references CVE-2023-45121 and provides details about the vulnerability. The content from `projectworlds.in` lists the vulnerable software.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the lack of proper input validation for the `desc` parameter in the `/update.php?q=addquiz` resource. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an authenticated SQL Injection (SQLi). The application takes the `desc` parameter without sanitizing it and directly uses it in an SQL query.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - **Complete compromise of the database:** An attacker could exploit this to read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the application and its data.
   - **Privilege escalation:** Depending on the database configuration, a successful SQL injection could allow the attacker to execute commands on the database server or the underlying operating system.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `/update.php?q=addquiz` with a crafted SQL payload in the `desc` parameter.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to access the vulnerable endpoint and exploit this vulnerability. This is an *authenticated* SQL Injection vulnerability, not anonymous.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in version 1.0 of the "Online Examination System" by Projectworlds Pvt. Limited.
- The affected parameter is named `desc`, which is used when adding a quiz.
- The vulnerable code is:
```php
$name = $_POST['name'];
$name= ucwords(strtolower($name));
$total = $_POST['total'];
$sahi = $_POST['right'];
$wrong = $_POST['wrong'];
$time = $_POST['time'];
$tag = $_POST['tag'];
$desc = $_POST['desc'];
$id=uniqid();
$q3=mysqli_query($con,"INSERT INTO quiz VALUES  ('$id','$name' , '$sahi' , '$wrong','$total','$time' ,'$desc','$tag', NOW())");
```
- The CVSSv3 base score is 8.8, with the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`. This indicates high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- There is no patch currently available for this vulnerability.

**Summary of CVE-2023-45121:**
The vulnerability is an authenticated SQL injection that occurs due to a lack of input sanitization of the `desc` parameter in the `/update.php?q=addquiz` resource of the Online Examination System v1.0. A successful exploitation can result in full database compromise.
