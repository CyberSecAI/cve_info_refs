Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45210:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper access control of temporary data. When a user uploads a file, a randomly generated URL is created for accessing the temporary file. However, other logged-in users can potentially guess or discover these URLs, gaining unauthorized access to the temporary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The system fails to properly restrict access to temporary file URLs, allowing unauthorized users to view them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A logged-in attacker could gain access to temporary files uploaded by other users, leading to the potential leakage of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
-  An attacker must be a logged-in user (PR:L).
-  User interaction (UI:R) is required, as the attacker needs to discover the temporary URL, likely through a social engineering attack or other similar means.
-  The vulnerability's scope is unchanged (S:U), as the vulnerability is limited to the current user's session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user within the Pleasanter application.
- The attacker needs to discover the URL to a temporary file uploaded by another user. This discovery is likely not automated, requiring user interaction (e.g., a user might accidentally post the URL, or through a malicious action where a different user is tricked into revealing a temp file url).

**CVSS Metrics:**
-   **CVSS v3:** 3.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
-   **CVSS v2:** 3.5 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N)

**Additional Notes:**
-  The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.3.48.0 and later.
- The vulnerability affects both Community and Enterprise editions.
