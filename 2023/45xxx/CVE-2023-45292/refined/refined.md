Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `Verify` function within the `memoryStore` implementation of the `base64Captcha` library. The original implementation of the `Verify` method did not properly handle cases where either the `id` or the `answer` were empty strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Bypassable Verification:** The original `Verify` function would return `true` (indicating a successful verification) if the `id` was not found (resulting in an empty string `v`) and the provided answer was also an empty string. This allowed bypassing the CAPTCHA verification process.
- **Incorrect Logic:** The vulnerability resulted from an incorrect conditional check in the `Verify` method which only checked if `v == answer`, but did not consider that the empty string `v` may have meant that no value was stored for the given ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **CAPTCHA Bypass:** An attacker could bypass the CAPTCHA verification mechanism by providing a non-existent `id` and an empty `answer`.
- **Unauthorized Access/Actions:** Bypassing CAPTCHA verification could lead to unauthorized access to resources or the ability to perform actions that should be protected by CAPTCHAs.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through the `Verify` function by providing a non-existent ID and an empty string as the answer, while setting `clear` to true.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the application's CAPTCHA verification mechanism. This would require the ability to call the `Verify` method with arbitrary `id`, `answer` and `clear` parameters.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable CAPTCHA implementation and how it handles incorrect inputs.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `5ab86bd6f333aad3936f912fc52b411168dcd4a7`.
- The fix adds a check at the beginning of the `Verify` function to ensure that both `id` and `answer` are not empty strings, preventing the bypass.
- The fix also includes a new test case in `store_memory_test.go` that specifically verifies the fix for the vulnerability (CVE-2023-45292).
