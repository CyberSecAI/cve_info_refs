{
  "vulnerability": {
    "Root cause": "A flaw exists in the igb network driver for Intel Gigabit Ethernet interfaces. When the \"rx-all\" feature is enabled, an attacker on the same network segment could send packets that would overflow a receive buffer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly remote code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted network packets to an interface with 'rx-all' enabled."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target machine. The network interface of target machine must have the \"rx-all\" feature enabled."
