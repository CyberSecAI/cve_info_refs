The provided content is an Adobe Security Bulletin that lists multiple CVEs, including CVE-2023-48596.

**CVE-2023-48596**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when storing data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then executed in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser.
*  **Attack vectors:** Network-based. A malicious user injects the script into the application, which is then stored. When another user accesses the stored data, the script is executed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low-privileged user with the ability to input data into the vulnerable application. The attacker needs to be able to inject code into the application's data storage. User interaction is required to trigger the XSS, but in this case it is classified as 'Stored XSS', so the code is executed on another user's browser.
