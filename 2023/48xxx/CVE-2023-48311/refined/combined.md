# Any image allowed by default

High

[minrk](/minrk)
published
GHSA-hfgr-h3vc-p6c2
Dec 8, 2023

## Package

pip

dockerspawner
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=0.11.0,<13.0

## Patched versions

13.0

## Description

### Impact

Users of JupyterHub deployments running DockerSpawner starting with 0.11.0 without specifying `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` configuration allow users to launch *any* pullable image, instead of restricting to only the single configured image, as intended.

### Patches

Upgrade to DockerSpawner 13.

### Workarounds

Explicitly setting `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` to a non-empty list containing only the default image will result in the intended default behavior:

```
c.DockerSpawner.image = "your-image"
c.DockerSpawner.allowed_images = ["your-image"]
```

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-48311

### Weaknesses

[CWE-20](/advisories?query=cwe%3A20)
