- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `keygen.py` script in the upydev repository uses the insecure PKCS 1v1.5 padding scheme with RSA encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The use of PKCS 1v1.5 padding makes the RSA implementation vulnerable to Bleichenbacher attacks, a chosen-ciphertext attack. This allows an attacker to potentially decipher encrypted messages or forge signatures.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to decipher encrypted communications or forge signatures, compromising the privacy and integrity of communications facilitated by the tool.
- **Attack vectors:** This is a chosen-ciphertext attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to send crafted ciphertext to exploit the vulnerability, implying they have some form of interaction or knowledge of the system utilizing this vulnerable implementation.
