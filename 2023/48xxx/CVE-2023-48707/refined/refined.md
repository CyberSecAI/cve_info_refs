```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `secretKey` used for HMAC SHA256 authentication was stored in the database in plain text.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cleartext storage of sensitive information (CWE-312)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor with database access could use the `secretKey` to impersonate users by sending requests with valid HMAC SHA256 signatures.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker would need access to the database where the `secretKey` is stored.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs high level of privilege to gain access to the database."
