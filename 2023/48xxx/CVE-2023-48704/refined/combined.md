## Description

### Impact

A heap buffer overflow issue was discovered in ClickHouse server. An attacker could send a specially crafted payload to the native interface exposed by default on port 9000/tcp, triggering a bug in the decompression logic of Gorilla codec that crashes the ClickHouse server process. This attack does not require authentication.

### Patches

The issue have been addressed in ClickHouse starting from the following versions: TBA

### Workarounds

Affected users are advised to block native port access and temporary switch to HTTP protocol to reduce the exposure before they can upgrade to supported versions.

### Backport

If you are maintaining your own forked version of ClickHouse. The fix for this vulnerability can be found in [this pull request](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57107).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
