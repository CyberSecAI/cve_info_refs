{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The mini-app 'mimasaka_farm' exposes the 'channel access token' in the client-side response.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200). The channel access token, intended to secure communication within Line, is leaked to the client.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who obtains the channel access token can broadcast malicious messages to users of the 'mimasaka_farm' mini-app. This could include website links or fraudulent information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by having the client open the ‘mimasaka_farm’ mini-app on Line and capturing the server response of the request to 'www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card', which leaks the channel access token.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept or access the client-side response from the 'www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card' request to obtain the leaked access token. No specific position or privileged access is needed beyond being able to interact with the app's network communication."
