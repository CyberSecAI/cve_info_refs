Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-48540:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input, leading to stored XSS.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack (AV:N). An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server, and then executed in the browser of a victim.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) and the user needs to perform an action (UI:R) to trigger the XSS. The scope is changed (S:C) meaning the attack has access to more privileged data/functionality compared to what they would normally access. The attacker doesn't need high privileges and can carry out attacks remotely.
