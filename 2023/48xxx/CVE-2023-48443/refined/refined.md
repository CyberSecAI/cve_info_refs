- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper input validation and sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack where a user with low privileges can inject malicious script which will execute when another user renders that script in the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have low privileged access to the Adobe Experience Manager to inject the malicious code. A user interaction is also required to trigger the execution of the payload, therefore a user needs to access the malicious code through the application.
