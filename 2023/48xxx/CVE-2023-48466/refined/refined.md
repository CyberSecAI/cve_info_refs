*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to stored cross-site scripting.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors**: A malicious user can inject malicious scripts into the application that will be stored.  When a user views the page containing the injected code, the script will execute.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with the ability to inject data into the application, which will be stored and then executed by another user's browser. The attacker needs a low level of privilege to inject the malicious script, and the user viewing the content needs to interact with the page (UI:R).
