| I am now continuously fuzzing Virtuoso, and I plan to periodically report crashes in GitHub issues each time some new crashes are discovered. This time I found 8 new possible unique crashes in total and I am reporting them in the GitHub issues. Of course, if there is a more appropriate way to report these, please let me know. |

| This issue was actually fixed by another commit, as some of the issues reported by this `fuzzer` tool actually have the same root cause.  All issues are closed when they are committed to the develop/7 branch as a batch of commits.  If you want a specific commit id, you can use [77800f6](https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource/commit/77800f6e1a610add7c152fc67f2e49a07e16b15e) which is the top of the first batch of recent fuzzer fixes which includes a fix for this particular error.  However i would recommend [a1f2297](https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource/commit/a1f22974f8fb8fc485e93c425c6bf727725016f3) which is the top of develop/7 at this time, and contains the second batch of fuzzer fixes, plus a number of other fixes that may be important to you.  Note that the beta docker image pkleef/virtuoso-opensource-7:latest is built from the latter commit:  ``` $ docker pull pkleef/virtuoso-opensource-7 Using default tag: latest latest: Pulling from pkleef/virtuoso-opensource-7 Digest: sha256:e96b2866a27ef1c42d8bb998f2e5c7f5d399824b637fb5160ed7e2fd362e03d0 Status: Image is up to date for pkleef/virtuoso-opensource-7:latest docker.io/pkleef/virtuoso-opensource-7:latest  $ docker run -i -t pkleef/virtuoso-opensource-7:latest version  [pkleef/virtuoso-opensource-7:7.2.12-r17-3-g466615d-ubuntu]  This Docker image is using the following version of Virtuoso:  Virtuoso Open Source Edition (Column Store) (multi threaded) Version 7.2.12-dev.3238-pthreads as of Nov 30 2023 (a1f22974f) Compiled for Linux (x86_64-ubuntu_bionic-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1998-2023 OpenLink Software  ```  The next stable version of Virtuoso OpenSource Edition is currently scheduled for January 2024. |
