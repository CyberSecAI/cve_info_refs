The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe, which includes information about CVE-2023-48592.

**Vulnerability Details for CVE-2023-48592:**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and executed when a user views the affected page.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user's browser session.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requires low attack complexity (AC:L) and a low privileged user (PR:L).  User interaction (UI:R) is required for the attack to be successful. The scope is changed (S:C), meaning the vulnerability affects a different component than the vulnerable one.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have low privileges on the system to inject the malicious script, which then executes when a user interacts with the affected page.
