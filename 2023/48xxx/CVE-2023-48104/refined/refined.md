Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-48104:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

   - The provided content, specifically the commit message `fix(hmtl): prevent html injection of tag form` in the GitHub commit log from `Alinto/sogo` and the explanation within the `habr.com` article, clearly relates to HTML injection vulnerability. The github.com repository `E1tex/CVE-2023-48104` is also directly related to this CVE, confirming that the content is relevant.

**2. Extracted Information:**

   - **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
     - The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input, specifically within the email body of the SOGo web client. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML. The `habr.com` article provides extensive explanation and examples of HTML injection. The fix in `Alinto/sogo` commit targets the `<form>` tag, which was not properly sanitized.
     - The `habr.com` article generally covers the underlying concepts, types, and exploitation methods of HTML injection. The article also emphasizes that HTML injection can lead to XSS attacks when JavaScript is also injected.

   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
     - **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of HTML input. This enables an attacker to inject malicious HTML elements into the email body that the recipient renders.
     - **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The SOGo web client did not properly filter out or escape HTML tags, particularly the `<form>` tag, allowing for the injection. The `habr.com` article illustrates how to bypass input validation, if it exists.

   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
      - **Phishing:** The most immediate impact is the ability to conduct phishing attacks. By injecting a malicious `<form>` into an email, an attacker can trick users into submitting sensitive data (e.g., usernames, passwords) to a malicious server.
      - **Potential for XSS:**  While the specific fix addresses the `<form>` tag, the overall lack of input sanitization could also open the door to other types of injections, potentially leading to XSS (though not explicitly stated for this CVE, the `habr.com` article explains the link between HTML injection and XSS). The `habr.com` article explains several forms of HTML scriptless injection and includes discussion of DOM-based, stored and reflected forms of HTML injection.
      - **Defacement:** The injected HTML could alter the appearance of the email, potentially displaying misleading or harmful content.
      - **Data theft:** As explained in `habr.com` article, various techniques exist for stealing data, even without javascript, such as using the `<base>` and `<form>` tags.

   - **Attack Vectors:**
     - **Email Body:** The primary attack vector is injecting malicious HTML code into the body of an email within the SOGo web client.
     - **Social Engineering:** An attacker would need to send a crafted email to a target user, leveraging social engineering to make the recipient interact with the injected content (e.g. submit the form).
       - The `habr.com` article also covers other attack vectors, such as URL parameters, cookies, and HTTP headers, although these are not specific to the CVE at hand.

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - The attacker needs to be able to send emails to users of the vulnerable SOGo web client.
     - The attacker does not need any special privileges on the server, only the ability to send an email that the client will render.

**3. Additional Notes:**

   - **Commit Details:** The commit `7481ccf37087c3f456d7e5a844da01d0f8883098` from `Alinto/sogo` shows the specific fix, which involves sanitizing HTML input by replacing `<form>` and `</form>` tags with placeholders.
    - The commit also introduces changes to `Tests/Unit/TestNSString+Utilities.m` to verify the fix.
   - **PoC Details:** The `E1tex/CVE-2023-48104` repository on github provides a PoC exploit (`sogopoc.py`) that can be used to verify the vulnerability on a vulnerable SOGo client and provides additional details on affected versions of SOGo web mail (<5.9.1).
   - The `habr.com` article provides more in-depth explanation of HTML injection, including several attack vectors and techniques, going far beyond the scope of this CVE.
   - The `habr.com` article mentions that the author of the article is the discoverer of this CVE.

In summary, CVE-2023-48104 is an HTML injection vulnerability in the SOGo web client that allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML into the email body. The primary impact of this vulnerability is the ability to conduct phishing attacks by tricking users into submitting sensitive information through injected forms.
