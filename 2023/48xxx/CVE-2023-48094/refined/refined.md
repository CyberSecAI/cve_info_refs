- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `Apps/Sandcastle/standalone.html` file of CesiumJS. It creates a script tag using unsanitized `location.hash`, leading to DOM-based XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to sanitize user-controlled data (`location.hash`) before using it to generate a script tag.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL that exploits the DOM-based XSS in `Apps/Sandcastle/standalone.html`. The attacker needs to send this crafted URL to the victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and have a victim open it in their browser.
