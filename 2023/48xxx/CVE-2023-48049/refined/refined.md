Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and the direct use of unsanitized user-supplied data within an SQL query. Specifically, the `name` parameter in the `search_contents` function of `controllers/main.py` is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application constructs SQL queries dynamically using user-controlled input without sanitization or using parameterized queries/prepared statements. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
- Lack of input validation: The application does not perform input validation or sanitization on the `name` parameter, allowing the attacker to insert malicious SQL code.
- No access control check: The affected controller route (`/blog/search`) does not require authentication, enabling anyone to exploit the vulnerability.
- Direct database cursor usage: The application directly uses a database cursor without proper access rights checks, further exacerbating the issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
- Privilege escalation: By injecting SQL, an attacker can modify user privileges in the database, potentially gaining administrative access by changing the password of an existing user like the `admin` user, or creating a new admin user.
- Information disclosure: An attacker can read sensitive data from the database by crafting specific SQL queries.
- Data tampering: An attacker can modify data within the database, leading to data integrity issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attacker over HTTP: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted HTTP POST request.
- The target route is `/blog/search/`.
- The malicious SQL is sent in the `"name"` parameter within the POST body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected Odoo instance with the `website_search_blog` module installed.
- No authentication is required.
- Knowledge of SQL syntax is required to craft the attack.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided text also includes a sample PoC SQL injection payload designed to update the password of the `admin` user.
- The documentation suggests a fix using prepared statements.
- The module versions affected are 13.0 thru 13.0.1.0.1.
