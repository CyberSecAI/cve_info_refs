A vulnerability has been identified in SINEC INS (All versions < V1.0 SP2 Update 2). Affected products do not properly validate the certificate of the configured UMC server. This could allow an attacker to intercept credentials that are sent to the UMC server as well as to manipulate responses, potentially allowing an attacker to escalate privileges.
