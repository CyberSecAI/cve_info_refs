Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-48122:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application transmits login credentials (username and password) via an HTTP GET request instead of a POST request. This is due to the use of `$_GET` parameters for login, making the credentials visible in the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use of GET Request Method with Sensitive Query Strings (CWE-598):** Login credentials are sent as part of the URL, which can be logged by web servers, browsers, and proxies, increasing the risk of exposure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker can intercept and obtain login credentials from network traffic (e.g., through proxy logs, browser history, or network sniffing). This would allow them to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network traffic interception:** An attacker could intercept the HTTP GET request to obtain the login information.
- **URL logging:** Credentials might be stored in logs by web servers, browsers, or proxies.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to monitor network traffic between the user and the server (man-in-the-middle) or be able to access server logs or browser history of the user.
- The attacker does not need any prior access or authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in microweber version 2.0.1 and was fixed in version 2.0.4.
- The issue was reported on GitHub issue #1042.
- The vulnerable code snippet identified involves handling the `redirect` parameter using `$_GET` and rendering it into a hidden input field which is not the root cause of the vulnerability.
- The issue is that the login form sends credentials through the URL parameters instead of POST data.
