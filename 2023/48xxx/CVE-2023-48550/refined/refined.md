The provided document contains vulnerability information for multiple CVEs, including CVE-2023-48550.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2023-48550:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   The application is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This occurs when user-supplied input is stored on the server and later displayed to other users without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Network-based attack.
*   The attacker injects malicious script through a vulnerable part of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   A low-privileged user can inject the malicious code that is later executed when a victim views the content.
*   User interaction is required because the victim has to load the page containing the malicious code

**CVSS Metrics:**
*   CVSS base score: 5.4
*   CVSS vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
