Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2023-48105** is not explicitly mentioned, but the content from the provided github.com page for issue #2726 describes a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in `wasm_loader_prepare_bytecode` function, which is related to the fix in the provided github.com pull request #2734 which contains commit `4785d91b16dd49c09a96835de2d9c7b077543fa4` mentioned in the description of the commit that addresses this issue. This suggests the issue is likely the one tracked by CVE-2023-48105.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing or insufficient bounds check in the `wasm_loader_prepare_bytecode` function when processing a specific byte sequence in the WebAssembly binary. The vulnerability is located at `/core/iwasm/interpreter/wasm_loader.c:7141`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A heap out-of-bounds read of size 1 occurs when parsing a specially crafted WebAssembly file due to the lack of proper boundary checks during bytecode preparation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a heap out-of-bounds read, which can lead to a crash. It may be possible to corrupt heap metadata and gain further control, although this isn't explicitly demonstrated in the provided information. The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) report shows that a crash was triggered.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted WebAssembly file, which is provided in the provided PoC.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious WebAssembly file to be loaded and processed by the vulnerable iwasm component.

**Additional Details:**
The issue was reported with ASAN error logs indicating a heap-buffer-overflow at `wasm_loader_prepare_bytecode` in the `wasm-micro-runtime`. The provided commit `4785d91b16dd49c09a96835de2d9c7b077543fa4` adds additional buffer boundary checks in wasm loader, specifically at the points indicated by the code diff in `wasm_loader.c` included in the provided content, fixing the heap out-of-bounds read.
The vulnerable code is in the function `wasm_loader_prepare_bytecode` at `/core/iwasm/interpreter/wasm_loader.c:7141`. This function is used to process and prepare the bytecode of a WebAssembly module. The vulnerability is a missing bounds check before reading a byte within the bytecode, allowing for an out-of-bounds read. The ASAN output shows the specific location of the crash.
The fix adds the macro `CHECK_BUF` before the read, ensuring that the read is safe. This macro ensures that the current position of the buffer is within the bounds.

The information extracted provides more detail than the basic CVE description, especially in terms of root cause, vulnerable function and fix.
