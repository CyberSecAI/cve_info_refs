The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe regarding multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). It includes CVE-2023-48497, along with many others.

Here's the information extracted for CVE-2023-48497:

**Vulnerability Details**
*   **Vulnerability Category**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) ([CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html))
*   **Vulnerability Impact**: Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity**: Important
*   **CVSS base score**: 5.4
*   **CVSS vector**: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*  **CVE Number**: CVE-2023-48497

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a stored Cross-site Scripting vulnerability

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This occurs when malicious script is stored on the server, and executed when other users access the stored data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
*   The attack requires a user with low privileges (PR:L) to store the malicious script.
*   User interaction is required (UI:R) for the stored script to be executed. The scope is changed (S:C), meaning the vulnerable component can impact other components within the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a user with low privileges in the application, meaning they must have an account with the application, and an ability to add and store content.
*   The attacker must be able to trick other users into triggering the stored script, which would then execute in their browser session.

**Additional notes:**
*   The bulletin lists many other XSS vulnerabilities, all with similar CVSS scores and vectors, suggesting a pattern of vulnerability within the application.
*   The bulletin recommends updating to specific AEM versions to remediate these vulnerabilities.
