- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization or output encoding.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based exploitation via a crafted request to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - For most XSS vulnerabilities (CVSS 5.4) a low privileged user is required to inject malicious script, and another user must interact with it by opening a page with injected malicious script.
    - Some XSS vulnerabilities (CVSS 6.1) can be triggered by unauthenticated user by tricking a user to open a page with injected malicious script.
    - Some XSS vulnerabilities (CVSS 4.6-4.8) require a high-privileged user to inject the malicious script which will affect other users.
