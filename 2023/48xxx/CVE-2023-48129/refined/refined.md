Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The mini-app 'kimono-oldnew' on Line exposes the 'channel access token' in the client-side response. This token is meant to be a secret and is used for securing communication within Line.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200):** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the channel access token in the response of the `/miniapp/members_card` request. This is a sensitive credential that should never be accessible client-side.
- The application does not properly protect or handle the 'channel access token', which leads to its disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who obtains the channel access token can gain unauthorized access to the Line communication channel.
- **Malicious Broadcasts:** The attacker can use the compromised channel to broadcast malicious messages to users of the 'kimono-oldnew' mini-app. These messages could include phishing links, fraudulent information, or other harmful content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Interception:** An attacker could intercept the network traffic from the Line app when it accesses the mini-app 'kimono-oldnew'.
- **Client-Side Access:** The vulnerability is due to the token being available in the client-side response of the `/miniapp/members_card` endpoint, so the attacker could directly access the resource through the mini-app.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic from the Line app or access the client-side response of the vulnerable request.
- The attacker would need to use the Line application and access the 'kimono-oldnew' mini-app.
- No special privileges on the victim's device are required besides using the Line application.

**Additional Details:**

- The affected product is identified as the 'kimono-oldnew' mini-app on Line.
- The affected version is specifically Line 13.6.1.
- The content provides detailed screenshots showing where the token is leaked in the response and how it's intended to be used based on official Line documentation.
- The provided content is more descriptive than a standard CVE description, including details of how to access the vulnerable app and visual proof.
