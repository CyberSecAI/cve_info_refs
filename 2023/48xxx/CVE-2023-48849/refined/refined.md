**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation and filtering

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows unauthenticated attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code on the affected routers. This includes executing commands such as `id` and `grep`
- Complete compromise of the device, due to remote code execution as root

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks by sending crafted requests

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
