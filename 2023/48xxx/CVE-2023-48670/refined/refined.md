- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A privilege escalation vulnerability exists within the Dell SupportAssist for Home PCs installer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The installer allows a low-privileged authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This indicates a flaw in how the installer handles permissions or executes processes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, leading to full system compromise. This includes potential unauthorized access, data theft, malware installation and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of authorized access to the machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  A low-privileged authenticated attacker is required. The attacker must have some level of legitimate access to the system to run the installer. The user interaction requirement is a 'User Interaction Required', which means an action from the user might be needed.
