- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, specifically a command injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection (CWE-77). Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the "Schedule System Backup page" field, allowing the injection of malicious OS commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker with at least read/write permission can execute arbitrary OS commands on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:**  A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending specifically crafted arguments via the "Schedule System Backup page" field in the FortiPortal GUI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be authenticated and have at least read/write (R/W) permissions on the system.
    - The attacker must have network access to the FortiPortal system.
