**CVE-2023-48621**
*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS).
*   **Weaknesses:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored within the application.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of a user's browser session.
*   **Attack Vector:** A network-based attack.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker with low privileges can inject malicious scripts. Exploitation requires a user to interact with the stored malicious content via the application (UI:R).

The document also lists a number of other CVEs, which are all XSS vulnerabilities except CVE-2023-48441, which is an improper access control issue. The document lists the affected product versions, the solution (updating to the newest version), and acknowledgements to researchers.
