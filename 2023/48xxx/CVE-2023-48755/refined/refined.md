- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The teachPress WordPress plugin <= 9.0.4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or data breaches. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to induce a logged-in user to unknowingly trigger a malicious request. This is usually done by enticing a user to click on a malicious link or visit a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs to trick a logged-in user into executing an unwanted action.
