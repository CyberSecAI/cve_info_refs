- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input validation on the `index` parameter in the `/goform/wifiSSIDget` endpoint. The `sprintf` function is used to process this parameter without checking its length, leading to a stack buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack buffer overflow vulnerability due to unbounded usage of `sprintf` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the router.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through sending an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/wifiSSIDget` endpoint with an overly long `index` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router. The provided PoC script suggests this is typically done within the same network.
