  "CVE-2023-48255": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can send malicious network requests containing arbitrary client-side script code and obtain its execution inside a victimâ€™s session. This could lead to unauthorized actions within the victim's session, such as potentially stealing session cookies or sensitive information.",
     "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted network request containing malicious client-side script code. The vulnerable application logs the malicious script, and when a victim views the log, the script is executed within their session.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send a crafted network request to the vulnerable device, and no authentication is required. The attack also requires a victim to view the poisoned log."
