The provided content is related to CVE-2023-48620.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause of the vulnerability is Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The document lists multiple instances of stored XSS vulnerabilities, with CWE-79 as the common weakness for all of them. There is also one instance of Improper Access Control (CWE-284).

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the Stored XSS vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution. The Improper Access Control vulnerability could result in a security feature bypass.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector for all listed vulnerabilities is network-based (AV:N). The XSS vulnerabilities require a user interaction (UI:R) and low privileges (PR:L), except for some which require no privileges (PR:N), or high privileges (PR:H). The Improper Access Control vulnerability requires no user interaction (UI:N) and no privileges (PR:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious script into the application to exploit the stored XSS vulnerabilities. For the Improper Access Control, an attacker needs to send a request to bypass security feature.
