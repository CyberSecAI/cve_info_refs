Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-48518:

**Vulnerability:**
*   **Type:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Important
*   **CVSS Base Score:** 5.4
*  **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**Root Cause:** The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. This means that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized and is stored on the server, which is later displayed to other users without proper encoding, allowing the execution of malicious scripts in their browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding, which allows malicious scripts to be stored and subsequently executed within the application's context.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the victim's browser. This could potentially lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is relatively easy to execute.
*   **Low Privileges Required (PR:L):** An attacker requires low privileges within the application to inject the malicious script.
*   **User Interaction Required (UI:R):** The victim needs to interact with the application (e.g., by viewing a page where the malicious code was stored) for the exploit to occur.
*   **Scope Changed (S:C):** The vulnerability changes the security scope, meaning the injected script will execute within the security context of the web application.
*   **Low Confidentiality Impact (C:L):** The attacker can gain limited access to confidential information.
*   **Low Integrity Impact (I:L):** The attacker can make limited changes to data.
*   **No Availability Impact (A:N):** The vulnerability does not impact the availability of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to have low-level privileges within the Adobe Experience Manager application to inject malicious script.
* The attacker needs to be able to access the application over the network.
* The attacker requires a victim to trigger the malicious script by accessing the content where the malicious code was stored.
