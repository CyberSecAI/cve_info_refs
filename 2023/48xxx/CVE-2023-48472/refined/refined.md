Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-48472:

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to Stored XSS (CWE-79). This means that an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application's database, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution. This could allow an attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or modifying content.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), with low attack complexity (AC:L) and low privileges needed (PR:L) by a logged in user. User interaction is required (UI:R) and the scope is unchanged (S:U).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the ability to inject a malicious script into the AEM system. The attacker needs to induce a victim to interact with the injected code.

This document provides more detail than a typical CVE description by including the specific CVSS vector string and describing that the attack vector is network-based, that user interaction is required, and that the scope is unchanged.
