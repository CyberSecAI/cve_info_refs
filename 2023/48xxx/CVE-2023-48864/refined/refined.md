Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-48864

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `web_inc.php` file of Semcms v4.8. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation of the `languageID` parameter received via POST request. This parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows attackers to manipulate database queries.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `verify_str()` function uses a blacklist approach which is insufficient for preventing SQL injection. The `test_input()` function filters only backslashes, single quotes, and double quotes which are not used in the vulnerable query, and therefore ineffective.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing them to extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Depending on the database permissions and the system configuration, the vulnerability could potentially be used to modify data or gain further access to the system

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to `index.php` or other entry points of the application that uses `web_inc.php`, including the vulnerable `languageID` parameter containing the crafted SQL injection payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is accessible without requiring prior authentication.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the necessary payloads.

**Additional details:**
- The `verify_str` function uses a blacklist, which is easily bypassed, as the vulnerability is not dependent on single or double quotes. The `test_input` function does not provide adequate sanitization.
- The vulnerability is located in the `web_inc.php` file, specifically line 88, where the `languageID` is used in the SQL query without proper sanitization.
- The provided proof of concept (POC) python script demonstrates successful exploitation, confirming the vulnerability's severity.
- The provided details are more descriptive than the typical CVE description, detailing vulnerable code lines and methods of exploitation.
