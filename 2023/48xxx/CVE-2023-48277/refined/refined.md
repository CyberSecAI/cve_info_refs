- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, leading to broken access control. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken access control, specifically missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An unprivileged user can perform actions that should require higher privileges, though the specific impact varies case-by-case.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
