The provided document is an Adobe Security Bulletin (APSB23-72) that details security updates for Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). It lists numerous CVEs, including CVE-2023-48572.

Here's the relevant information regarding CVE-2023-48572:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application improperly sanitizes or encodes user-supplied input before storing it, allowing malicious scripts to be injected and stored in the application's data store. These scripts are then executed when a user views the data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation of the stored XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user's browser session.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack is performed over the network.
- The attacker injects malicious script which gets stored on the server.
- When a user views the affected page, the stored malicious script is executed within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a low privilege account in order to inject malicious scripts which can be stored on the server.
- User interaction (victim has to view the page): The exploit requires the victim to interact with the application by loading a page containing the stored malicious script for the XSS to execute.

**CVSS:**
- CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N
-  AV:N (Network) - The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
- AC:L (Low) - The attack requires no special conditions to be exploited
- PR:L (Low) - A low privilege user is required for exploitation.
- UI:R (Required) - User interaction is required to execute the attack.
- S:C (Changed) - The vulnerability scope is changed because it affects a different security context.
- C:L (Low) - Impact to confidentiality is low.
- I:N (None) - No impact to integrity.
- A:N (None) - No impact to availability.
