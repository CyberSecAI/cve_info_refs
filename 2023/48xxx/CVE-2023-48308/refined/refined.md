Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-48308:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the Nextcloud Calendar app returning a full stack trace when an error occurs while editing a calendar appointment. This exposes internal server paths and other sensitive debugging information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The application discloses sensitive information (stack traces, internal paths) to potentially unauthorized users.
- **Inadequate Error Handling:** The application does not properly handle exceptions, leading to the exposure of detailed error information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain access to sensitive information about the server's internal structure, including file paths. This information could be used in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack. An attacker can trigger an exception by sending malformed or unusual data while editing a calendar appointment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have low-level access to the Nextcloud instance and the ability to interact with the calendar app by editing calendar appointments.
- User interaction is required, implying the attacker must be able to manipulate the application.
