- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N), but needs the user to interact with a malicious file/data to trigger the out-of-bounds write condition.
