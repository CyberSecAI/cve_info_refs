Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The mini-app 'Luxe Beauty Clinic' on Line exposes a critical credential, the 'channel access token,' to the client-side.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200):** The channel access token, which is meant to secure communication within Line, is leaked to the client-side.
*   **Insecure Storage:** The token is present in the response of a request, which is accessible by the client, indicating a lack of proper protection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Message Broadcasting:** An attacker can use the exposed channel access token to broadcast malicious messages to users of the 'Luxe Beauty Clinic' mini-app. This could include:
    *   Malicious website links
    *   Fraudulent information
    *   Other unwanted or harmful content

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Request Interception:** The attacker needs to intercept the response of the request to `www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card` from the victim's client (Line application). The response contains the channel access token.
*   **Client-Side Access:** The token is exposed on the client-side, meaning any user with access to the response from the request within the Line app can potentially obtain it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Basic Line Application usage:** The attacker needs to be able to open the mini-app 'Luxe Beauty Clinic' within the Line application.
*   **Network Interception (Optional):** While not explicitly stated, the attacker may need basic network analysis capabilities to access the request/response and extract the token. However, since the token is leaked client-side, an attacker could simply access the network traffic of their own device to obtain the token.

**Additional Details:**
*   The document mentions that the channel access token is used in the "Authorization" header of requests to `https://api.line.me/message/v3/notifier/token`, which is consistent with how channel access tokens are used.
* The document mentions the official description of channel access token which highlights the importance of keeping it secret.

This information provides more detail than a basic CVE description and clearly outlines how the vulnerability can be exploited.
