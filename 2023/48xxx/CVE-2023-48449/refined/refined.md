The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe, detailing multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). It specifically lists CVE-2023-48449 as a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-48449:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a Stored XSS vulnerability, meaning that malicious script can be permanently stored within the application and executed when a user views the affected content.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) and requires low privileges (PR:L) and user interaction (UI:R). The attack requires that the user interacts with the malicious payload in order to trigger the vulnerability
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have low privileges, be able to inject malicious code into the system and then have a user interact with that stored code.

The bulletin provides a CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N` which translates to:

*   **AV:N** (Attack Vector: Network)
*   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low)
*   **PR:L** (Privileges Required: Low)
*   **UI:R** (User Interaction: Required)
*   **S:C** (Scope: Changed)
*   **C:L** (Confidentiality Impact: Low)
*   **I:L** (Integrity Impact: Low)
*   **A:N** (Availability Impact: None)
