This document provides details for multiple CVEs, including CVE-2023-48593.

**CVE-2023-48593**
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input sanitization or output encoding, allowing the injection of malicious scripts into the application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, where a malicious script is stored within the application's data and executed when a user views the affected page or component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged attacker needs the ability to store the malicious script. This typically requires an authenticated user to be able to input content. The user would also have to interact with the injected script by loading a page or component containing the payload.

The document also lists many other CVEs, all related to either Stored XSS or improper access control within Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).
