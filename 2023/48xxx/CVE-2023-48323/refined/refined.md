- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Awesome Support WordPress plugin versions 6.1.4 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability, which allows an attacker to force a higher privileged user to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially force higher privileged users to execute actions they did not intend to, under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary depending on the action performed.
- **Attack vectors:** This is a CSRF vulnerability. The attacker would need to trick a logged-in, higher privileged user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website, which would then make a forged request to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into making a malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
