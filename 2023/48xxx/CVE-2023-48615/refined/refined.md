This document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2023-48615.

**CVE-2023-48615**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS (CWE-79). This means that an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which are then stored and executed when other users access the affected content.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data, modify content, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The attacker needs to inject malicious code into the application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) and the user needs to interact with the malicious content (UI:R). The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C).
