WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to application webserver for trusted users only

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEC INS (Infrastructure Network Services) is a web-based application that combines various network
services in one tool. This simplifies installation and administration of all network services relevant for
industrial networks.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-0464

A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions of OpenSSL related to the
verification of X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit
this vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers exponential use of computational
resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on affected systems.

Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the -policy argument to the
command line utilities or by calling the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() function.

CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation

Vulnerability CVE-2023-27538

libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when an SSH related option had been
changed that should have prohibited reuse. libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection
pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, two SSH settings
were left out from the configuration match checks, making them match too easily.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-48427

Affected products do not properly validate the certificate of the configured UMC server. This could
allow an attacker to intercept credentials that are sent to the UMC server as well as to manipulate
responses, potentially allowing an attacker to escalate privileges.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-48428

The radius configuration mechanism of affected products does not correctly check uploaded certificates.
A malicious admin could upload a crafted certificate resulting in a denial-of-service condition or
potentially issue commands on system level.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-48429

The Web UI of affected devices does not check the length of parameters in certain conditions. This
allows a malicious admin to crash the server by sending a crafted request to the server. The server
will automatically restart.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-48430

The REST API of affected devices does not check the length of parameters in certain conditions. This
allows a malicious admin to crash the server by sending a crafted request to the API. The server will
automatically restart.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-48431

Affected software does not correctly validate the response received by an UMC server. An attacker
can use this to crash the affected software by providing and configuring a malicious UMC server or by
manipulating the traffic from a legitimate UMC server (i.e. leveraging CVE-2023-48427).
