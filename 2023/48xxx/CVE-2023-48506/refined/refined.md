The provided content is related to CVE-2023-48506.

**Vulnerability Details:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Important
*   **CVSS Score:** 5.4
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   **Affected Product:** Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
*   **Affected Versions:** AEM Cloud Service (CS) and 6.5.18.0 and earlier versions

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability (CWE-79), which arises when user-supplied data is stored and later displayed without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses:**
The weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding of user-supplied data. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, requiring a user interaction. Specifically, a malicious script is stored (most likely by a low-privileged authenticated user) and then executed when another user accesses the stored content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be a low-privileged authenticated user to store the malicious script in a susceptible location. They also need to convince another user to interact with the stored malicious content.
