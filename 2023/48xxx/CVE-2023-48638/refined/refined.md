Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-48638:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an **Out-of-bounds Read** vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-125:** Out-of-bounds Read. This means the software is reading data from a memory location that is outside of the intended buffer or allocated memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory leak:** Successful exploitation leads to a memory leak, as the program reads from unauthorized memory locations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access (AV:L):** The attack requires local access to the system.
*   **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The vulnerability is easily exploitable.
*   **No Privileges Required (PR:N):** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required (UI:R):** The attacker needs to trick a user into performing some action, such as opening a specially crafted file.
*   **No Scope Change (S:U):** The vulnerability's impact is limited to the application itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to have local access to the system running the vulnerable software (Adobe Substance 3D Designer).
*   The attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious file to trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**CVSS Vector:**

*   CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as "Important".
*   This vulnerability is one of four vulnerabilities addressed in the APSB23-76 security bulletin, with the other three being CVE-2023-48639 (Out-of-bounds Write leading to arbitrary code execution), CVE-2023-48636, and CVE-2023-48637 (both Out-of-bounds Reads leading to memory leaks).
*   The fix is to update Adobe Substance 3D Designer to version 13.1.0 or later.
