- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**:  The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` indicates:
    - **AV:L** (Local): The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system.
    - **AC:L** (Low): The attack complexity is low, which means that the exploit is easy to perform.
    - **PR:N** (None): No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **UI:R** (Required): User interaction is required, meaning the user needs to perform some action to trigger the vulnerability.
    - **S:U** (Unchanged): The security scope is unchanged
    - **C:H** (High): Impact to Confidentiality is high.
    - **I:H** (High): Impact to Integrity is high.
    - **A:H** (High): Impact to Availability is high.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system and the user needs to perform an action to trigger the vulnerability.
