The provided document is an Adobe security bulletin that details multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-48622.

**CVE-2023-48622:**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and later executed when other users access the affected content.
*  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's browser, which could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attack, where the attacker injects malicious scripts into the application via a network request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have a low level of privileges (PR:L) and needs the victim to interact with the crafted malicious code (UI:R). The attack is also scoped to the affected component (S:C), which means only users interacting with the vulnerable part of the application are affected.
