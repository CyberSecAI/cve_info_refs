#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Create a comment on the wiki with an image with URL /xwiki/bin/view/Admin/RunShellCommand?command=touch%20/tmp/attacked
2. Wait for an admin to view the comment.

**Expected result:**

No file is created in /tmp

**Actual result:**

A file "attacked" is created in /tmp.

Note that the same attack vector can also be used for XWiki syntax injection by simply echoing the desired syntax prefixed by

```
{{/code}}
```

which may be more useful to executed Groovy code with programming right.

# Run Shell Command allows CSRF RCE attacks

Critical

[michitux](/michitux)
published
GHSA-8jpr-ff92-hpf9
Nov 20, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.contrib:xwiki-application-admintools
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 4.4, < 4.5.1

## Patched versions

4.5.1

## Description

### Impact

A cross site request forgery vulnerability in the admin tool for executing shell commands on the server allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands by tricking an admin into loading the URL with the shell command. A very simple possibility for an attack are comments. When the attacker can leave a comment on any page in the wiki it is sufficient to include an image with an URL like `/xwiki/bin/view/Admin/RunShellCommand?command=touch%20/tmp/attacked` in the comment. When an admin views the comment, the file `/tmp/attacked` will be created on the server. The output of the command is also vulnerable to XWiki syntax injection which offers a simple way to execute Groovy in the context of the XWiki installation and thus an even easier way to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the whole XWiki installation.

### Patches

This has been patched by adding a form token check in version 4.5.1 of the admin tools.

### Workarounds

The [patch](https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-admintools/commit/03815c505c9f37006a0c56495e862dc549a39da8) can be applied manually to the affected wiki pages. Alternatively, the document `Admin.RunShellCommand` can also be deleted if the possibility to run shell commands isn't needed.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
