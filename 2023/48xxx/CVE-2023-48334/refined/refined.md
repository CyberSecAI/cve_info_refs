- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress League Table Plugin <= 1.13 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious request that is triggered when a logged-in user visits a malicious website or clicks a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user to perform an action on the vulnerable plugin. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
