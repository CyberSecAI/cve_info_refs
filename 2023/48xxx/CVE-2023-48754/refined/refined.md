- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Delete Post Revisions plugin for WordPress, in versions 4.6 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions. The specific impact varies, as this is a generic description of the vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, would cause the vulnerable plugin to execute unwanted actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a page that contains a forged request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
