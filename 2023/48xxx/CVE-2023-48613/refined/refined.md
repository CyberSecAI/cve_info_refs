The provided document is a security bulletin from Adobe, detailing multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).  CVE-2023-48613 is one of the many vulnerabilities listed and is related to Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS).

Here's the extracted information for CVE-2023-48613:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The application is vulnerable to stored XSS attacks, meaning malicious script can be injected and stored on the server to be executed later by other users.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), the attack complexity is low (AC:L). A low privileged attacker can inject the malicious code via some interface in the application. This requires a user to trigger the execution (UI:R), and the scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C), which means that it will affect other parts of the application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: A low-privileged attacker is required. They need to be able to inject malicious code which is then stored. The victim needs to interact with the stored malicious script to trigger the execution.
