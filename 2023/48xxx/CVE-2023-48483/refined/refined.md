The provided content is related to CVE-2023-48483.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), with a low attack complexity (AC:L). A low privileged attacker with user interaction (PR:L/UI:R) can exploit the stored XSS. The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C) and allows for limited information disclosure and integrity impact.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user and needs to induce a victim user to interact with the malicious payload.
