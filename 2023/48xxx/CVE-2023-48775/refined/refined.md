- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, the absence of proper authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the affected function.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by accessing a function lacking necessary authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber and be able to access the vulnerable function without necessary privileges.
