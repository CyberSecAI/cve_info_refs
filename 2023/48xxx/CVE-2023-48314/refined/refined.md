- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the unescaped passing of the request URL within the `proxy.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly sanitize or encode the request URL before using it, making it vulnerable to exploitation through a proxy.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Users of Nextcloud with the Collabora Online - Built-in CODE Server app can be vulnerable to attacks via the `proxy.php` file. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the `proxy.php` file. The specific method of exploitation, while not explicitly mentioned, would involve crafting a malicious URL that, when processed by `proxy.php`, results in an undesirable outcome due to the lack of proper sanitization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be in a position to send crafted requests to the server, likely via a proxy, and have knowledge of the vulnerability to form the malicious URL.
