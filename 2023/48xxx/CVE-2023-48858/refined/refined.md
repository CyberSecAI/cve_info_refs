Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization within the `login.php` page of Armex ABO.CMS. Specifically, user-supplied input through the URL is not properly escaped or sanitized before being used in the page's HTML output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This occurs when an attacker can inject malicious scripts into a web application, and those scripts are then reflected back to the user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary script execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- **Session hijacking:** By executing JavaScript, an attacker can potentially steal user cookies and hijack their sessions.
- **Phishing:** The injected script could be used to redirect the user to a malicious website designed to steal credentials or other sensitive information.
- **Defacement:** Attackers could alter the appearance of the website viewed by the user.
- **Information theft:** Through JavaScript, attackers could potentially collect information from the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious code into the `login.php` URL. The provided PoC demonstrates this: `http://demo.abocms.ru/login.php/eqbzm%22%3E%3Cimg%20src%3d/%20onerror%3dalert%281%29%3Er338y`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need any special access or privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Publicly accessible:** The vulnerable login page is publicly accessible.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable URL:**  The attacker needs to know the URL where the vulnerability resides (`login.php`).
- **Ability to craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious URL with the XSS payload.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) URL which injects an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event, triggering an alert box. This confirms the presence of XSS vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is not limited to the "demo" version and exists in real-world deployments.
- Multiple versions of the product are likely to be affected (ABO.CMS versions 5.9) due to the use of login.php.
