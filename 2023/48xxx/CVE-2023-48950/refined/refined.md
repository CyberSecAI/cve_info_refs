Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of SQL queries involving `INSERT`, `MAX(DISTINCT)`, and nested `SELECT` statements. The issue appears to reside within the `box_col_len` function, as indicated by the crash backtrace. The crash occurs when processing a specific type of query plan.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core weakness is a bug in the query processing logic, specifically within the `box_col_len` function. This likely involves incorrect handling of intermediate results when processing the nested SQL statements leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is a crash of the Virtuoso server. While the provided information doesn't explicitly state the severity or ability to perform code execution, the crash can lead to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted SQL query that triggers the vulnerable code path within the Virtuoso server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries on the Virtuoso server. This could be a local or a remote attacker depending on the server's configuration. The provided PoC demonstrates the ability to remotely execute arbitrary queries.
- It does not appear that authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

The PoC SQL code is:
```sql
CREATE TABLE v0 ( v1 nvarchar ) ;
INSERT INTO v0 VALUES ( 1 ) ;
INSERT INTO v0 SELECT MAX ( DISTINCT v1 ) FROM v0 ;
INSERT INTO v0 SELECT v1 FROM v0 WHERE ( SELECT ( SELECT v1 FROM v0 ) ) ;
```

The issue is resolved by commit `696600b5634290e7a5d02bf14f39fbce4a592663`.
