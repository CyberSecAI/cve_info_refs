# Broken Access control on Graphs Feature

Moderate

[murrant](/murrant)
published
GHSA-fpq5-4vwm-78x4
Nov 17, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<23.11.0

## Patched versions

23.11.0

## Description

### Summary

This vulnerability occurs when application is not checking access of each type of users as per their role and it autorizing the users to access any feature. When user access his Device dashboard in librenms, one request is going to graph.php to access image of graphs generated on the particular Device. This request can be accessed by lower privileged users as well and they can enumerate devices on librenms with their id or hostname.

### Details

*Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer.*

### PoC

1. Login with Lower privilege user
2. Go to /graph.php?width=150&height=45&device=1&type=device\_ping\_perf&from=1699022192&legend=no&bg=FFFFFF00&popup\_title=ICMP+Response
3. If its showing image with "device\*ping\_perf" which confirms that there is device with id 1
4. Now you can change device parameter in above URL with hostname to check if that Hostname/IP exist or not like

   <http://127.0.0.1:8000/graph.php?width=150&height=45&device=127.0.0.1&type=device_ping_perf&from=1699022192&legend=no&bg=FFFFFF00&popup_title=ICMP+Response>
5. If device hostname doesn't exist then it should show 500 error

Vulnerable code:

<https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/fa93034edd40c130c2ff00667ca2498d84be6e69/html/graph.php#L19C1-L25C2>

Above is vulnerable line of code from Line number 19-25

This is not checking privilege of users to access any device hostname, its just checking if user is authenticated

or not

### Impact

Low privilege users can see all devices registered by admin users by using this method

### Solution

Implement privilege access control feature to check if low privilege user have access or not.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
