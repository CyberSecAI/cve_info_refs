# The Right-Sized CRM Solution for Community Banks and Credit Unions

#### Grow relationships with a CRM built by bankers, for bankers.

[Get Started](https://www.quest-analytics.com/let-s-connect)

Growing your customer base is essential to your future. Without timely information and an actionable plan, it's impossible for your team to deliver.

SALES GROWTH CONCERNS

You've set clear goals, but don't have the tracking data, insights, or guidance to ensure your team is equipped to promote sales.

FRUSTRATED TEAMS

No one can do their best work without crucial customer information. It's impossible to improve when you don't have a clear picture.

xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?

LOST RELATIONSHIPS

Every interaction with a banking customer is an opportunity to deepen the relationship. Without a clear action plan and personalized offers, missed opportunities become lost revenue.

# Your Next Steps

##### Start here. Plan for success.

# 1

#### IDENTIFY YOUR GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

If you've experienced frustration or stress about meeting revenue goals in the past, let's turn our attention to growth opportunities for the future. During our discovery call, we'll get to know your business and what you're working to achieve. Through a customized demo, you'll see what's possible with Quest Analytics.

# 2

The solution is modular. You have flexibility to choose precisely which modules and features match your needs and your budget.

A right-sized banking CRM eliminates technology overspend and empowers your team to achieve your business goals.

#### BUNDLE THE CRM MODULES THAT ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS

# 3

#### LEVERAGE YOUR DATA TO GROW YOUR CUSTOMER BASE

The customer information is all there, but it's only useful when your team can see it and act on it. Quest Analytics will mine rich customer data and present your team with actionable information to help them confidently grow relationships with customers and achieve your business goals.

##### Bankers deserve tools and information at their fingertips to deepen customer relationships, maximize sales opportunities, and reach business goals.

# Focus on Features

## Customer Activity Log

###### IQESSENTIALS

##### Module

Your commercial lender is scheduled to meet with one of your top customers, 34 Bayside LLC, for lunch.

Before the meeting, she checks the CRM activity log. She sees two issues with wire transfers in the past few days. That’s not great news, but customer-focused commercial lenders know you cannot expand relationships with an unhappy customer. The commercial lender will be proactive and discuss the issue resolution before moving on to new business.

First Exchange Bank has implemented the IQ Suite of banking CRM software tools to help us focus on providing personalized service to each customer.

I no longer go into my core banking system.  I use the banking CRM to document and manage all of my customer interactions.

###### Bill Goettel

CEO

First Exchange Bank

Quest Analytics has helped us move from legacy collection software to an intelligent collections system that specifically meets our needs.

Strategically, having this information as a part of our enterprise-wide CRM is brilliant.

###### Karston Cannon

VP of Loan Servicing & Default Manager

First Federal Bank of Florida

We immediately realized the value of the product as Quest had us using the new system in about a week.

In the past, some manual reports took hours to build.

Now we have them completed in just a few seconds.

###### Robert Simper

CFO

SouthStar Bank

InFirst Bank uses the Quest Analytics CRM software to help us focus on providing personalized service to each client.

The solution helps us anticipate life events that have a financial impact so that we can serve and exceed expectations with every interaction.
