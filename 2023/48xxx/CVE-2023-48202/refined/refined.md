Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of SVG files uploaded through the file manager in Sunlight CMS. Specifically, the system does not remove or neutralize JavaScript code embedded within SVG files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS where malicious JavaScript within an SVG file is stored and then executed when a user (like an administrator) views the image through the file manager.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The system fails to sanitize or validate SVG file content, allowing the execution of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with the ability to upload files (e.g., an 'Editor' group member) can use this vulnerability to escalate privileges to higher-level groups, including 'Administrators' or 'Super Administrators'.
- **Complete System Control:** By gaining higher privileges, the attacker can create, edit, and delete content, manipulate user accounts, and potentially access sensitive data (database through the backup functionality).
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated as arbitrary code execution, the attacker could escalate to having that capability with the exploited privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attack vector is through the file upload functionality in the file manager, where a malicious SVG file is uploaded.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user (e.g., an administrator) to interact with the uploaded malicious SVG file by accessing the image through the file manager, which triggers the malicious script embedded in the SVG.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the privilege to upload files within the CMS file manager (e.g., a member of the 'Editors' or 'Moderators' group).
- **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable CMS version and the location of the file upload functionality.
- **Malicious SVG File Creation:** The attacker needs to create a valid SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code designed to escalate privileges.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) code shows how the attacker can exploit the XSS vulnerability to gain admin privileges by modifying the user group membership. The script uses an XMLHttpRequest to first get the security token and then uses another XMLHttpRequest with a POST request to modify the group membership of the attacker's user account.
- The suggested remediation involves sanitizing SVG files by stripping out scripts or converting them into safer image formats.
