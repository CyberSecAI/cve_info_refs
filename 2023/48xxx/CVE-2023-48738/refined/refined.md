- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL Injection
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Porto Theme - Functionality Plugin versions before 2.12.1 are vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows an attacker to directly interact with the database.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially steal information from the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is not explicitly specified, but it is likely via user-supplied input to the plugin that is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
