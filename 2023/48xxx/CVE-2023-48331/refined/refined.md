- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MyBookTable Bookstore plugin for WordPress, versions 3.3.4 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary case by case, but it could include actions such as changing plugin settings, modifying content, or performing other administrative tasks.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious request that exploits the vulnerable plugin. This request could be delivered through various means, such as a link in an email or an injected script on a website. If a logged-in user with sufficient privileges clicks the link or visits the malicious site, their browser will unintentionally send the attacker's forged request to the WordPress server, triggering the unwanted action on behalf of the user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into submitting a crafted malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
