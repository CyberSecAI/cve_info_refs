- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The JetElements For Elementor plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the actions the plugin allows.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to trick a logged-in administrator or another privileged user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need authentication but needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into performing an unwanted action.
