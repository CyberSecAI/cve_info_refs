This document provides information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-48551, affecting Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

**CVE-2023-48551:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS). The application improperly sanitizes user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS (CWE-79).
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute within the browser of other users when they view the affected page.
*  **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack (AV:N), requiring low attack complexity (AC:L). A low-privileged attacker (PR:L) can inject the script and a user must interact with the injected script (UI:R). The vulnerability is exploited when the victim user views the page containing the malicious script, in a different context (S:C)
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the application.

The document provides details for multiple other CVEs as well, all of which are Stored XSS (CWE-79) except for CVE-2023-48441, which is Improper Access Control (CWE-284). The impact of the XSS vulnerabilities is Arbitrary Code Execution. The attack vector and required privileges are consistent with the description above for all XSS vulnerabilities except a few that have higher privilege requirements or no user interaction.

The document also mentions an Improper Access Control vulnerability:
*   **CVE-2023-48441**
    *   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Access Control (CWE-284)
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Access Control
    *   **Impact of exploitation**: Security feature bypass
    *   **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack (AV:N), requiring low attack complexity (AC:L). No privileges needed (PR:N) and no user interaction needed (UI:N). This is an unprivileged, network-based attack (S:U)
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special capabilities are required and anyone on the network can trigger the vulnerability.

The document also mentions that customers using Apache httpd in a proxy with a non-default configuration may be impacted by CVE-2023-25690.
