This document provides information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-48597, affecting Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

**CVE-2023-48597**
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing a malicious script to be stored.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution can occur when a victim views the page containing the stored malicious script.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects the malicious script into a field that is later displayed to a user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script, and a user needs to view the page with the injected script.
