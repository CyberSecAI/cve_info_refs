TAIWAN-CA(TWCA) JCICSecurityTool  fails to check the source website and access locations when executing multiple Registry-related functions. In the scenario where a user is using the JCICSecurityTool and has completed identity verification, if the user browses a malicious webpage created by an attacker, the attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read or modify any registry file under HKEY_CURRENT_USER, thereby achieving remote code execution.
