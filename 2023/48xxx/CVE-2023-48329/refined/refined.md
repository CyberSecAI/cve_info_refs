- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Fast Custom Social Share by CodeBard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the website. This can be achieved through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to insert arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, which will be executed when guests visit the site. This could lead to various malicious activities such as redirecting users to phishing sites, injecting advertisements, or even performing actions on the user's behalf.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin, where it is possible to inject malicious scripts. The exact methods through which the input is injected are not specified here, but it is implied to be through a user-supplied input field or similar.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator privileges on the WordPress site.
