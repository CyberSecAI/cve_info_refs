**CVE-2023-48545**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server and executed when other users access the affected page.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious scripts through a vulnerable input field or similar mechanism, and these scripts are then stored on the server. When another user views the affected content, the injected script is executed in their browser. This is a network-based attack.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires a low privileged account to inject the malicious script and a user must interact with the stored script through their web browser.
