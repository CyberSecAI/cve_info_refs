The provided content includes detailed information about CVE-2023-48720.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of input sanitization of the 'password' parameter in the `login.php` resource before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- Unauthenticated access to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to:
    - Data breaches (access to sensitive data from the database).
    - Data modification or deletion.
    - Potential takeover of the application server by escalating database privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the login.php resource with a malicious value for the `password` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be remote and does not require prior authentication or any specific position to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the server.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet in login.php:
    ```php
    $username=$_POST["userid"];
    $password=$_POST["password"];
    $sql = "SELECT userid FROM admin_login WHERE userid='$username' and password = '$password'";
    $result=mysqli_query($conn,$sql);
    ```
- The advisory also mentions other SQLi vulnerabilities in the same system, specifically CVE-2023-48716, CVE-2023-48718 and CVE-2023-48722.
