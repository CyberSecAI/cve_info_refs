Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `bavideotab` module for PrestaShop versions up to 1.0.5 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `BaVideoTabSaveVideoModuleFrontController::run()` and `BaVideoTabConfirmDeleteModuleFrontController::run()` methods. Specifically, the `id`, `id_product`, and other parameters received via HTTP requests are not sanitized or properly escaped before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The module directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   Lack of Input Validation: The module fails to validate and sanitize input parameters received through HTTP requests before using them in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can obtain sensitive data from the database, including admin credentials, customer data, and other critical information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can gain administrative access to the PrestaShop instance.
*   **Webskimmer Deployment:** The vulnerability is being actively exploited to deploy webskimmers to steal credit card information.
*   **Hijacking Emails:** Attackers can rewrite SMTP settings to take control of emails sent by the system.
*   **Token Exposure:** Attackers can expose tokens and unlock admin's ajax scripts

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via HTTP requests.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the affected module's controllers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges on the system.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attacker does not require any interaction from a user on the system.
*   **Basic Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target PrestaShop instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit can be executed via a simple HTTP call.
*   The module's controller path can be concealed during the exploit, making it difficult to detect in conventional frontend logs.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.6 of the module by casting the vulnerable parameters to integers.

**Proof of Concept:**

The advisory provides example `curl` commands demonstrating how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Patch Information:**

The advisory includes code diffs showing how the vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.6 by casting `id`, `id_product` and other vulnerable parameters to integers, which prevents the SQL injection. Additionally, the `name_shop` parameter was passed through `pSQL()` in one of the queries, which sanitizes the input.
