{
  "CVE-2023-48232": {
    "root_cause": "A floating point exception may occur in the `adjust_plines_for_skipcol()` function of Vim when calculating the line offset for overlong lines with smooth scrolling enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag, which might result in division by zero if the width calculation leads to zero.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper calculation of line offset leading to floating point exception."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability can lead to a crash of Vim.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a file with overlong lines using Vim with smooth scrolling enabled with specific settings ('n' flag included in 'cpo'), and a window border present. An attacker could craft a file with specific formatting to trigger the floating point exception.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to influence the content of a file opened with Vim, and the user needs to have specific non-default settings configured. User interaction is required to open the file with Vim."
