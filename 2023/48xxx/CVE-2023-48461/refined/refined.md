Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-48461:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious scripts into stored content.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser. This could result in unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activity.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a field or area of the application where content is stored. When another user views the stored content, the injected script executes.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit input that is then stored and displayed to other users of the application. This typically requires having an account with the ability to add or modify certain types of content. A low privileged user can perform this attack. The attacker needs to induce a victim to interact with the crafted content, such as by viewing a page or specific resource.
