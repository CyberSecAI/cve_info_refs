Dell PowerProtect DD, versions prior to 7.13.0.10, LTS 7.7.5.25, LTS 7.10.1.15, 6.2.1.110 contain an OS command injection vulnerability in administrator CLI. A remote high privileged attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands on the application's underlying OS to bypass security restriction. Exploitation may lead to a system take over by an attacker.
