- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack (AV:N), with low attack complexity (AC:L), requires a low privileged user (PR:L), user interaction (UI:R), and the scope is changed (S:C).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user and needs to induce a victim to interact with the malicious content.
