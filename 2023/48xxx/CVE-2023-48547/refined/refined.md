The provided content is a security bulletin for Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) that lists multiple CVEs, including CVE-2023-48547.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2023-48547:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Vulnerability Category:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*  **Severity:** Important
*   **CVSS Score:** 5.4
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**Explanation:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability, meaning the malicious script is saved on the server and executed when a user interacts with it.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data, allowing a malicious script to be stored and subsequently executed within the context of a user's browser session.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser. This could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, including stealing cookies, accessing sensitive information, or redirecting the user to a malicious website.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The attacker would need to inject a malicious script into a field that is not properly sanitized.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) and the user needs to be tricked into interacting with the malicious script (UI:R). The scope of impact is changed (S:C), meaning the attack affects a different part of the application. The confidentiality, integrity and availability impact is low, low and none respectively (C:L/I:L/A:N).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bulletin also acknowledges Lorenzo Pirondini for reporting this vulnerability.
*   This is one of many stored XSS vulnerabilities fixed in this bulletin.
