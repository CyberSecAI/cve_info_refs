The provided content is related to CVE-2023-48519.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause of the vulnerability is a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness present is stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which are then stored and executed when a user views the affected content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) and needs to induce a user to interact with the stored malicious content (UI:R). The attack requires the application to reflect the stored data in a different user's browser. The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C) meaning the injected script will be executed in the context of the application.
