- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. The plugin does not sufficiently verify user privileges before allowing access to certain functionalities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user (subscriber) could execute higher privileged actions. The specific impact is case-dependent, but could lead to unauthorized modifications or access to sensitive data, depending on the privileged action that can be performed.
- **Attack vectors:** A low-privileged user (subscriber) could exploit this vulnerability by interacting with the vulnerable function without proper authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user with the role of "subscriber." They do not require any additional privileges beyond that.
