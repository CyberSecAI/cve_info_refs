Nextcloud Mail is the mail app for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Starting in version 1.13.0 and prior to version 2.2.8 and 3.3.0, an attacker can use an unprotected endpoint in the Mail app to perform a SSRF attack. Nextcloud Mail app versions 2.2.8 and 3.3.0 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable the mail app.
