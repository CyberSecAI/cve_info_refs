Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the 'username' parameter in the `/rtbs/admin/index.php` file of the PHPGurukul Restaurant Table Booking System 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. Due to the lack of input sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious SQL queries through the 'username' parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation can bypass authentication mechanisms, granting the attacker unauthorized access to the administrative panel.
* **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/rtbs/admin/index.php` file. The malicious SQL code is injected through the `username` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
* No prior authentication is required as the SQL injection is used to bypass the login.

**Technical Details:**
* The provided PoC uses `sqlmap` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
* The sqlmap command shows how an attacker would use the `--data` parameter to inject SQL code through the username field and dump the content of the `tbladmin` table from the `rtbsdb` database, specifically dumping the `AdminName`, `AdminuserName`, and `Password` columns.
