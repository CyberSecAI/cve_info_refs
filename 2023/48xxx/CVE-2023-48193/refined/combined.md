| [CVE-2023-48193](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48193) Insecure Permissions vulnerability in JumpServer GPLv3 v.3.8.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via bypassing the command filtering function.  JumpServer is an open-source bastion host without a client-side component. It provides basic command filtering based on user input streams. However, when users attempt to execute commands by writing them into files, the filtering mechanism cannot be applied. Therefore, the current CVE description is not valid.  More see: <https://blog.fit2cloud.com/?p=8cf83cd9-c23b-4625-9350-38926fb7f88e>  Thanks for **Christian Fischer** remind us dispute this CVE |

BUG\_Author:
Lcc

Affected version:

JumpServer 社区版 GPLv3
v3.8.0

Vendor:
<https://www.jumpserver.org/>

Software:

<https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/>

Description:
Bypass command filtering in jumpserver rights management. When setting the command filtering function, columns such as eval, ls, or other commands.
Normally, the system blocks authorized users from using these commands. However, if the asset has authorized users to save these filtered commands in a.sh script,
such as eval ls, then execute the.sh script directly. Both commands can be executed. In this way, the command filtering function is bypassed.
Remote commands may be executed in real situations, resulting in system security.
