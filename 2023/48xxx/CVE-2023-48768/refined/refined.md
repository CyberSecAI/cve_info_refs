The provided content relates to CVE-2023-48768.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Quantity Plus Minus Button for WooCommerce" by CodeAstrology, versions 1.1.9 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CSRF:** The plugin lacks proper protection against CSRF attacks, which allows an attacker to force a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
*   The specific impact would vary from case to case, however, the potential exists to perform actions that the user is authorized for.

**Attack vectors:**
*   An attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a webpage hosting malicious code.
*   The attack vector requires a user with active session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request to the vulnerable plugin that they can trick a logged in user into triggering.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target website.
*   The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged in user to perform the malicious action (e.g. via clickjacking or a crafted link).
