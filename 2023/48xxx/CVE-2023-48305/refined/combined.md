# user\_ldap app logs user passwords in the log file on level debug

Moderate

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-35p6-4992-w5fr
Nov 21, 2023

## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

>= 25.0.0, >= 26.0.0, >= 27.0.0

## Patched versions

25.0.11, 26.0.6, 27.1.0

Server
(Nextcloud Enterprise)

>= 25.0.0, >= 26.0.0, >= 27.0.0

25.0.11, 26.0.6, 27.1.0

## Description

### Impact

When the log level was set to debug the user\_ldap app logged user passwords in plaintext into the log file. If the log file was then leaked or shared in any way the users' passwords would be leaked.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 25.0.11, 26.0.6 or 27.1.0

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 25.0.11, 26.0.6 or 27.1.0

### Workarounds

* Change config setting `loglevel` to `1` or higher (should always be higher than 1 in production environments).

### References

* [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/2101165)
* [PullRequest](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/40013)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

## Description

![@Schubisu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3865452?u=c82430cbb25c823cd9b1d768684ac27de38972b0&v=4&size=48)[Schubisu](https://github.com/Schubisu)opened [on May 25, 2023](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/38461#issue-1725776026)
### ⚠️ This issue respects the following points: ⚠️

* This is a **bug**, not a question or a configuration/webserver/proxy issue.
* This issue is **not** already reported on Github *(I've searched it)*.
* Nextcloud Server **is** up to date. See [Maintenance and Release Schedule](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/wiki/Maintenance-and-Release-Schedule) for supported versions.
* Nextcloud Server **is** running on 64bit capable CPU, PHP and OS.
* I agree to follow Nextcloud's [Code of Conduct](https://nextcloud.com/contribute/code-of-conduct/).

### Bug description

The user\_ldap app seems to log all LDAP operations, including parameters, in plain text.

[server/apps/user\_ldap/lib/LDAP.php](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/b6d734375478c791a146e2ec5ad61ac1a699e436/apps/user_ldap/lib/LDAP.php#L320-L324)

Lines 320 to 324
in
[b6d7343](/nextcloud/server/commit/b6d734375478c791a146e2ec5ad61ac1a699e436)

|  | $this->logger->debug('Calling LDAP function {func} with parameters {args}', [ |
| --- | --- |
|  | 'app' => 'user\_ldap', |
|  | 'func' => $functionName, |
|  | 'args' => json\_encode($args), |
|  | ]); |

For the `ldap_bind` command this looks like

```
Calling LDAP function ldap_bind with parameters [{},"<full user DN>", "<plain text password"]

```
### Steps to reproduce

1. configure Nextcloud for LDAP user backend
2. connect external client (in my case Gnome online account)
3. trigger ldap\_bind (e.g. by syncing the calendar in the client)
4. follow the `DEBUG` log

### Expected behavior

If logged, I would expect the line to not display the password, or to omit parameters completely:

```
Calling LDAP function ldap_bind with parameters [{},"<full user DN>", "********"]

```

or

```
Calling LDAP function ldap_bind

```
