- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of HTTP headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: HTTP Tunneling vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass security checks and send HTTP requests to the backend server. This is due to the lack of proper input validation of HTTP headers. This vulnerability is related to an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-41265.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a compromise of the server running the Qlik Sense software, including unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE), and elevation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tunneling HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows server. The attacker can be unauthenticated but needs to have some level of access to send the malicious requests.
