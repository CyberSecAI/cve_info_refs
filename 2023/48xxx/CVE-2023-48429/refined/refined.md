- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Web UI of affected devices does not check the length of parameters in certain conditions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation, specifically the lack of length checks on parameters received by the Web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious admin can crash the server by sending a crafted request to the server. The server will automatically restart, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted requests to the server's Web UI with excessively long parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A malicious admin with access to the Web UI is required to send crafted requests.
