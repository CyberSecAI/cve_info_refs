Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-48304:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks within the CalDAV component of Nextcloud, specifically concerning the birthday calendar feature. This allowed an attacker to enable or disable the birthday calendar for any user on the same Nextcloud server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate access control: The primary weakness is the failure to verify if a user has the right to modify the birthday calendar settings of another user.
- Insufficient authorization checks: The CalDAV component lacked the proper authorization checks to ensure that only the owner of the calendar could modify it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could enable or disable the birthday calendar for any user on the same server.
- While the impact is classified as "Low" in terms of availability by CVSS, this could be used to cause minor inconvenience.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low Privileges: The attacker requires a low privileged account on the Nextcloud instance to carry out the exploit.
- No User Interaction: The exploit can be performed without any interaction from another user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key).
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in pull request #40292 on the Nextcloud server repository, which focused on correctly handling 403 Forbidden responses in the DAV endpoint.
