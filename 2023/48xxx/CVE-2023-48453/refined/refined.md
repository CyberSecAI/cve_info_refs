The provided content is related to CVE-2023-48453.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause for CVE-2023-48453, as well as for a large number of other CVEs listed, is Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS). This occurs when user-provided data is not properly sanitized before being stored and later rendered in a web page, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the stored XSS vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The attacker injects malicious scripts by providing unsanitized data through a vulnerable input vector. The malicious script is then stored and executed when a user views the affected page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L), and the user interaction is required (UI:R), because the victim must view a page that contains the injected script, and the vulnerability scope is changed (S:C) to the targeted web site.

The provided document lists a large number of CVEs that are fixed in the same update of Adobe Experience Manager, and all the listed CVEs have the same XSS root cause and impact, except for CVE-2023-48441 that is caused by an improper access control.
