- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause for all listed vulnerabilities, except CVE-2023-48441, is improper or insufficient sanitization of user input, leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. CVE-2023-48441 is due to improper access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerabilities include numerous instances of Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and an Improper Access Control issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the Stored XSS vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser. Successful exploitation of the Improper Access Control vulnerability can lead to a security feature bypass.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector for all listed Stored XSS vulnerabilities is network-based (AV:N), requiring a low attack complexity (AC:L) and user interaction (UI:R). An attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) for most of the XSS vulnerabilities, except for CVE-2023-48537, CVE-2023-48576, CVE-2023-48579, CVE-2023-48582 and CVE-2023-48584 which require high privileges (PR:H) to exploit.  The Improper Access Control vulnerability (CVE-2023-48441) is also network-based (AV:N) with low complexity (AC:L) and no user interaction (UI:N) with no required privileges (PR:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker requires network access to the AEM application. For most XSS, they need a low privileged account. However, for CVE-2023-48537, CVE-2023-48576, CVE-2023-48579, CVE-2023-48582 and CVE-2023-48584 a high privileged account is needed. For the Improper Access Control issue, no privileges are required. The attacker also needs to induce a user to interact with the crafted malicious data to execute the XSS payload, in all listed XSS vulnerabilities except for CVE-2023-48608, CVE-2023-48582, which does not require user interaction.
