This document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2023-48594.

**CVE-2023-48594**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of user-supplied input which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and later executed within the application.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting). The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-controlled input before storing and displaying it, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled scripts.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the user's browser session. This can lead to sensitive data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. An attacker can inject the malicious script through the application's interface, which is later stored and executed when a user interacts with the affected resource.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to provide input to the vulnerable part of the application and have a user interact with the stored malicious script. In the case of this specific CVE, the attacker must have a low privilege account. User interaction is also required.

The document also includes information for a number of other CVEs, all related to Adobe Experience Manager. These are mainly Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, with one Improper Access Control vulnerability.
