Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-48718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `class_name` parameter in the `add_students.php` resource is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a database query.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate the `class_name` parameter, allowing for arbitrary SQL code to be inserted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Database Compromise:** A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Breach:** The attacker could potentially extract confidential information such as user credentials, personal details, or application-specific data.
- **Application Manipulation:** The attacker could use SQL injection to modify application behavior, bypass authentication, or perform other unauthorized actions.
- **Complete System Takeover:** In severe cases, it might be possible to gain control of the server by exploiting underlying database vulnerabilities through SQLi.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to `add_students.php`, injecting SQL code into the `class_name` parameter.
- **Web Interface:** The attack can be launched through the web interface that provides an interface to add students.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning an attacker does not need to have any valid credentials to exploit it.
- **Basic Web Exploitation Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP requests and basic SQL syntax to craft a malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code snippet from `add_students.php`:
  ```php
  $name=$_POST['student_name'];
  $rno=$_POST['roll_no'];
  if(!isset($_POST['class_name']))
   $class_name=null;
  else
   $class_name=$_POST['class_name'];
  
  // validation
  if (empty($name) or empty($rno) or empty($class_name) or preg_match("/[a-z]/i",$rno) or !preg_match("/^[a-zA-Z ]*$/",$name)) {
   if(empty($name))
   echo '<p class="error">Please enter name</p>';
   if(empty($class_name))
   echo '<p class="error">Please select your class</p>';
   if(empty($rno))
   echo '<p class="error">Please enter your roll number</p>';
   if(preg_match("/[a-z]/i",$rno))
   echo '<p class="error">Please enter valid roll number</p>';
   if (!preg_match("/^[a-zA-Z ]*$/",$name)) {
   echo '<p class="error">No numbers or symbols allowed in name</p>';
              }
      exit();
  }
  
  $sql = "INSERT INTO `students` (`name`, `rno`, `class_name`) VALUES ('$name', '$rno', '$class_name')";
  $result=mysqli_query($conn,$sql);
  ```
- The code takes the `class_name` parameter directly from the POST request without any sanitization and inserts it into an SQL query.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is part of a series of SQL injection vulnerabilities found in the "Student Result Management System v1.0" application, with CVE-2023-48716, CVE-2023-48720, and CVE-2023-48722 being related vulnerabilities in the same application.
