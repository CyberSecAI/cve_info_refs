The root cause of the vulnerability is Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, as described by CWE-79

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks (AV:N).
- Low attack complexity (AC:L).
- The attacker needs to be a privileged user (PR:L), as well as a user interaction (UI:R) is required.
- The scope is changed (S:C), meaning that the vulnerability could impact other parts of the application than just the vulnerable component.
- The confidentiality, integrity and availability impact are Low, Low and None respectively (C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application
- The attacker requires low level privileges to inject the malicious script and also requires user interaction to trigger the payload.
