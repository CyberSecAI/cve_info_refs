    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the `get_number` function of Vim. When using the `z=` command, an attacker can provide a count larger than `MAX_INT`, which leads to an overflow. While this is possible through user interaction, the impact is low since a crash is not guaranteed. This vulnerability can be exploited by user interaction through the `z=` command, using a value greater than `MAX_INT`.",
