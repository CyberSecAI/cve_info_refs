*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to stored XSS (CWE-79). This means that malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the application and executed when a user views the affected content.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can inject malicious code into the application through a network request.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) to inject the malicious payload, and the user must interact with the malicious content by clicking on it (UI:R)
