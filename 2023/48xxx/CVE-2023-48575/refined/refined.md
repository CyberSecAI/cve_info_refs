The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe, detailing multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). CVE-2023-48575 is one of the vulnerabilities addressed in this bulletin.

**CVE-2023-48575 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper sanitization/validation of user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker could execute malicious JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser, leading to various impacts such as session hijacking, data theft, or further malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attack. An attacker injects malicious scripts via AEM, which are then stored and executed when a victim views the affected page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs a low privileged account within AEM to inject the malicious script and then a user with a browser has to view the injected script to be exploited.

**Summary of all vulnerabilities described in the bulletin:**

The bulletin covers a large number of stored XSS vulnerabilities (CWE-79), mostly with a CVSS score of 5.4, all leading to arbitrary code execution, and one improper access control vulnerability (CWE-284) leading to security feature bypass. The specific nature of the vulnerable inputs or components is not detailed, but the consistent CWE and impact information indicates that all the XSS issues stem from similar underlying causes. There are some XSS issues with a CVSS score of 4.x with different impact to C,I, and A, and some require higher privileges.
