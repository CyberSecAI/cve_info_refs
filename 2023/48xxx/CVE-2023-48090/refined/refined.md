The provided content is related to CVE-2023-48090, as it describes a memory leak vulnerability within the GPAC project, specifically in `media_tools/m3u8.c`, which is the root cause for CVE-2023-48090.

Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root Cause:**
- Memory leaks in the `extract_attributes` function within `media_tools/m3u8.c` at lines 329 and 345.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unfreed memory allocated by `calloc` in the `extract_attributes` function when parsing M3U8 playlists.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory leaks can cause program performance degradation, system crashes, or unpredictable behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted M3U8 playlist to GPAC, an attacker can trigger the memory leak. The provided `crash.00.zip` file contains a sample M3U8 file which can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted M3U8 playlist to be parsed by GPAC, which implies the attacker can provide input to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details**
- The issue report provides a code location and sample command to reproduce the crash. It also provides a sample M3U8 file that triggers the issue.
- The issue was reported on Nov 7, 2023, and fixed on Dec 4, 2023.
- The ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output shows a direct leak of 120 bytes and an indirect leak of 11 bytes.
