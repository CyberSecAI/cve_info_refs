The provided content is related to CVE-2023-48536.

**Vulnerability Details:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Important
*  **CVSS Score:** 5.4
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   **Affected Product:** Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
*   **Affected Versions:** AEM Cloud Service (CS) and 6.5.18.0 and earlier versions.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to stored XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is network-based (AV:N).
*   **Complexity:** The attack is low complexity (AC:L)
*  **Privileges Required**: The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L)
*  **User Interaction**: User interaction is required (UI:R).
*   **Scope**: The scope is changed (S:C) which means that an XSS vulnerability in this context can affect other parts of the application or other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have low privileged access to AEM.
*   The attacker would need to inject malicious script into a field or component that is not sanitized, so that it is stored.
*   A user with access to the stored malicious script must then trigger it.
*   Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser.
