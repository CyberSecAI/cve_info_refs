The provided content is related to CVE-2023-48521.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a Stored XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that get stored on the server and executed when a user accesses the affected content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) and requires a low level of privileges (PR:L) to inject the malicious script. User interaction (UI:R) is required for the XSS payload to trigger. The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C), which means the injected script would run in the context of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have a low level of privileges to inject the malicious scripts into the vulnerable application. The attacker also needs to entice a user to interact with the malicious content to trigger the XSS.
