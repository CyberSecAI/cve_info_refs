Root cause of vulnerability: The WordPress WooCommerce Login Redirect plugin (<= 2.2.4) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.

Impact of exploitation: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the plugin's functionality while they are authenticated.

Attack vectors: The attack vector is through a malicious link or website that a logged-in user visits, causing their browser to make unauthorized requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious link/website. No specific privilege is needed for the attacker other than being able to craft and deliver the malicious link or website.
