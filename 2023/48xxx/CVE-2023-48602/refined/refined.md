The provided content is related to CVE-2023-48602.

**Vulnerability Details:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Important
*  **CVSS:** 5.4
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**Root Cause:** The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server.
**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability (CWE-79)
**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could result in arbitrary code execution. An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users when they access the affected resource.
**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can inject malicious scripts through a network request.
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) and requires user interaction(UI:R). A user with low privileges needs to insert malicious scripts. Another user with permissions that can view the stored script will trigger the execution. The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C) meaning the attack affects a different context than the one in which the injection occurred.
