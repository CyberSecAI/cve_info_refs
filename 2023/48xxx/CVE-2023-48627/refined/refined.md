- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-787, Out-of-bounds Write
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors:** The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` indicates the following:
    - Attack Vector (AV): Local (L) - The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the vulnerable system.
    - Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L) - The attack is easily performed.
    - Privileges Required (PR): None (N) - The attacker does not need any privileges to perform the attack
    - User Interaction (UI): Required (R) - User interaction is required for the vulnerability to be exploited.
    - Scope (S): Unchanged (U) - The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority.
    - Confidentiality Impact (C): High (H) - There is a high impact on confidentiality of the system
    - Integrity Impact (I): High (H) - There is a high impact on integrity of the system
    - Availability Impact (A): High (H) - There is a high impact on availability of the system
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the system, user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker does not need special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

The document provides more detail than the basic CVE description by specifying the vulnerability type (out-of-bounds write) and providing the CVSS vector string. It also indicates that the vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution and requires user interaction.
