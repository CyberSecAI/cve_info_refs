The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe that lists multiple CVEs, including CVE-2023-48512.

**CVE-2023-48512:**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The software is vulnerable to Stored XSS, where malicious scripts can be injected and stored persistently in the application.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user's browser session.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), with a low attack complexity (AC:L), requiring a low privilege user (PR:L) to inject the script. User interaction is required for the payload to trigger (UI:R). The scope is changed(S:C), meaning the vulnerability affects other parts of the application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious script into a vulnerable field of the Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) and the victim must interact with the injected payload. This implies the attacker needs an account with low privileges.
