## Product detail ⌗

Affected product: Grocy

Affected version: 4.0.3

Affected component: api/stock/products

A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the 'product description' component within '/api/stock/products' of Grocy version <= 4.0.3 allows attackers to obtain a victim's cookies.

Installed Grocy version 4.0.3

---

## Exploitation [⌗](#proof-of-concept)

1. Go to Manage master data

2. Select products

3. Add new product

4. Insert malicious script in the description

As you can see in the gif below:

![](https://nitipoom-jar.github.io/CVE-2023-48198/3.gif)

## Community contributions

See the website for a list of community contributed Add-ons / Tools. → <https://grocy.info/addons>

## How to install

> Checkout [Grocy Desktop](https://github.com/grocy/grocy-desktop), if you want to run Grocy without having to manage a webserver just like a normal (Windows) desktop application.
>
> Directly download the [latest release](https://releases.grocy.info/latest-desktop) - the installation is nothing more than just clicking 2 times "next".

Grocy is technically a pretty simple PHP application, so the basic notes to get it running are:

* Unpack the [latest release](https://releases.grocy.info/latest)
* Copy `config-dist.php` to `data/config.php` + edit to your needs
* Ensure that the `data` directory is writable
* The webserver root should point to the `public` directory
* Include `try_files $uri /index.php$is_args$query_string;` in your location block if you use nginx
  + Or disable URL rewriting (see the option `DISABLE_URL_REWRITING` in `data/config.php`)
* → Default login is user `admin` with password `admin`, please change the password immediately (user menu at the top right corner)

Alternatively clone this repository (the `release` branch always references the latest released version) and install Composer and Yarn dependencies manually.

See the website for more installation guides and troubleshooting help. → <https://grocy.info/links>

### Platform support

* PHP 8.2 or 8.3 (with SQLite 3.34.0+)
  + Required PHP extensions: `fileinfo`, `pdo_sqlite`, `gd`, `ctype`, `intl`, `zlib`, `mbstring`
  + *Recommendation: Benchmark tests showed that e.g. unit conversion handling is up to 5 times faster when using a more recent (3.39.4+) SQLite version.*
* Recent Firefox, Chrome or Edge

## How to run using Docker

See [grocy/grocy-docker](https://github.com/grocy/grocy-docker) or [linuxserver/docker-grocy](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-grocy) for instructions.

## How to update

* Overwrite everything with the [latest release](https://releases.grocy.info/latest) while keeping the `data` directory
* Check `config-dist.php` for new configuration options and add them to your `data/config.php` where appropriate (the default values from `config-dist.php` will be used for not in `data/config.php` defined settings)

If you run Grocy on Linux, there is also `update.sh` (remember to make the script executable (`chmod +x update.sh`) and ensure that you have `unzip` installed) which does exactly this and additionally creates a backup (`.tgz` archive) of the current installation in `data/backups` (backups older than 60 days will be deleted during the update).

## Localization

Grocy is fully localizable - the default language is English (integrated into code), a German localization is always maintained by me.

You can easily help translating Grocy on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/grocy/grocy/dashboard/) if your language is incomplete or not available yet.

The default language can be set in `data/config.php`, e. g. `Setting('DEFAULT_LOCALE', 'it');` and there is also a user setting (see the user settings page) to set a different language per user.

The [pre-release demo](https://demo-prerelease.grocy.info) is available for any translation which is at least 70 % complete and will pull the translations from Transifex 10 minutes past every hour, so you can have a kind of instant preview of your contributed translations. Thank you!

Also any translation which once reached a completion level of 70 % ([`strings` resource](https://www.transifex.com/grocy/grocy/strings/)) will be included in releases.

*RTL languages are unfortunately not yet supported.*

## Motivation

A household needs to be managed. Before Grocy I did this (for almost 10 years) using my first self written software (a C# Windows forms application) and with a bunch of Excel sheets. The software was a pain to use at the end and Excel is Excel. So I searched for and tried different things for a (very) long time, nothing 100 % fitted, so this is my aim for a "complete household management"-thing. ERP your fridge!

## Things worth to know

### REST API

See the integrated Swagger UI instance on [/api](https://demo.grocy.info/api).

The web frontend uses exactly this API for pretty much everything. So everything you can do there is also possible via the API.

### Barcode readers & camera scanning

Some fields (with a barcode icon above) also allow to select a value by scanning a barcode. It works best when your barcode reader prefixes every barcode with a letter which is normally not part of a item name (I use a `$`) and sends a `TAB` after a scan.

Additionally it's also possible to use your device camera to scan a barcode by using the camera button on the right side of the corresponding field (powered by [Quagga2](https://github.com/ericblade/quagga2), totally offline / client-side camera stream processing, please note due to browser security restrictions, this only works when serving Grocy via a secure connection (`https://`)). Quick video demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5YH6IJFnfc>

*My personal recommendation: Use a USB barcode laser scanner. They are cheap and work 1000 % better, faster, under any lighting condition and from any angle.*

### Input shorthands for date fields

For (productivity) reasons all date (and time) input (and display) fields use the ISO-8601 format regardless of localization.
The following shorthands are available:

* `MMDD` gets expanded to the given day on the current year, if > today, or to the given day next year, if < today, in proper notation
  + Example: `0517` will be converted to `2024-05-17`
* `YYYYMMDD` gets expanded to the proper ISO-8601 notation
  + Example: `20240417` will be converted to `2024-04-17`
* `YYYYMMe` or `YYYYMM+` gets expanded to the end of the given month in the given year in proper notation
  + Example: `202407e` will be converted to `2024-07-31`
* `[+/-]n[d/m/y]` gets expanded to a date relative to today, while adding (**+**) or subtracting (**-**) the **n**umber of **d**ays/**m**onths/**y**ears, in proper notation
  + Example: `+1m` will be converted to the same day next month
* `x` gets expanded to `2999-12-31` (which is an alias for "never overdue")
* Down/up arrow keys will increase/decrease the date by 1 day
* Right/left arrow keys will increase/decrease the date by 1 week
* Shift + down/up arrow keys will increase/decrease the date by 1 month
* Shift + right/left arrow keys will increase/decrease the date by 1 year

### Keyboard shorthands for buttons

Wherever a button contains a bold highlighted letter, this is a shortcut key.
Example: Button "**P** Add as new product" can be "pressed" by using the `P` key on your keyboard.

### Barcode lookup via external services

Products can be directly added to the database via looking them up against external services by a barcode.

This can be done in-place using the product picker workflow "External barcode lookup" (the workflow dialog is displayed when entering something unknown in any product input field).

A plugin for [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) is included and used by default (see the `data/config.php` option `STOCK_BARCODE_LOOKUP_PLUGIN`).

See that plugin or `plugins/DemoBarcodeLookupPlugin.php` for a commented example implementation if you want to build a plugin.

### Database migrations

Database schema migration is done when visiting the root (`/`) route (click on the logo in the left upper edge) as needed and is also triggered automatically if the version has changed (so when an update has been made).

*Please note: Database migrations are supposed to work between releases, not between every commit. If you want to run the current `master` branch (which is the development version), you need to handle that (and more) yourself.*

### Disable certain features

If you don't use certain feature sets of Grocy (for example if you don't need "Chores"), there are feature flags per major feature set to hide/disable the related UI elements (see `config-dist.php`).

### Adding your own CSS or JS without to have to modify the application itself

* When the file `data/custom_js.html` exists, the contents of the file will be added just before `</body>` (end of body) on every page
* When the file `data/custom_css.html` exists, the contents of the file will be added just before `</head>` (end of head) on every page

### Demo mode

When the `MODE` setting is set to `dev`, `demo` or `prerelease`, the application will work in a demo mode which means authentication is disabled and some demo data will be generated during the database schema migration (pass the query parameter `nodemodata`, e.g. `https://grocy.example.com/?nodemodata` to skip that).

### Embedded mode

When the file `embedded.txt` exists, it must contain a valid and writable path which will be used as the data directory instead of `data` and authentication will be disabled (used in [Grocy Desktop](https://github.com/grocy/grocy-desktop)).

In embedded mode, settings can be overridden by text files in `data/settingoverrides`, the file name must be `<SettingName>.txt` (e. g. `BASE_URL.txt`) and the content must be the setting value (normally one single line).

## Contributing / Say Thanks

Any help is welcome, feel free to contribute anything which comes to your mind or see <https://grocy.info/#say-thanks> if you just want to say thanks.

## Roadmap

There is none. The progress of a specific bug/enhancement is always tracked in the corresponding issue, at least by commit comment references.

[Milestones](https://github.com/grocy/grocy/milestones) are used to indicate in which version the corresponding request was done (`vNEXT` means it's currently planned to do that for the next release).

## How to start

You can download the theme manually by going to <https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git> and pasting it to `themes/terminal` in your root directory.

You can also choose **one of the 3 possibilities** to install the theme:

1. as Hugo Module
2. as a standalone local directory
3. as a git submodule

⚠️ The theme needs at least Hugo **Extended** v0.90.x.

### Install theme as Hugo Module

```
# If this is the first time you're using Hugo Modules
# in your project. You have to initiate your own module before
# you fetch the theme module.
#
# hugo mod init [your website/module name]
hugo mod get github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/v4
```

and in your config file add:

```
[module]
  # this is needed when you fetch the theme as a submodule to your repo.
  # replacements = "github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/4 -> themes/terminal"
[[module.imports]]
  path = 'github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/v4'
```

Keep in mind that the theme by default won't show up in the `themes` directory. This means that you are using the theme as it was on the repository at the moment you fetched it. Your local `go.sum` file keeps all the references. Read more about Hugo Modules in the [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/).

### Install theme locally

```
git clone https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git themes/terminal
```

This will clone the repository directly to the `themes/terminal` directory.

### Install theme as a submodule

```
git submodule add -f https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git themes/terminal
```

This will install the repository as a sumbodule in the `themes/terminal` directory.

⚠️ If you encounter any issues with:

```
Error: module "terminal" not found; either add it as a Hugo Module or store it in "[...your custom path]/themes".: module does not exist
```

then please try to remove `theme = "terminal"` from your config file.

## How to run your site

```
hugo server -t terminal
```

and go to `localhost:1313` in your browser. From now on all the changes you make will go live, so you don't need to refresh your browser every single time.

## How to configure

The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration. Just copy:

```
baseurl = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
# Add it only if you keep the theme in the `themes` directory.
# Remove it if you use the theme as a remote Hugo Module.
theme = "terminal"
pagination.pagerSize = 5

[params]
  # dir name of your main content (default is `content/posts`).
  # the list of set content will show up on your index page (baseurl).
  contentTypeName = "posts"

  # if you set this to 0, only submenu trigger will be visible
  showMenuItems = 2

  # show selector to switch language
  showLanguageSelector = false

  # set theme to full screen width
  fullWidthTheme = false

  # center theme with default width
  centerTheme = false

  # if your resource directory contains an image called `cover.(jpg|png|webp)`,
  # then the file will be used as a cover automatically.
  # With this option you don't have to put the `cover` param in a front-matter.
  autoCover = true

  # set post to show the last updated
  # If you use git, you can set `enableGitInfo` to `true` and then post will automatically get the last updated
  showLastUpdated = false

  # Provide a string as a prefix for the last update date. By default, it looks like this: 2020-xx-xx [Updated: 2020-xx-xx] :: Author
  # updatedDatePrefix = "Updated"

  # whether to show a page's estimated reading time
  # readingTime = false # default

  # whether to show a table of contents
  # can be overridden in a page's front-matter
  # Toc = false # default

  # set title for the table of contents
  # can be overridden in a page's front-matter
  # TocTitle = "Table of Contents" # default

  # Set date/time format for posts
  # This will impact the date/time displayed on
  # index.html, the posts list page, and on posts themselves
  # This value can also be configured per-post on front matter
  # If you have any issues with the timezone rendering differently
  # than you expected, please ensure your timezone is correctly set
  # on your server.
  # This value can be customized according to Hugo documentation:
  # https://gohugo.io/functions/time/format/
  # Default value (no changes needed):
  # dateFormat = "2006-01-02"
  # Example format, with date, time, and timezone abbreviation:
  # dateFormat = "2006-01-02 3:04:06 PM MST"

[params.twitter]
  # set Twitter handles for Twitter cards
  # see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started#card-and-content-attribution
  # do not include @
  creator = ""
  site = ""

[languages]
  [languages.en]
    languageName = "English"
    title = "Terminal"

    [languages.en.params]
      subtitle = "A simple, retro theme for Hugo"
      owner = ""
      keywords = ""
      copyright = ""
      menuMore = "Show more"
      readMore = "Read more"
      readOtherPosts = "Read other posts"
      newerPosts = "Newer posts"
      olderPosts = "Older posts"
      missingContentMessage = "Page not found..."
      missingBackButtonLabel = "Back to home page"
      minuteReadingTime = "min read"
      words = "words"

      [languages.en.params.logo]
        logoText = "Terminal"
        logoHomeLink = "/"

      [languages.en.menu]
        [[languages.en.menu.main]]
          identifier = "about"
          name = "About"
          url = "/about"
        [[languages.en.menu.main]]
          identifier = "showcase"
          name = "Showcase"
          url = "/showcase"

[module]
  # In case you would like to make changes to the theme and keep it locally in you repository,
  # uncomment the line below (and correct the local path if necessary).
  # --
  # replacements = "github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/v4 -> themes/terminal"
[[module.imports]]
  path = 'github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/v4'
```

**NOTE:** Please keep in mind that currently `main menu` doesn't support nesting.

## Post archetype

See the default `post` file params supported by the theme — <https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/archetypes/posts.md>

## Add-ons

* **Comments** — for adding comments to your blog posts please take a look at `layouts/partials/comments.html` <https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/layouts/partials/comments.html>.
* **Extended Head** — please take a look at `layouts/partials/extended_head.html` <https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/layouts/partials/extended_head.html>
* **Extended Footer** — please take a look at `layouts/partials/extended_footer.html` <https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/layouts/partials/extended_footer.html>

## How to edit the theme

If you are using as a remote Hugo Module (you don't have the theme files in the `theme/terminal`) and you have to override only some of the styles, you can do this easily by adding `static/style.css` in your root directory and point things you want to change.

If you have the theme files in the theme directory, then you can directly edit anything in the theme, you just have to go to `themes/terminal` and modify the files. No compilation step needed.

## Found a bug?

If you spot any bugs, please use [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/issues) or create a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/pulls) to fix the issue.

## New cool idea or feature?

The theme is in constant development since 2019 and has got many cool features that helped many of you and made the theme better. But there were also many features that I wasn't sure about because I want to keep the theme as simple as possible.

So, let's say you have an idea of how to extend the theme. That's cool and you're welcome to do that, just follow these steps:

* fork the theme
* implement the feature
* write an instruction how to use the feature
* give a working example of the implementation for other users
* add info about your work to `COMMUNITY-FEATURES.md`
* make a PR with edited `COMMUNITY-FEATURES.md`

This will help keeping the theme close to its roots, and also allow anyone who wishes to improve it and match their needs, to do whatever they want.

Sounds OK? Cool, let's rock! 🤘

## Community contributions

See the website for a list of community contributed Add-ons / Tools. → <https://grocy.info/addons>

## How to install

> Checkout [Grocy Desktop](https://github.com/grocy/grocy-desktop), if you want to run Grocy without having to manage a webserver just like a normal (Windows) desktop application.
>
> Directly download the [latest release](https://releases.grocy.info/latest-desktop) - the installation is nothing more than just clicking 2 times "next".

Grocy is technically a pretty simple PHP application, so the basic notes to get it running are:

* Unpack the [latest release](https://releases.grocy.info/latest)
* Copy `config-dist.php` to `data/config.php` + edit to your needs
* Ensure that the `data` directory is writable
* The webserver root should point to the `public` directory
* Include `try_files $uri /index.php$is_args$query_string;` in your location block if you use nginx
  + Or disable URL rewriting (see the option `DISABLE_URL_REWRITING` in `data/config.php`)
* → Default login is user `admin` with password `admin`, please change the password immediately (user menu at the top right corner)

Alternatively clone this repository (the `release` branch always references the latest released version) and install Composer and Yarn dependencies manually.

See the website for more installation guides and troubleshooting help. → <https://grocy.info/links>

### Platform support

* PHP 8.2 or 8.3 (with SQLite 3.34.0+)
  + Required PHP extensions: `fileinfo`, `pdo_sqlite`, `gd`, `ctype`, `intl`, `zlib`, `mbstring`
  + *Recommendation: Benchmark tests showed that e.g. unit conversion handling is up to 5 times faster when using a more recent (3.39.4+) SQLite version.*
* Recent Firefox, Chrome or Edge

## How to run using Docker

See [grocy/grocy-docker](https://github.com/grocy/grocy-docker) or [linuxserver/docker-grocy](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-grocy) for instructions.

## How to update

* Overwrite everything with the [latest release](https://releases.grocy.info/latest) while keeping the `data` directory
* Check `config-dist.php` for new configuration options and add them to your `data/config.php` where appropriate (the default values from `config-dist.php` will be used for not in `data/config.php` defined settings)

If you run Grocy on Linux, there is also `update.sh` (remember to make the script executable (`chmod +x update.sh`) and ensure that you have `unzip` installed) which does exactly this and additionally creates a backup (`.tgz` archive) of the current installation in `data/backups` (backups older than 60 days will be deleted during the update).

## Localization

Grocy is fully localizable - the default language is English (integrated into code), a German localization is always maintained by me.

You can easily help translating Grocy on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/grocy/grocy/dashboard/) if your language is incomplete or not available yet.

The default language can be set in `data/config.php`, e. g. `Setting('DEFAULT_LOCALE', 'it');` and there is also a user setting (see the user settings page) to set a different language per user.

The [pre-release demo](https://demo-prerelease.grocy.info) is available for any translation which is at least 70 % complete and will pull the translations from Transifex 10 minutes past every hour, so you can have a kind of instant preview of your contributed translations. Thank you!

Also any translation which once reached a completion level of 70 % ([`strings` resource](https://www.transifex.com/grocy/grocy/strings/)) will be included in releases.

*RTL languages are unfortunately not yet supported.*

## Motivation

A household needs to be managed. Before Grocy I did this (for almost 10 years) using my first self written software (a C# Windows forms application) and with a bunch of Excel sheets. The software was a pain to use at the end and Excel is Excel. So I searched for and tried different things for a (very) long time, nothing 100 % fitted, so this is my aim for a "complete household management"-thing. ERP your fridge!

## Things worth to know

### REST API

See the integrated Swagger UI instance on [/api](https://demo.grocy.info/api).

The web frontend uses exactly this API for pretty much everything. So everything you can do there is also possible via the API.

### Barcode readers & camera scanning

Some fields (with a barcode icon above) also allow to select a value by scanning a barcode. It works best when your barcode reader prefixes every barcode with a letter which is normally not part of a item name (I use a `$`) and sends a `TAB` after a scan.

Additionally it's also possible to use your device camera to scan a barcode by using the camera button on the right side of the corresponding field (powered by [Quagga2](https://github.com/ericblade/quagga2), totally offline / client-side camera stream processing, please note due to browser security restrictions, this only works when serving Grocy via a secure connection (`https://`)). Quick video demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5YH6IJFnfc>

*My personal recommendation: Use a USB barcode laser scanner. They are cheap and work 1000 % better, faster, under any lighting condition and from any angle.*

### Input shorthands for date fields

For (productivity) reasons all date (and time) input (and display) fields use the ISO-8601 format regardless of localization.
The following shorthands are available:

* `MMDD` gets expanded to the given day on the current year, if > today, or to the given day next year, if < today, in proper notation
  + Example: `0517` will be converted to `2024-05-17`
* `YYYYMMDD` gets expanded to the proper ISO-8601 notation
  + Example: `20240417` will be converted to `2024-04-17`
* `YYYYMMe` or `YYYYMM+` gets expanded to the end of the given month in the given year in proper notation
  + Example: `202407e` will be converted to `2024-07-31`
* `[+/-]n[d/m/y]` gets expanded to a date relative to today, while adding (**+**) or subtracting (**-**) the **n**umber of **d**ays/**m**onths/**y**ears, in proper notation
  + Example: `+1m` will be converted to the same day next month
* `x` gets expanded to `2999-12-31` (which is an alias for "never overdue")
* Down/up arrow keys will increase/decrease the date by 1 day
* Right/left arrow keys will increase/decrease the date by 1 week
* Shift + down/up arrow keys will increase/decrease the date by 1 month
* Shift + right/left arrow keys will increase/decrease the date by 1 year

### Keyboard shorthands for buttons

Wherever a button contains a bold highlighted letter, this is a shortcut key.
Example: Button "**P** Add as new product" can be "pressed" by using the `P` key on your keyboard.

### Barcode lookup via external services

Products can be directly added to the database via looking them up against external services by a barcode.

This can be done in-place using the product picker workflow "External barcode lookup" (the workflow dialog is displayed when entering something unknown in any product input field).

A plugin for [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) is included and used by default (see the `data/config.php` option `STOCK_BARCODE_LOOKUP_PLUGIN`).

See that plugin or `plugins/DemoBarcodeLookupPlugin.php` for a commented example implementation if you want to build a plugin.

### Database migrations

Database schema migration is done when visiting the root (`/`) route (click on the logo in the left upper edge) as needed and is also triggered automatically if the version has changed (so when an update has been made).

*Please note: Database migrations are supposed to work between releases, not between every commit. If you want to run the current `master` branch (which is the development version), you need to handle that (and more) yourself.*

### Disable certain features

If you don't use certain feature sets of Grocy (for example if you don't need "Chores"), there are feature flags per major feature set to hide/disable the related UI elements (see `config-dist.php`).

### Adding your own CSS or JS without to have to modify the application itself

* When the file `data/custom_js.html` exists, the contents of the file will be added just before `</body>` (end of body) on every page
* When the file `data/custom_css.html` exists, the contents of the file will be added just before `</head>` (end of head) on every page

### Demo mode

When the `MODE` setting is set to `dev`, `demo` or `prerelease`, the application will work in a demo mode which means authentication is disabled and some demo data will be generated during the database schema migration (pass the query parameter `nodemodata`, e.g. `https://grocy.example.com/?nodemodata` to skip that).

### Embedded mode

When the file `embedded.txt` exists, it must contain a valid and writable path which will be used as the data directory instead of `data` and authentication will be disabled (used in [Grocy Desktop](https://github.com/grocy/grocy-desktop)).

In embedded mode, settings can be overridden by text files in `data/settingoverrides`, the file name must be `<SettingName>.txt` (e. g. `BASE_URL.txt`) and the content must be the setting value (normally one single line).

## Contributing / Say Thanks

Any help is welcome, feel free to contribute anything which comes to your mind or see <https://grocy.info/#say-thanks> if you just want to say thanks.

## Roadmap

There is none. The progress of a specific bug/enhancement is always tracked in the corresponding issue, at least by commit comment references.

[Milestones](https://github.com/grocy/grocy/milestones) are used to indicate in which version the corresponding request was done (`vNEXT` means it's currently planned to do that for the next release).

## The world’s fastest framework for building websites

Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

[Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start/)

![icon depicting Blistering Speed](/images/icon-fast.svg)

### Blistering Speed

What's modern about waiting for your site to build?

Hugo is the fastest tool of its kind. At <1 ms per page, the average site builds in less than a second.

![icon depicting Robust Content Management](/images/icon-content-management.svg)

### Robust Content Management

Flexibility rules. Hugo is a content strategist's dream.

Hugo supports unlimited content types, taxonomies, menus, dynamic API-driven content, and more, all without plugins.

![icon depicting Shortcodes](/images/icon-shortcodes.svg)

### Shortcodes

Hugo's shortcodes are Markdown's hidden superpower.

We love the beautiful simplicity of Markdown’s syntax, but there are times when we want more flexibility. Hugo shortcodes allow for both beauty and flexibility.

![icon depicting Built-in Templates](/images/icon-built-in-templates.svg)

### Built-in Templates

Hugo has common patterns to get your work done quickly.

Hugo ships with pre-made templates to make quick work of SEO, commenting, analytics and other functions. One line of code, and you're done.

![icon depicting Multilingual and i18n](/images/icon-multilingual2.svg)

### Multilingual and i18n

Polyglot baked in.

Hugo provides full i18n support for multi-language sites with the same straightforward development experience Hugo users love in single-language sites.

![icon depicting Custom Outputs](/images/icon-custom-outputs.svg)

### Custom Outputs

HTML not enough?

Hugo allows you to output your content in multiple formats, including JSON or AMP, and makes it easy to create your own.

### 300+ Themes

Hugo provides a robust theming system that is easy to implement but capable of producing even the most complicated websites.

[Check out the Hugo themes.](https://themes.gohugo.io/)

![image depicting an example of Capable Templating](/images/home-page-templating-example.png)

### Capable Templating

Hugo's Go-based templating provides just the right amount of logic to build anything from the simple to complex.

[Get Started.](https://gohugo.io/templates/)

Hugo works on macOS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and others.
