The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe, which lists multiple CVEs related to Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

**CVE-2023-48549 Specific Details:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*  **Severity:** Important
*   **CVSS Score:** 5.4
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   **Attack vector:** Network
*   **Attacker position:** Requires a low privileged user that can trigger a stored XSS. The user must also have another user interact with the stored XSS for the code to execute.

**General Vulnerability Information (Applicable to most CVEs listed):**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause for the vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input sanitization, which allows malicious scripts to be stored and later executed in a user's browser.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **Improper Access Control:** Allows for security feature bypass.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could execute code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to data theft, account takeover, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Security Feature Bypass:** Attackers could bypass security measures put in place on the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network-based:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Low privileged user:**  For stored XSS vulnerabilities, the attacker must have an account that can write data into the application.
    *   **User Interaction:** For stored XSS to work, another user must interact with the page containing the XSS payload.

**Affected Product Versions:**

*   Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Cloud Service (CS) - All
*   AEM 6.5.18.0 and earlier versions - All

**Solution:**

*   Update to AEM Cloud Service Release 2023.11 or later
