Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-48457:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2023-48457
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)
*  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Important
*   **CVSS Score:** 5.4
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. The application improperly sanitizes user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored and executed in the context of other users' browsers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a stored XSS flaw. This allows an attacker to permanently inject malicious scripts into the system. The injected scripts are then executed by other users when they access the affected resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the victim's browser. This can be used to steal sensitive information (session cookies, authentication tokens, etc.), redirect users to malicious websites, perform actions on the user's behalf, or even compromise the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), indicating that an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low (AC:L), implying that the vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit.
*   **Low Privileges Required:** An attacker with low privileges (PR:L) can perform the attack.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning that a user needs to perform an action (e.g., click on a link or view a page) for the exploit to be successful.
*   **Scope Change:** The scope is changed (S:C), because the XSS vulnerability is stored and can affect other users.
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** Low (C:L).
*   **Integrity Impact:** Low (I:L).
*   **Availability Impact:** None (A:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid user account or low level privileges (PR:L) to be able to inject malicious code into the vulnerable component.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same local network as the victim.

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-48457 is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in Adobe Experience Manager. A low-privileged attacker can inject malicious scripts, leading to arbitrary code execution in other users' browsers, and potentially gaining access to sensitive information or compromising user accounts. The exploit requires user interaction to trigger the execution of the malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided document lists a large number of similar XSS vulnerabilities, indicating that the Adobe Experience Manager software has several places where user input is not properly handled, leading to these vulnerabilities.
