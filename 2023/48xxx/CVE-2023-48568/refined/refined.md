The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe that details multiple vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). CVE-2023-48568 is one of the listed vulnerabilities.

**CVE-2023-48568**
  - **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
  - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored within the application and executed when other users interact with the affected content.
  - **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser.
  - **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
  - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to inject malicious scripts via application functionality. A low privilege account is required. The user interaction (victim viewing the injected script) is also needed for successful exploitation.
