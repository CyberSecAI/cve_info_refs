- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the parameter checking mechanism within Azure RTOS ThreadX. This lack of proper validation allows for arbitrary read and write operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper parameter validation leading to arbitrary memory read/write access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary read and write capabilities, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs local access to the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs low privileges on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.
