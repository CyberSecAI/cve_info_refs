{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious request that targets a vulnerable endpoint in the plugin. This request is then triggered when a logged-in user visits a malicious website or opens a malicious link.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to interact with a malicious request. This could be done via social engineering or exploiting other vulnerabilities."
