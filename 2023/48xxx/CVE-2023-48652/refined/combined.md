**Improvements?**

Let us know
[by posting here](https://forums.concretecms.org/c/documentation/24).

## Behavioral Improvements

* Renamed Twitter to “X” in the social networking and social sharing services.
* Health: add a link from reports to the "Start a New Report" page (thanks mlocati)
* Logs with long paths in their messages no longer display beneath the Dashboard panel in the Logs report.
* Packages are now alphabetically sorted in the Dashboard listing interface (thanks JohnTheFish)

* Translate package name in update message (thanks JohnTheFish)

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed error when saving a layout preset under PHP 8.
* Fixed importing IP access log channels (thanks mlocati)
* Fixed issue when importing trees and tree nodes when used with custom classes in packages.
* Fixed: we export three custom styles for blocks and areas that we don’t import (thanks mlocati)
* Fixed bug where if a file folder was added as a favorited and then deleted in the file manager the user would receive errors when using the file chooser.
* Fixed weird behavior when using the content exporter to export pages with scrapbook pasted blocks in them (thanks mlocati)
* Fixed importing RSS displayer blocks under certain conditions from CIF XML (thanks mlocati)

* We now accept boolean-like values when importing booleans from CIF XML files (thanks mlocati)

## Security Fixes

This does not affect versions below 9. Thanks Veshraj Ghimire for reporting.
* Fixed [CVE-2023-48651](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48651) by updating Update Dialog endpoints to only accept Post requests with tokens included with [commit 11764](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/11764/commits/747d5bf776cc81c708f5d8f0d64a1e7eafb3f218) Prior to fix Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) to delete files vulnerability is present at /ccm/system/dialogs/file/delete/1/submit.

Prior to fix, an attacker can force an admin to delete events on the site because the event ID is numeric and sequential. The Concrete CMS Security team scored this 4.3 with CVSS v3 vector [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N&version=3.1) Thanks Veshraj Ghimire for reporting.
