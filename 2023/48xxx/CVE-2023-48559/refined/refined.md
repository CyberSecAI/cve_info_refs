**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

**Weaknesses:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored and executed when other users access the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of another user's browser session. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or further malicious actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
* A network connection to the AEM instance
* A user account with low privileges to inject the malicious script
* The attacker also needs to have a victim user interact with the injected script for it to execute.
