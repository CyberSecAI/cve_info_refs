Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection located in the `staff_act.php` file within the SLiMS (Senayan Library Management System) application.
*   The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input via the `$_GET` parameters `startDate` and `untilDate`. These parameters are directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly uses the values of the `startDate` and `untilDate` GET parameters within an SQL query without sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Access:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:**  Retrieval of sensitive information stored in the database (e.g., user credentials, personal information).
    *   **Data Modification:** Modification of existing data.
    *   **Data Deletion:** Deletion of database records.
    *   **Denial of Service:** The database server could be overloaded, leading to service disruption.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has sufficient privileges, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges and gain control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to the `staff_act.php` file. Specifically, manipulating the `startDate` and `untilDate` parameters with malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application server.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged in as admin or user that has access to Staff Activity Reporting.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** A basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is needed.
*   **Request Interception Tools:** Tools like Burp Suite are useful to intercept and modify the HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Location:** `admin/modules/reporting/customs/staff_act.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** `startDate` and `untilDate` (via HTTP GET request).
*   **SQL Code Example:** The provided example shows the vulnerable code block where the GET parameters are directly used to construct the SQL query without any sanitization, and the sqlmap command to exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content includes a detailed description of how to reproduce the vulnerability, including screenshots,  example HTTP request, and the sqlmap command used to exploit the vulnerability.
*   A fix commit reference is included, showing the vulnerability was addressed.
