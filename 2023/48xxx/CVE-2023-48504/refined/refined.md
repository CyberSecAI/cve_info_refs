This document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2023-48504.

**CVE-2023-48504**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application improperly sanitizes user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. An attacker could execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they interact with the vulnerable application. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the website, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors**: Network-based. An attacker injects malicious code via user input which is then stored and rendered by the application. When a user interacts with the stored malicious code, the XSS payload is triggered.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to input data into the application, and a victim user must interact with the stored malicious content. A low-privileged user can exploit this vulnerability.

The document also contains vulnerability details for multiple other CVEs:
* **CVE-2023-48440 to CVE-2023-48624, CVE-2023-47064, CVE-2023-47065, CVE-2023-51457 to CVE-2023-51464**: All of these are related to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that can lead to arbitrary code execution, with varying CVSS scores based on the attack vector and required privileges.
* **CVE-2023-48441**: Improper Access Control vulnerability leading to security feature bypass.

The document also mentions a potential impact from CVE-2023-25690 if a customer is using Apache httpd in a proxy with a non-default configuration.
