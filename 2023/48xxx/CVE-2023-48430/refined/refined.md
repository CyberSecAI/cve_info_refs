- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The REST API of affected devices does not check the length of parameters in certain conditions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing input validation on the length of parameters in the REST API.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious admin can crash the server by sending a crafted request to the API. The server will automatically restart, leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted request with overly long parameters to the REST API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a malicious admin with access to the REST API.
