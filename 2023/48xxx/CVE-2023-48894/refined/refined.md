Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper use of `servletRequest.getRequestURI()` in the `LogCostFilter.java` filter. This function returns the raw request URI, including special characters like `../`, without proper parsing or sanitization.
*   The filter uses `contains()` and `startsWith()` to check if a request path should be allowed. This allows path traversal using `../` to bypass authentication checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The filter intended to skip authentication for specific paths like `/doc.html`, `/user/login`, and `/user/register` and URLs starting with `allowUrls`. However, by injecting `../` into the URI, attackers can manipulate the path to match the allowed paths, while still reaching protected resources.
*   **Path Traversal:** The use of `../` allows attackers to navigate up the directory structure and access resources outside of the intended scope.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Leakage:** Attackers can bypass authentication and access backend interfaces which are meant to be protected. Specifically the example shows access to the `/jshERP-boot/user/getAllList` interface, which returns sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.
*   **Login Bypass:** By manipulating the request path, attackers can bypass login requirements and access backend functionalities without proper credentials.
*  **Full access to backend system:** In this case, the attacker gets full access to the backend system, and may use it to perform additional malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP GET request with a manipulated URI. By including `../` sequences within the path, the attacker can make the request appear as an allowed path to the filter, while redirecting the request to a protected resource.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of Application Structure:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the application's URL structure and the location of sensitive resources.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests and understand how to manipulate URIs, specifically by using path traversal techniques.
