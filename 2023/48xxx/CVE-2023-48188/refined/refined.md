- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of SQL parameter in the `Translate::getModuleTranslation()` method within the Opart Devis module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `id_opartdevis` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop.
    - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to the front end to expose tokens and unlock admin's AJAX scripts.
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks via HTTP calls. The vulnerability can be exploited through a simple HTTP request. The attack can be concealed, and standard front-end logs might only show "POST /".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction. They can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
