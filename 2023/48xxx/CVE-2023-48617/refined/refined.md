This document provides information on multiple CVEs, including CVE-2023-48617.

**CVE-2023-48617**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack (AV:N), with a low attack complexity (AC:L) and a user interaction (UI:R) required. An attacker with low privileges (PR:L) can inject malicious script that gets executed in the context of another user's browser.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires low privileges to inject the malicious script. The user needs to interact with the malicious content for the XSS to be triggered.
