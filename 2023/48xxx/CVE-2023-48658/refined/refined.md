{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `app/Model/AppModel.php` file in MISP lacks proper input validation for certain parameters. Specifically, the `checkParam` function did not enforce restrictions on the allowed characters for user-supplied input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform time-based SQL injection attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information such as password hashes and API keys.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting malicious input via HTTP POST requests to certain endpoints that use the vulnerable `checkParam` function, an attacker can inject SQL code into the database queries.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "cve": "CVE-2023-48658",
    "cvss3_base_score": "9.8",
