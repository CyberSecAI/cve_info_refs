- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Credentials provided during the creation of an `OnboardingTask` were exposed as arguments in the Celery task execution, which was visible in the Job Results view under the Additional Data tab.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of cleartext credentials. Specifically, the credentials passed to the onboarding task were stored in the database as task arguments.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with access to the Nautobot Job Results view can view the exposed credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have low-level access and be able to view job results, also user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability as it requires initiating the creation of an `OnboardingTask` with provided credentials. The vulnerability affects only versions 2.0.0 through 2.0.2 of the device onboarding app.
