- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-787, out-of-bounds write
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` indicates that the attack vector is local (AV:L), the attack complexity is low (AC:L), no privileges are required (PR:N), user interaction is required (UI:R), and the scope is unchanged (S:U).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to convince a user to interact with a malicious file, or a malicious process, locally.
