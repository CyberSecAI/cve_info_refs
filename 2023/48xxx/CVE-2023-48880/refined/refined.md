Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the EyouCMS application. Specifically, when modifying the menu name within the "Frontend Style Settings" of the backend admin panel, the application does not properly sanitize the user-provided input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the menu name field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the menu name, which is then stored in the application's database. This code is later executed in the victim's browser when they access the affected page or feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking: Stealing the user's session cookies to impersonate them.
    *   Data theft: Accessing sensitive information accessible to the user.
    *   Website defacement: Modifying the appearance of the website.
    *   Malware distribution: Redirecting users to malicious websites or triggering malware downloads.
    *   Phishing attacks: Displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the admin panel of the EyouCMS application.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by navigating to "Member Center" > "Function Configuration" > "Frontend Style Settings" > "PC Left Menu" and modifying a menu name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have administrative access to the backend of the EyouCMS application. This means the attacker must have the credentials of an administrator account to log in to the backend.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker injects JavaScript code within the menu name field, such as `<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>`.
*   The vulnerable code is located within the `POST` request to `/EyouCMS/login.php?m=admin&c=Index&a=changeTableVal&_ajax=1&lang=cn`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is the `value` parameter within the `POST` data, where the injected XSS payload is submitted.
*   The vulnerability is present in EyouCMS version <=V1.6.4-UTF8-SP1.
*   The injected script is executed when a user accesses their "Personal Center" from the frontend.
