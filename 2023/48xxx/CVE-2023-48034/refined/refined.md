The content is related to CVE-2023-48034.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the weak encryption used in the wireless communication protocol of the Acer Wireless Keyboard SK-9662. The keyboard uses a Texas Instruments CC2545 chip and transmits data using the Enhanced Shockburst protocol. The encryption scheme uses a one-byte key for AES encryption in CBC mode with a null IV.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Weak encryption:** The use of a single-byte (8-bit) key for AES encryption makes the encryption easily brute-forceable.
- **Predictable encryption:**  The use of CBC mode with null IV further weakens the encryption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Keystroke decryption:** Attackers can decrypt the wireless keystrokes transmitted by the keyboard.
- **Arbitrary keystroke injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary keystrokes into the target system, potentially allowing unauthorized access and control.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Wireless traffic capture:** Attackers must be in close physical proximity to the target keyboard to capture the 2.4 GHz radio traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Physical proximity:** The attacker needs to be physically close to the keyboard to intercept wireless communications.
- **Radio traffic capture capabilities:** Attacker needs to be able to capture 2.4 GHz radio traffic.
- **Brute-forcing capability:** The attacker needs to be able to quickly perform brute-force attacks on 8-bit AES key.
