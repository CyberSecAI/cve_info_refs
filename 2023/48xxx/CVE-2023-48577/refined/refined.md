**CVE-2023-48577 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software is vulnerable to Stored XSS (CWE-79). This means that user-provided data is not properly sanitized, allowing malicious scripts to be stored and executed in the context of other users' browsers.
