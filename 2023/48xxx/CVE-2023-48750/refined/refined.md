Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a "Broken Access Control" issue. This indicates a lack of proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function that allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the missing access control checks, which allow unauthorized actions. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly verify if the user has the right to perform a certain action before executing it.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact is described as "moderately dangerous" with the potential for exploitation. The specific impact will vary depending on the vulnerable function within the plugin. In general, broken access control can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access, modify data, or even take control of the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is not precisely detailed, but it is implied to be through the plugin's functions that lack access control checks. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable function, bypassing the intended access controls.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need any authentication. They can be unauthenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the "Void Elementor Post Grid Addon for Elementor Page builder" WordPress plugin, specifically in versions <= 2.1.10.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under OWASP Top 10 A1: Broken Access Control.
*   A patch is available in version 2.2 and later.
*   Patchstack provides a virtual patch to mitigate the issue until the plugin is updated.
