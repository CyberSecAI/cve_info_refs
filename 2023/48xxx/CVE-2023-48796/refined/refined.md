Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-48796

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the exposure of sensitive information through the application's management endpoints in Apache DolphinScheduler. Specifically, these endpoints are not configured to properly restrict access, leading to unauthorized disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Exposure:**  The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive data, such as database credentials, through the application's management endpoints.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The management endpoints are not properly protected, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information, including database credentials, potentially leading to further unauthorized access and data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker with network access to the affected Apache DolphinScheduler instance. The specific endpoint accessed is not provided in this content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application's network interface.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The content suggests that no authentication or specific privileges are required to access the vulnerable endpoints, meaning any user with network access could potentially exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects Apache DolphinScheduler versions from 3.0.0 before 3.0.2.
* A workaround is suggested by setting the `MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINTS_WEB_EXPOSURE_INCLUDE` environment variable or modifying the `application.yaml` file to restrict access to specific endpoints.
* Users are urged to upgrade to version 3.0.2, which resolves the issue.
