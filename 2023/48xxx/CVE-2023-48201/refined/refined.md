- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied content within the article's content editor, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Privilege escalation: A low-privileged user (e.g., an 'Editor') can escalate their privileges to higher-level groups, including 'Administrators' and 'Super Administrators'.
    - Full CMS control: The attacker can then create, edit, and delete any content, manage users, and potentially access the database.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - An attacker with the ability to create and edit articles injects malicious JavaScript into the 'Content' text editor.
    - The malicious script is then triggered when an administrator or super administrator views the article.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs an account with the ability to create and edit articles (e.g., a member of the 'Editors' group).
    - The attacker must be able to get a Super Administrator to view the malicious article for the code to execute.
