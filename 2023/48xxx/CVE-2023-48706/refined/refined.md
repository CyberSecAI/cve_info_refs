{
  "CVE-2023-48706": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in Vim versions prior to 9.0.2121. The vulnerability occurs during the execution of a `:s` command when a sub-replace-special atom is used within the substitution part. A recursive call to `:s` may lead to premature deallocation of memory, which the initial `:s` command later attempts to access.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability may also cause a crash of Vim.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted `:s` command that uses a sub-replace-special atom, specifically `~\\=`, and involves recursion through a Vim script function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to execute the vulnerable Vim command with a specific payload. The exploit seems to work reliably only if it is the first substitution command executed since a previous substitution atom does not yet exist."
