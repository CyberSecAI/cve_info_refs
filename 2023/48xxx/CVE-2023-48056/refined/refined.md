- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The PyPinkSign library uses a static, non-random Initialization Vector (IV) for AES encryption in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. Specifically, the IV is hardcoded to `0123456789012345`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **CWE-329:** Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode
    - **CWE-330:** Use of Insufficiently Random Values
    - Using a static IV for CBC encryption makes the encryption less secure and can lead to patterns in the ciphertext that can be exploited.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Disclosure of information about the plaintext of subsequent messages due to the predictable IV.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can potentially analyze the ciphertext of multiple encryptions to reveal information about the plaintext, due to the predictable IV.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to observe multiple encryptions performed with the vulnerable library. No specific privileged access is mentioned.
