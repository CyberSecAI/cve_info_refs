This document contains information about CVE-2023-48587, along with many other CVEs.

**CVE-2023-48587**
*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to Stored XSS (CWE-79). Input is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored and executed in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution can occur within the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to inject the malicious script into the application which is then stored. When another user views the stored script, their browser will execute the malicious code.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged attacker is needed to inject the malicious script into the application. The attacker requires the victim to interact with the stored XSS payload for exploitation.
