Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It arises from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when modifying document properties within the EyouCMS backend.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stored XSS:** The application stores the malicious script provided in the "Document Properties" name field within the database. This means the malicious payload is not executed during the initial input but is stored and subsequently executed later in the admin panel.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or encode the user-supplied data when modifying the "Document Properties" name. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Document Properties" name field. When this field is displayed in the admin panel (specifically when editing an article), the attacker's injected JavaScript code will be executed within the browser of any admin user who views the affected content.
- **Account Takeover/Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the injected JavaScript, the attacker could potentially perform actions on behalf of the victim user, such as stealing session cookies, redirecting the user to malicious websites, or further escalating privileges within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Admin Panel Access:** The attacker requires access to the admin panel of EyouCMS. This could be obtained through compromised admin credentials.
- **"Document Properties" Modification:** The attacker must navigate to the "Function Map," add "Document Properties," and then modify the name of one of the properties, injecting the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the EyouCMS backend to make the necessary modifications.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the stored XSS vulnerability present in the application.

**Technical Details:**

- The provided exploit uses the payload `<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>` in the "Document Properties" name field.
- The affected version of EyouCMS is <=V1.6.4-UTF8-SP1.
- The vulnerable functionality is in the `changeTableVal` endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue is similar to another XSS vulnerability described in issue #52 of the same repository, suggesting a recurring pattern of improper input handling within EyouCMS.
- The vulnerability has been confirmed and fixed by the maintainers.
