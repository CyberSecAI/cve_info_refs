#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Create a document "Secret" with content "Secret content" and restrict view right on it by, e.g., just granting view right for the admin group.
2. As guest user, open <xwiki-server>/xwiki/bin/get/XWiki/SuggestSolrService?outputSyntax=plain&media=json&nb=1000&query=q%3D\*%3A\*%0Aq.op%3DAND%0Afq%3Dtype%3ADOCUMENT%0Afl%3Dtitle\_%2C+reference%2C+links%2C+doccontentraw\_%2C+objcontent\_\_&input=+ where <xwiki-server> is the URL of your XWiki installation.

**Expected result:**

The document "Secret" is not listed.

**Actual result:**

All documents of the wiki and all subwikis are listed with full title, raw content and object contents including the "Secret" document. Note: you might need to adjust the "nb=1000" parameter to return more results in case the wanted results are not included.

The actual bug is in [SolrQueryExecutor#filterResponse](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/11e0ca1c4d92716170d97392ae0ff3d1d11551b2/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-search/xwiki-platform-search-solr/xwiki-platform-search-solr-query/src/main/java/org/xwiki/query/solr/internal/SolrQueryExecutor.java#L256) which skips the right check when the document reference cannot be resolved. For the document reference to be resolved, the results needs to have the "wiki", "spaces" and "name" fields. If they are excluded via the "fl" query parameter, no right check is performed accordingly.

This logic is unchanged since the introduction of Solr search in [~~XWIKI-5676~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-5676 "Implement new search engine using Apache Solr") in XWiki 4.3-milestone-2, I'm not sure though this is exploitable until the introduction of the JSON support in [~~XWIKI-11326~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11326 "Add support for returning search results as JSON in Solr search suggest service") in XWiki 6.3-milestone-2 as only the JSON response contains the full SOLR result (including potentially the whole content and objects) and I also get errors from the XML generation.

In CVSS, this is CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N so 7.5 (high). I'm still marking this as a blocker as this is a very important data leak for XWiki and would have been a blocker according to the now deprecated severity matrix.

# Whole content of all documents of all wikis exposed to anybody with view right on Solr suggest service

High

Nov 20, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-search-solr-query
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 6.3-milestone-2, < 14.10.15
>= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.5.1

## Patched versions

14.10.15
15.5.1, 15.6-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

The Solr-based search suggestion provider that also duplicates as generic JavaScript API for search results in XWiki exposes the content of all documents of all wikis to anybody who has access to it, by default it is public. This exposes all information stored in the wiki (but not some protected information like password hashes). While there is a right check normally, the right check can be circumvented by explicitly requesting fields from Solr that don't include the data for the right check. This can be reproduced by opening `<xwiki-server>/xwiki/bin/get/XWiki/SuggestSolrService?outputSyntax=plain&media=json&nb=1000&query=q%3D*%3A*%0Aq.op%3DAND%0Afq%3Dtype%3ADOCUMENT%0Afl%3Dtitle_%2C+reference%2C+links%2C+doccontentraw_%2C+objcontent__&input=+` where `<xwiki-server>` is the URL of the XWiki installation. If this displays any results, the wiki is vulnerable.

### Patches

This has been fixed in XWiki 15.6RC1, 15.5.1 and 14.10.15 by not listing documents whose rights cannot be checked.

### Workarounds

We're not aware of a workaround apart from upgrading to a fixed version.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
