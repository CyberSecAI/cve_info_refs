Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `SolrQueryExecutor#filterResponse` method within the XWiki platform. This method is responsible for filtering search results based on user permissions. The filtering logic relies on resolving the document reference from the Solr search results. However, it was discovered that if the document reference fields ("wiki", "spaces", and "name") are excluded from the Solr query using the "fl" parameter, the right check is skipped entirely, and the method doesn't prevent the user from seeing content they shouldn't.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to enforce access controls when the necessary fields for permission checking are absent from the Solr query response.
*   **Bypassable Security Check:**  The permission check is bypassable by crafting a specific Solr query that omits the fields required for the check. This results in the disclosure of sensitive content to unauthorized users.
*   **Dependency on specific fields:** The right check depends on the presence of `wiki`, `spaces`, and `name` fields in the Solr response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the content of all documents in all wikis, including private or restricted content. This includes not just the document title, but also the raw content and object contents.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive information, leading to a confidentiality breach.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through network access to the XWiki server.
*   **Crafted Solr Query:** The attack involves crafting a specific HTTP GET request to the XWiki server's `SuggestSolrService` endpoint, with a specially crafted Solr query in the "query" parameter. This query must include `fl` parameter excluding the necessary document reference fields ("wiki", "spaces", and "name").

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the XWiki instance.
*   **No authentication required:** No user authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Understanding of Solr Query Syntax:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of Solr query syntax to craft a query that excludes the necessary fields for access control.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present since the introduction of Solr search in XWiki 4.3-milestone-2 but was not exploitable until the introduction of JSON support in XWiki 6.3-milestone-2. The JSON response includes the full SOLR result which includes the content and objects.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in XWiki versions 15.6-rc-1, 15.5.1, and 14.10.15 by not listing documents whose rights cannot be checked.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.5 (High).
