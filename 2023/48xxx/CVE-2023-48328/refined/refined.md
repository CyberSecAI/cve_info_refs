- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NextGEN Gallery plugin for WordPress versions 3.37 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a CSRF attack which relies on tricking an authenticated user into performing actions on the application without their consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage while they are still authenticated with the vulnerable application. The attacker needs no prior authentication.
