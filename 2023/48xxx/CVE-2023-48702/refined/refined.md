Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `/System/MediaEncoder/Path` endpoint in Jellyfin executes arbitrary files using `ProcessStartInfo` via the `ValidateVersion` function without proper validation.
*   The `/Branding/Splashscreen` endpoint does not sufficiently validate file types allowing an attacker to upload a malicious executable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unvalidated Input:** The `/System/MediaEncoder/Path` endpoint accepts a file path without proper validation, allowing UNC paths to be specified.
*   **Arbitrary File Execution:** The application executes the file specified in the `/System/MediaEncoder/Path` endpoint.
*   **Insecure File Upload:** The `/Branding/Splashscreen` endpoint does not check the type of the uploaded file, relying on the content type provided in the header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A malicious administrator can execute arbitrary code on the Jellyfin server by providing a malicious executable through UNC path or through the `/Branding/Splashscreen` endpoint and then using the `/System/MediaEncoder/Path` endpoint.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **UNC Path Injection:** An administrator can provide a UNC path to a malicious executable on a network share through the `/System/MediaEncoder/Path` endpoint.
*   **File Upload with Incorrect Content Type:** An administrator can upload a malicious executable disguised as an image to the `/Branding/Splashscreen` endpoint and then trigger its execution via the `/System/MediaEncoder/Path` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrator Access:** The attacker must have administrator privileges to access the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Network Share Setup (for UNC Path attack):** For the UNC path attack, the attacker needs to have a network share accessible by the Jellyfin server.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests (for file upload attack):** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests with a specific content-type for the file upload attack.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by a GHSL team member and is tracked as GHSL-2023-028 and GHSL-2023-029.
* The fix involved removing the functionality of the `/System/MediaEncoder/Path` endpoint.
* The vulnerability is present in Jellyfin versions <= 10.8.12 and is fixed in 10.8.13
* The initial report was sent to maintainers on 2023-02-15, and the fix was released on 2023-11-22.
