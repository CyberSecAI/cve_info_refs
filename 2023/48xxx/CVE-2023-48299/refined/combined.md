This is the release of TorchServe v0.9.0.

## Security

Our security process is documented [here](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/db47936156a3e5803b42b38001f0f43affb7c720/SECURITY.md)

We rely heavily on automation to improve the security of `torchserve` namely by

1. On a monthly basis updating our `gradle` and `pip` dependencies
2. Docker scanning via Snyk
3. Code analysis via CodeQL

A key point to remember is that `torchserve` will allow you to configure things in an unsecure way so make sure to read our security docs and relevant security warnings to make sure your product is secure in production. In general we do not encourage you to download untrusted mar files from the internet, running a `.mar` file effectively is running arbitrary python code so make sure to unzip mar files and validate whether they are doing anything suspicious.

### Code scanning fixes

1. Used Sha-256 in ziputils [#2629](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2629) [@msaroufim](https://github.com/msaroufim)
2. Verified default hostname in Test [#2631](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2631) [@msaroufim](https://github.com/msaroufim)
3. Fixed zip slip error [#2634](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2634) [@msaroufim](https://github.com/msaroufim)

5. Enabled Netty HTTP header validation as default [#2630](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2630) [@msaroufim](https://github.com/msaroufim)
6. Verified 3rd party package installation path [#2687](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2687) [@lxning](https://github.com/lxning)
7. Allowed url validation [#2685](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2685) [@lxning](https://github.com/lxning) including

* Disabled loading TS\_ALLOWED\_URLS from env by default.
* Moved the model url validation to last step.

# TorchServe ZipSlip

Moderate

[namannandan](/namannandan)
published
GHSA-m2mj-pr4f-h9jp
Nov 21, 2023

## Package

torchserve

## Affected versions

>=0.1.0;<0.9.0

## Patched versions

0.9.0

## Description

### Impact

Using the model/workflow management API, there is a chance of uploading potentially harmful archives that contain files that are extracted to any location on the filesystem that is within the process permissions. Leveraging this issue could aid third-party actors in hiding harmful code in open-source/public models, which can be downloaded from the internet, and take advantage of machines running Torchserve.

### Patches

The ZipSlip issue in TorchServe has been fixed by validating the paths of files contained within a zip archive before extracting them: [#2634](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2634)

TorchServe release 0.9.0 includes fixes to address the ZipSlip vulnerability:

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
