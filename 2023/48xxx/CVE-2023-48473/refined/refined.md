This document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2023-48473.

**Vulnerability Details for CVE-2023-48473:**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it, leading to the ability to inject malicious scripts.
*  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through a vulnerable input field within Adobe Experience Manager. When a user views the page containing the injected code, the script executes in their browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires a low level of privilege to inject the malicious script and the user needs to interact with the injected code (e.g. by viewing a page containing the malicious script).
