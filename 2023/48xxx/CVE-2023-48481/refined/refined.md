Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-48481:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Important
*  **CVSS Base Score:** 5.4
*  **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**Explanation:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. This occurs when the application improperly handles user-supplied input that is later displayed to other users. In this case, malicious scripts are stored within the application and are executed within the browsers of other users when they access the affected content.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding. The application does not adequately sanitize or encode user input before storing it, and then displays it without proper encoding, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to various impacts, including session hijacking, cookie theft, phishing, defacement of websites, or other malicious actions, depending on what the attacker scripts.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker injects the malicious script into the application through a vulnerable input field.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have low privileges(PR:L) and requires user interaction(UI:R) .  They need the ability to input data into the application, which is subsequently stored and displayed to other users.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).
*   The CVSS vector indicates that the attack requires user interaction, the scope is changed (S:C), confidentiality impact is low(C:L), integrity impact is low(I:L) and availability impact is none(A:N)
*   The document lists multiple CVEs all related to XSS in AEM, suggesting this is a broad vulnerability issue in the product.
