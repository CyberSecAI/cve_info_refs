*   **Root Cause:** The Booster for WooCommerce plugin (versions <= 7.1.1) has a vulnerability that allows for sensitive data exposure.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The plugin suffers from a "Sensitive Data Exposure" vulnerability. This falls under the OWASP Top 10 category of "Broken Access Control."
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious actor could potentially view sensitive information that should not be accessible to regular users. This exposed data could then be used to exploit other weaknesses in the system. The specific impact can vary.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The details of the attack vector are not described in the provided context, but it can be inferred that it is related to broken access control.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have "Subscriber" level privileges to exploit the vulnerability. This suggests that the vulnerability can be exploited by a user with basic access to the system, not requiring higher administrative privileges.
