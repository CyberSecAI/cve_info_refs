    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious JavaScript code execution in the user's browser when rendering pages containing crafted content. This can lead to a variety of attacks such as session hijacking, credential theft, or defacement of the website.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted Custom Links",
      "Maliciously crafted Job Buttons",
        "Maliciously crafted Computed Fields"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to create or edit Custom Links, Job Buttons, or Computed Fields.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists due to the incorrect use of Django's `mark_safe()` API, which bypasses HTML escaping and can lead to XSS. The fix replaces `mark_safe()` with `format_html()` where appropriate, which performs necessary escaping."
