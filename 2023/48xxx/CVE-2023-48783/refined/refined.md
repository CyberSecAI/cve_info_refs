- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient access control over API endpoints. Specifically, the vulnerability is an "Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper access control (CWE-639).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote authenticated user with at least read-only permissions can gain access to other organization endpoints by crafting GET requests. This allows for unauthorized access to sensitive information belonging to other organizations.
- **Attack vectors**: Crafted GET requests sent to vulnerable API endpoints
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least read-only permissions to the FortiPortal.
