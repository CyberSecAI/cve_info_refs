- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a malicious website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target website.
