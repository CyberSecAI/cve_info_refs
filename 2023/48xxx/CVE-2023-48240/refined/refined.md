Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-48240:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how XWiki handles image embedding in rendered diffs. When generating a diff, XWiki fetches embedded images server-side to compare them. The issue is that these requests were made for images from any domain, including attacker-controlled domains. Critically, these requests also included all cookies from the original request, leading to potential session hijacking. The vulnerability is present in the `DefaultDataURIConverter` class when converting a URL to a data URI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application fetches remote resources based on user-controlled URLs without sufficient validation. This allows an attacker to make the server perform requests to internal or external resources.
2.  **Cookie Stealing:** The server-side image fetching process includes all cookies present in the original user's request. This means if a user views a diff containing an image from a malicious server, their session cookies are sent to the attacker, potentially allowing impersonation of the user.
3.  **Insecure Data Handling:** The fetched content from the external URLs was cached without proper user-specific context. This resulted in a scenario where, once a resource was successfully cached by one user, it could be served to other users regardless of their access permissions.
4. **Unrestricted Domain Access:** The image embedding feature did not restrict domains from where images were loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could steal user session cookies, enabling them to impersonate legitimate users and access their accounts.
2.  **Data Exfiltration:** The SSRF vulnerability allows the attacker to make the server fetch and potentially leak internal content.
3.  **Cache Poisoning:**  The shared cache could be filled with content fetched by an attacker or a privileged user, then made available to any user. This could lead to exposure of sensitive information or defacement.
4.  **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can cause the server to make requests to other internal services.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious Image in Diff:** An attacker creates a malicious document with 101 images pointing to their server, then crafts a diff that forces the server to fetch those images during the render process. This can be triggered when a user views an image referencing that diff.
2.  **Attacker-Controlled Server:** The attacker needs a server to receive the requests containing the stolen cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Ability to Create/Edit Documents:** The attacker needs to be able to create or edit XWiki documents to embed malicious image URLs.
2.  **External Server:** The attacker needs access to an external server to receive stolen cookies.
3.  **Low Privileges:** Only low privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
4. **User Interaction:** The victim user must view a page that causes the vulnerable code to execute, making user interaction a requirement.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by:
    *   Only downloading images from trusted domains.
    *   Only sending cookies when the image's domain matches the request domain.
    *   Making the cache user-specific.
    *   Adding configuration options for timeout, maximum size and if the feature is enabled at all.
*   The vulnerability is present in `org.xwiki.diff.xml.internal.DefaultDataURIConverter`.
*   The commit `bff0203e739b6e3eb90af5736f04278c73c2a8bb` on the XWiki platform repository contains the fix for this vulnerability.
*   The number of 101 images is to bypass the cache of 100 elements.
*   The vulnerability is tracked in the XWiki issue tracker as XWIKI-20818.
*   The severity was classified as 'Critical', with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.1.

**Vulnerable versions:**

*   >= 11.10.1, < 14.10.15
*   >= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.5.1
*   >= 15.6-rc-1, < 15.6

**Patched versions:**

*   14.10.15
