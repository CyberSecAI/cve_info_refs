**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an OS command injection flaw present in an admin operation within Dell PowerProtect DD Management Center (DDMC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary OS Command Execution: Successful exploitation allows a local high-privileged attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the managed system's underlying OS.
*   System Takeover: This can lead to a complete system takeover of the managed system by the attacker, as the commands are executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application.
