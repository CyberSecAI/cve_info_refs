The provided document is an Adobe security bulletin that includes CVE-2023-48520 among a large list of vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2023-48520
*   **Vulnerability Category:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*  **Severity:** Important
*   **CVSS Base Score:** 5.4
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   **Affected Product:** Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
*   **Affected Versions:** AEM Cloud Service (CS) and 6.5.18.0 and earlier versions

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that malicious script can be permanently stored within the AEM application.

**Weaknesses:**
The weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or encoding of user-provided data. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser session. This could potentially lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement of web pages
    *   Malware distribution

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can inject malicious scripts through a user-provided input field within the AEM application. This input is then stored, and when a user views the content containing the malicious script, the script will be executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be in a position to provide input to a vulnerable part of the application.
    *   The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) to inject the malicious script.
    *   A user must interact with (UI:R) the stored malicious content by visiting the page.
