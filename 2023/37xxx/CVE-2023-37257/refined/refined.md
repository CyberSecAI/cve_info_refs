- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of user-supplied input in the DataEase panel and dataset components, leading to stored XSS vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `v-html` directive is used without proper sanitization on user-controlled data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not sanitize user input before rendering it within `v-html` tags in the panel export and dataset directory creation functionalities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the DataEase application via the panel and dataset features by creating a dashboard or a dataset directory using a payload such as `<audio src=x onerror=confirm('XSS')>`. When other users, including administrators, interact with the malicious data, the injected JavaScript executes within their browser session, leading to potential cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector involves injecting malicious javascript into data that is later rendered unsanitized via the `v-html` attribute within the DataEase application. Specifically, a user can create a dashboard with a malicious name or create a dataset directory with a malicious name.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be a user of the DataEase application and have the ability to create or modify dashboards or dataset directories. This could be a standard user with the required permissions, or an attacker who has compromised a valid user account.
