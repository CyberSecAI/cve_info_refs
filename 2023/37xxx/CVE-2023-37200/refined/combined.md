Schneider Electric Security Notification

EcoStruxure™ OPC UA Server Expert, Modicon Communication Server

11 July 2023 (13 August 2024)

Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of a vulnerability in its EcoStruxure™ OPC UA Server Expert
product.

EcoStruxure™ OPC UA Server Expert is a communications platform seamlessly linking
Schneider Electric PLCs and connected devices to enterprise information systems and the
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) via the OPC Foundation’s Open Platform Communications –
Unified Architecture (OPC UA) service-oriented architecture standard.

Modicon Communication Server manages the communication configuration between Modicon
PAC controllers (M340, M580) and Wonderware System Platform. The server embeds the
capabilities of the EcoStruxure™ OPC Server Expert (for Modicon Controllers only) to make all
the variables selected for the HMI available within the supervision.

Failure to apply the remediation provided below may risk confidentiality, which could result in
disclosure of sensitive information from the system running the software.

August 2024 Update: Modicon Communication Server offer was added to the Affected Products
and Versions table and a remediation is now available on Modicon Communication Server
(page 2).

Customers should use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to
their systems. We strongly recommend the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these
patches in a Test and Development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact
Schneider Electric’s Customer Care Center if you need assistance removing a patch.

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately
apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Follow workstation, network, and site-hardening guidelines in the Recommended

Cybersecurity Best Practices Guide available for download here.
•  Only open project configuration files received from a trusted source.
•  Encrypt project configuration files when stored and restrict access to only trusted users.
•  When exchanging files over network, use secure communication protocols.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.

•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
