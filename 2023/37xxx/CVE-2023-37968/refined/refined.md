- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Falang multilanguage WordPress plugin (<= 1.3.39) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the context of the actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into making a crafted request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no authentication and only needs to lure a logged-in user into performing a malicious action.
