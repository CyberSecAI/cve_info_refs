The content is related to CVE-2023-37831.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the application's different responses based on whether a user exists or not when trying to access a user profile for editing. It returns different HTTP status codes (200, 302, or 404) based on whether the user exists and if the current user has access to the requested user's profile.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
User enumeration vulnerability due to inconsistent server responses. The server provides distinct responses based on the existence and accessibility of user profiles, allowing an attacker to distinguish between existing and non-existing users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can use the different responses to enumerate valid user identifiers on the system. This can lead to attackers gaining knowledge of valid usernames, which they can then use in subsequent attacks such as password brute-forcing or social engineering. The identified users can then be targeted for further attacks to gain access to their accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attacker leverages the profile page edit functionality through the REST URL, where the user ID is specified in the URL. By changing the user ID in the URL and observing server response (200, 302 or 404), attackers can determine if the user ID exists and infer valid usernames.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker only needs to be a low-privilege user with the ability to access the profile edit page and the ability to manipulate the REST URL. The attacker does not need any special privileges or specific access to the application other than a normal low-privilege user account.
