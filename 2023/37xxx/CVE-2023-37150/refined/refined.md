**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
* This could lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or redirecting users to malicious websites. The attacker could also potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** Specifically targeting the "/admin/index.php?page=categories" page of the online pizza ordering system.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user (likely an administrator) to access the malicious payload via the categories input field on the vulnerable page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable input field within the administrative interface.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication to inject the XSS payload. However, a user interaction is required to trigger it.
*   The attacker can be remote, with network access to the vulnerable application.
