Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-37955:

**CVE-2023-37955**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Test Results Aggregator Plugin does not perform a permission check on an HTTP endpoint that implements form validation and doesn't require POST requests for this endpoint.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** An HTTP endpoint lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to access it.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The HTTP endpoint does not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified username and password through the vulnerable endpoint.
    *   The lack of CSRF protection allows an attacker to induce a victim's browser to make requests to the vulnerable endpoint, potentially capturing credentials.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker leverages the vulnerable HTTP endpoint.
    *   CSRF attacks can be carried out via malicious websites or links.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs to have `Overall/Read` permission in Jenkins.
    *   Attacker needs to be able to induce a victim's browser to make requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that there is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the publication date.
*   The Test Results Aggregator Plugin is vulnerable to both CSRF (CVE-2023-37955) and a missing permission check (CVE-2023-37956).
