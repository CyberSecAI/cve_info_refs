- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Themesflat Addons For Elementor Plugin <= 2.0.0 is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** PHP Object Injection. This allows attackers to potentially execute code injection, SQL injection, path traversal, denial of service, and more if a proper POP chain exists.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to code injection, SQL injection, path traversal, denial of service, and other attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. They would need to send a crafted request that injects a malicious PHP object.
