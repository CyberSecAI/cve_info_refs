The provided content details a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in xalpha versions v0.11.4 to v0.11.8.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `xalpha/info.py` file, specifically within the `fundinfo._basic_init` function. This function uses the `eval()` function on user-provided input without proper sanitization or verification. By crafting a malicious input string, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary Python code. The `self.url` variable can be manipulated using relative path traversal (e.g. `../`) to control the execution context.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unsafe use of `eval()`:** The core weakness is the use of the `eval()` function on unsanitized user input, which allows arbitrary code execution.
- **Lack of input validation:** The application fails to validate user-supplied input, allowing a malicious URL string to be passed to the `fundinfo` function.
- **Path Traversal:** Relative path traversal using `../` allows manipulation of the URL and execution context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable xalpha application. This can lead to:
- **Complete server compromise:** Attackers can gain full control over the server by using functions such as `os.system()` to execute system commands.
- **Data theft or manipulation:** Attackers can access or modify sensitive data stored on the server.
- **Denial of service:** Attackers can potentially crash the server, causing downtime.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `xalpha.fundinfo()` function, where the user-controlled input is passed as an argument.
- This can be exploited in scenarios where a website backend uses `xalpha` and doesn't properly validate user input passed to the `fundinfo` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious URL string as an argument to the `xalpha.fundinfo()` function, where the vulnerable application processes the input.
- If a server or website uses xalpha as a backend, and the user input is not validated, the attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely.
