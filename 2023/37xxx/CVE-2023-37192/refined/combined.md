# Bitcoin Core

Helping you keep Bitcoin decentralized.

[Download Bitcoin Core](/en/download)
Bitcoin Core 27.0
![Windows](/img/os/windows.png?1736694469)

---

Bitcoin Core is programmed to decide which block chain contains
valid transactions. The users of Bitcoin Core only accept
transactions for that block chain, making it the Bitcoin block
chain that everyone else wants to use. For the latest developments related to
Bitcoin Core, be sure to visit the projectâs [official website](https://bitcoincore.org).

![icon](/img/bitcoin-core/decentralized.svg?1736694469)

Decentralized

It is these users who keep Bitcoin decentralized. They
individually run their own Bitcoin Core full nodes, and each of
those full nodes separately follows the exact same rules to decide
which block chain is valid.

![icon](/img/bitcoin-core/no_voting.svg?1736694469)

No Voting

There's no voting or other corruptible process involved: there's
just individual software following identical rulesâ"math"âto
evaluate identical blocks and coming to identical conclusions
about which block chain is valid.

This shared agreement (called consensus) allows people like you to only accept valid bitcoins, enforcing Bitcoin's rules against even the most powerful miners.In addition to improving Bitcoin's decentralization, Bitcoin Core users get:

* [Better security](/en/bitcoin-core/features/validation) for their bitcoins
* [Privacy features](/en/bitcoin-core/features/privacy) not available in other wallets
* [User interfaces](/en/bitcoin-core/features/user-interface) and other powerful features

[June 22, 2023](https://satoshihunter1.blogspot.com/2023/06/the-bitcoin-app-is-vulnerable-to-hackers.html "permanent link")

The Bitcoin app is vulnerable to hackers!

Description

Bitcoin Core Latest version 22.0 suffers from a memory
management issue that enables attackers to redirect funds to their own Bitcoin
address.

DATE(S) ISSUED: 06/22/2023

RISK: Critical

Businesses:

Large and medium Bitcoin miners HIGH

Home Users: LOW

Method: Remote thread execution

OVERVIEW:

The Bitcoin app on Windows is currently facing issues
related to memory management and memory protection. These vulnerabilities allow
attackers to modify the stored sending address within the app's memory,
ultimately leading to the redirection of Bitcoin transactions to their own
wallets.

Attackers Method:

The Bitcoin app is suffering from memory management issues,
allowing attackers to open bitcoin’s process and search for Bitcoin wallet
addresses stored in the memory. While Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing
algorithm to encrypt the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain, the BTC
addresses themselves are not encrypted in the memory.

When a transaction occurs on the Bitcoin blockchain, it
takes place through the utilization of public addresses. These public addresses
are stored within the Bitcoin app prior to initiating the process.

An attacker can simply search for these BTC addresses, which
consist of a string of 26-35 letters and numbers, enabling them to easily
locate all the Bitcoin wallets stored in the Bitcoin app and replace them with
their own.

When an attacker replaces the public address, it can result
in a straightforward redirection of Bitcoin transactions to their own wallets.
Due to the inherent nature of Bitcoin, this process is Irreversible.

This method closely resembles the widely-known point-of-sale
malware called Tinypos.

My research about Tinypos can be found here:

<https://securitynews.sonicwall.com/xmlpost/tinypos-a-new-multi-component-pos-family-actively-spreading-in-the-wild/>

To my understanding, we can expect to see an increase in the
prevalence of Bitcoin point-of-sale (POS) malware in the near future!

The major difference between Tinypos and Bitcoin malware is
that Bitcoin operates in a decentralized manner without a central authority.
Therefore, if you become a victim of an attack, your funds will be permanently
lost!

Video of Attack:

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEl4M1oZim0>

In this video, I used an app called Cheat Engine to
demonstrate how hacking a Bitcoin wallet works. As you can see in the video, I
created a Bitcoin sending address under my name. An attacker can easily gain
access to the Bitcoin memory app and replace it with another BTC wallet,
causing all funds to be transferred to their own wallet during any transaction!

POC:

  Hi Guys This is Nima Bagheri Cyber security Expert and This is How i find Satoshi Nakamoto i was suspicious about Satoshi Nakamoto when i have seen this post on bitcointalk.org This user was asking about the latest satoshi build and if you check bitcoin.org you can only see the bitcoin 0.3.2. 1 and version 0.3.2.0   is missing so i thought why not to take a look!  I was able to download bitcoin 0.3.2.0    via virustotal because this file has been remove from everywhere. Here is the link for you. Bitcoin 0.3.19 is the latest build that was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin 0.3.20 is the first Bitcoin developed by Gavin Andresen.

Why Dr Back is not confirming that he is Satoshi Nakamoto ? Check my video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHnfS0k2614 I would like to let Adam Back speak about himself. Let's check his Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam\_Back&oldid=120281396 https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam\_Back&oldid=120273718 In 2007 when no one knew about Crypto Adam described himself as a Crypto Anarchist Leanings and Capitalist. And then within a few hours, Adam changed his bio to  Crypto Anarchist and Capitalist Leanings. Here is the interesting part, 4 weeks after Satoshi has been disappeared from the public this information about Adam back has been removed  from Adam's Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam\_Back&dir=prev&action=history https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam\_Back&oldid=436626208 Guess what, who did that? another Ph.D. software engineer called David Eppstein from UK trying to do a favor to his be...
