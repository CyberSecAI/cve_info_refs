**CVE-2023-37964:**

*   **Root Cause:** The ElasticBox CI Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints and does not require POST requests for these endpoints.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Missing permission checks on HTTP endpoints.
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the lack of POST request requirement.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Attacker sends a crafted request to vulnerable HTTP endpoints.
    *   CSRF attack through a malicious link or page that triggers the request on a victim's browser
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to know or obtain valid credential IDs through other means.
    *   Attacker needs to be able to induce a user with a valid Jenkins session to visit a malicious URL or page.
