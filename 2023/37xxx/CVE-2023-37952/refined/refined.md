The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-37952.

**CVE-2023-37952**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The mabl Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints and these endpoints do not require POST requests.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Missing permission check: HTTP endpoints lack proper authorization controls, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, making them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method. This allows for the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Network: Attackers send crafted requests to vulnerable HTTP endpoints.
    *   Social engineering: CSRF attacks can be triggered by tricking users into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *  Attackers need Overall/Read permission in Jenkins to exploit the missing permission check.
    *  Attackers must trick users into triggering a malicious request to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.
