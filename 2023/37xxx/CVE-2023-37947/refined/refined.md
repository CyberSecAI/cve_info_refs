**CVE-2023-37947: Open redirect vulnerability in OpenShift Login Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The OpenShift Login Plugin improperly validates redirect URLs after login, failing to ensure they point back to the Jenkins instance.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Inadequate Redirect URL Validation:** The plugin does not properly verify that the redirect URL after login is within the Jenkins domain or a trusted location.
    *   **Open Redirect:** This allows a malicious actor to specify an arbitrary URL as the redirect target.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites after they successfully authenticate with Jenkins, potentially tricking users into providing their credentials on a fake site.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Social Engineering:** Attackers would need to convince users to visit a specially crafted Jenkins URL which, after successful login, redirects them to a malicious site.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **No Specific Privileges:** The attacker does not require any specific privileges on the Jenkins system.
    *   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and use social engineering techniques to trick users into clicking it.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in OpenShift Login Plugin versions 1.1.0.227.v27e08dfb\_1a\_20 and earlier.
*   The fix involves the plugin only redirecting to relative (Jenkins) URLs in version 1.1.0.230.v5d7030b\_f5432.
* The CVSS score for this vulnerability is Medium.
