{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper HTML filtering when saving or updating categories within the Chamilo LMS platform. Specifically, the `create_category_session` and `edit_category_session` functions in `main/inc/lib/sessionmanager.lib.php` were vulnerable.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper neutralization of input during web page generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the category name field. This malicious code would then be executed when the category is displayed, potentially leading to various impacts like unauthorized access, data theft, or defacement of the platform.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker can inject malicious HTML code in the `sname` parameter when creating or editing a category session."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker would require an account with the necessary permissions to create or edit session categories. An authenticated user can carry out the attack by injecting malicious HTML into the category name field."
