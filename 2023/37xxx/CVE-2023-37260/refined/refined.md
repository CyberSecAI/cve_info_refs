Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `CryptKey` constructor in the `league/oauth2-server` library, when provided with a key as a string and an invalid passphrase, would include the key in the generated `LogicException` message. This exposed the secret key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of a sensitive cryptographic key in an exception message. This could allow an attacker to compromise the security of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who obtains the exposed key could potentially decrypt sensitive data, forge tokens, or perform other actions that require knowledge of the key.
- **Integrity Breach:** With the private key, attackers might be able to sign malicious data, leading to integrity issues.
- **Complete compromise:** In a full compromise scenario, the attacker will be able to impersonate the OAuth server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is primarily through a network connection where the attacker can trigger the generation of the `LogicException` which includes the key.
- An attacker can leverage the exception through incorrect usage of the `CryptKey` constructor, specifically by providing a string as key and an invalid passphrase, in a network call.
- This attack does not require user interaction or specific user privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests that lead to the execution of the vulnerable code and trigger the exception.
- **Understanding of the Code:** The attacker needs to understand how the library is used, or have access to the log files that expose the keys, in order to craft the attack.
- **No Specific Privileges:** The attacker does not need prior privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was patched in versions 8.5.3 and 8.4.2 of the `league/oauth2-server` library.
- The recommended workaround for systems that cannot upgrade is to pass the key as a file path instead of a string to the `CryptKey` constructor.
- This vulnerability was reported by MHC03.
- The severity is rated as **High**, with a CVSS v3 score of 8.2.
- The vulnerability was assigned the CVE ID **CVE-2023-37260.**
