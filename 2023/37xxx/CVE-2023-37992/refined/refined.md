- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Smarty for WordPress plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious request that the victim is tricked into submitting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted request. The user needs to have sufficient privileges to perform a sensitive action within the application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
