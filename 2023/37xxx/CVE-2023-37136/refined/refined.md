The provided content is related to a reported issue for the `eyoucms` project on GitHub. It mentions a cross-site storage vulnerability (likely XSS) in the "Basic Website Information" module of EyouCMS V1.6.3.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The issue is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the "Basic Website Information" module of EyouCMS V1.6.3. While not explicitly mentioned, it likely involves improper handling of user-supplied input when rendering the "Basic Website Information", allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically stored XSS
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the stored XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when they view the "Basic Website Information" section. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the page.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the "Basic Website Information" module in EyouCMS V1.6.3, where malicious JavaScript is injected.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious content into the "Basic Website Information" module. This could be through various means, such as an admin or editor account with write access to the settings.
