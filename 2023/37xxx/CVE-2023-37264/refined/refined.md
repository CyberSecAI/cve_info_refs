  "related": true,
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Tekton Pipelines controller does not validate the UIDs of child resources (TaskRuns/Runs) before associating them with a PipelineRun, leading to potential resource hijacking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation (specifically, missing UID verification)",
      "Insufficient authorization checks (bypassed by leveraging name + ownerReference matching)",
      "Reliance on name instead of UID for child resource association"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who can create TaskRuns in a cluster can potentially craft a malicious TaskRun that would be falsely associated with a legitimate PipelineRun, thereby allowing manipulation of the legitimate pipeline's execution, config, and results. This allows for the potential to perform supply chain attacks by injecting malicious tasks into trusted pipelines.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Creating a malicious TaskRun with a matching name and owner reference to a legitimate PipelineRun's expected TaskRun."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create TaskRuns on the target cluster. No specific access to the targeted PipelineRun is required.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability is further elaborated on in the second content, titled \"Pipelines do not validate child UIDs\". This vulnerability is identified as CVE-2023-37264 and is described as low severity with a CVSS score of 3.7. It affects versions >= v0.35.0 of the Tekton Pipelines controller. The vulnerability stems from only validating (api version, kind, name) of child objects through ChildStatusReference field rather than also checking UID. A sample exploit is shown with instructions on how to create a legitimate PipelineRun and then insert a malicious TaskRun, which causes the PipelineRun to use the results from the malicious TaskRun, thereby demonstrating the lack of UID validation. The vulnerability exists due to missing UID checks in the reconcile loop code in pipelinerun.go"
