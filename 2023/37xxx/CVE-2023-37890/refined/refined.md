- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, leading to broken access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically a missing check that would prevent unprivileged users from executing higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that require higher privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is in the WordPress plugin KB Support, which can be exploited by a subscriber (unprivileged user). The exact method is not detailed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber on the WordPress site. They do not require any special privileges beyond this, and can access the vulnerable functionality to gain elevated privileges.
