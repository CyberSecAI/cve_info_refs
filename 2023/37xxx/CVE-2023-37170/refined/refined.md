{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The device does not require authentication for the `setLanguageCfg` request, which is vulnerable to OS command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "OS command injection due to unsanitized input in the `lang` parameter of the `setLanguageCfg` request.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary OS commands can be executed on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` with the `topicurl` set to `setLanguageCfg` and the `lang` parameter containing the malicious command.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
