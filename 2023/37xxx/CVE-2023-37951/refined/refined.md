Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-37951:

**CVE-2023-37951: Exposure of system-scoped credentials in mabl Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The mabl Plugin (versions 0.0.46 and earlier) does not set the correct context during credentials lookup. This oversight allows the plugin to access system-scoped credentials which are meant for global configurations and not for specific job configurations.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Credential Lookup:** The plugin's failure to define the appropriate context for credential lookups allows it to bypass the intended restrictions on credential access.
    *   **Exposure of System-Scoped Credentials:**  System-scoped credentials, intended for global configurations, become accessible where they shouldn't be.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Credentials:** Attackers with Item/Configure permission can access and capture sensitive credentials (system-scoped credentials) that they are not authorized to use. This can lead to further unauthorized access or control over other systems or resources.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs to have Item/Configure permissions within the Jenkins environment.
    *  The attacker needs to leverage the vulnerable plugin's incorrect credentials lookup logic.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have "Item/Configure" permissions in Jenkins. This means the attacker can configure job settings.
    *  The attacker would need to configure the Mabl plugin in such a way to trigger the credential lookup, where it then can obtain system-scoped credentials.

**Summary**

The vulnerability lies in the mabl plugin's flawed handling of credential lookups, where it fails to enforce proper scoping, thereby enabling users with "Item/Configure" permissions to obtain credentials they are not meant to access. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information and further attacks within the Jenkins environment.
