Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-37262

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient default blacklist in the CC-Tweaked Minecraft mod that fails to block access to the Instance Metadata Services (IMDS) of popular cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Oracle Cloud, Alibaba Cloud). This allows users of the mod to access sensitive information from the cloud infrastructure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary weakness is the ability of a user to make HTTP requests to arbitrary internal IP addresses or domains using the mod's functionality.
- **Insufficient Blacklist:** The mod's default blacklist of forbidden addresses is incomplete, missing critical IP ranges and domains used by cloud provider IMDS.
- **Lack of IPv6 Filtering:** The initial implementation did not correctly filter IPv6 addresses, leading to broader access to the local IPv6 network.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows a malicious user to access sensitive data exposed by IMDS, such as:
    - User-data passed to the system at boot time, which may contain secrets
    - IAM role credentials, potentially leading to full access of the AWS cloud account
    - Managed identity credentials for Azure
    - Service account tokens, granting access to the GCP account.
- **Privilege Escalation/Lateral Movement:** Gaining access to IMDS can allow an attacker to escalate privileges or move laterally within the cloud environment, potentially compromising the hosting provider.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** Attackers can use the in-game computer provided by the mod to craft HTTP requests to the cloud provider's IMDS endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** Any player on a Minecraft server with the CC-Tweaked mod installed and enabled can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Access to In-Game Computer:** The attacker needs access to the computer interface provided by the mod to make HTTP requests.
- **Basic Knowledge of IMDS:**  The attacker needs to know the IP address of the cloud metadata service and the specific path to access the sensitive information.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue is a follow up to a previous report made in 2017 ([dan200/ComputerCraft#170](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/issues/170)). This was initially reported for ComputerCraft mod and later fixed in CC-Tweaked.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the mod before the patch.
- A similar vulnerability was found in the OpenComputers mod ([GHSA-vvfj-xh7c-j2cm](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/security/advisories/GHSA-vvfj-xh7c-j2cm))

**Mitigations:**
- Upgrade to the patched version of CC-Tweaked (1.106.0).
- Use the mod's configuration options to manually blacklist the IP addresses or domains of cloud provider IMDS if upgrading is not possible.

**CVSS Score:**
- **Severity:** Critical
- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 9.6
- **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N
