Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-37960:

**CVE-2023-37960**

*   **Root Cause:** The MathWorks Polyspace Plugin does not restrict the path of attached files in the Polyspace Notification post-build step.
*   **Weakness:** The plugin lacks proper input validation/sanitization for file paths, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary file paths from the Jenkins controller filesystem in email attachments.
*   **Impact:** Attackers with Item/Configure permissions can send emails containing arbitrary files from the Jenkins controller file system. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the Jenkins server, as any file accessible to the Jenkins process can be attached and sent in emails.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with Item/Configure permissions can configure the Polyspace Notification post-build step to specify arbitrary file paths, which are then attached to emails sent by the plugin.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have Item/Configure permission within the Jenkins instance to modify job configurations, specifically to configure the Polyspace Notification post-build step and to provide file paths to be attached.

**Summary**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of path validation in the MathWorks Polyspace Plugin. This allows a user with the Item/Configure permission to attach arbitrary files from the Jenkins controller to emails, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information.
