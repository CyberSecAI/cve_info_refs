The content provided relates to CVE-2023-37271.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that RestrictedPython did not properly restrict access to stack frames and their attributes. Specifically, stack frames were accessible within generators and generator expressions, which are permitted in RestrictedPython.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate restrictions on access to stack frames and their attributes within RestrictedPython.
- Lack of checks preventing traversal of the stack beyond the RestrictedPython invocation boundary.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could escape the restricted scope of RestrictedPython.
- This could lead to arbitrary code execution in the Python interpreter.
- Attackers could gain control of the system or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers with access to a RestrictedPython environment can write code that gets the current stack frame in a generator and then walk the stack all the way beyond the RestrictedPython invocation boundary.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to a RestrictedPython environment.
- They must be able to write and execute Python code within that environment.
- In specific contexts such as Zope and Plone, this could involve creating or editing objects like `Script (Python)`, `DTML Method`, `DTML Document` or `Zope Page Template`.
