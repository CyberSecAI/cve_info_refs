# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1806

## GTKWave VCD get\_vartoken realloc use-after-free vulnerabilities

##### January 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-37576,CVE-2023-37577,CVE-2023-37573,CVE-2023-37578,CVE-2023-37575,CVE-2023-37574

##### SUMMARY

Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities exist in the VCD get\_vartoken realloc functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115. A specially crafted .vcd file can lead to arbitrary code execution. A victim would need to open a malicious file to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

GTKWave 3.3.115

##### PRODUCT URLS

GTKWave - <https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-416 - Use After Free

##### DETAILS

GTKWave is a wave viewer, often used to analyze FPGA simulations and logic analyzer captures. It includes a GUI to view and analyze traces, as well as convert across several file formats (`.lxt`, `.lxt2`, `.vzt`, `.fst`, `.ghw`, `.vcd`, `.evcd`) either by using the UI or its command line tools. GTKWave is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS. Trace files can be shared within teams or organizations, for example to compare results of simulation runs across different design implementations, to analyze protocols captured with logic analyzers or just as a reference when porting design implementations.

GTKWave sets up mime types for its supported extensions. For example, it’s enough for a victim to double-click on a wave file received by e-mail to trigger some of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.

VCD (Value Change Dump) files are parsed by the `vcd_parse` function. This function is duplicated in several conversion utilities (`vcd2lxt`, `vcd2lxt2`, `vcd2vzt`) and in the GUI portion of GTKWave. In general the various implementations are very similar or identical, and in this case they are all affected by the issue described in this advisory.

Let’s describe the execution flow for the `vcd2lxt` utility. The other implementations have very similar behavior.

The function `vcd_parse` loops over each line in the file [1] and, depending on which token has been read [2], a different switch block is executed:

```
     static void vcd_parse(int linear) {
         int tok;

[1]      for (;;) {
[2]          switch (get_token()) {
                 ...

```

The `get_token()` function simply extracts a token from the file at the current cursor position, saving it to the global `yytext` buffer and assigning the token’s length to the global `yylen`.

Moreover, if the token does not start with “$”, the token is considered a special symbol, and it has to match one of these tokens:

```
char *tokens[] = {"var", "end", "scope", "upscope",
                  "comment", "date", "dumpall", "dumpoff", "dumpon",
                  "dumpvars", "enddefinitions",
                  "dumpports", "dumpportsoff", "dumpportson", "dumpportsall",
                  "timescale", "version", "vcdclose", "timezero",
                  "", "", ""};

```

The return value of `get_token` is a token type, which is an index inside the `tokens` array above.

If the token does not start with “$”, the token is considered a string and the returned token type will be `T_STRING`.

Going back to the `switch` above, if the parsed token is “$var”, the token type will be `T_VAR` and we will enter the block at [3]:

```
[3]  case T_VAR: {
         int vtok;
         struct vcdsymbol *v = NULL;

         var_prevch = 0;
         ...
[4]      vtok = get_vartoken(1);

```

A new token is read using `get_vartoken()` [5] and saved into `vtok`.

This function, similarly to `get_token()`, extracts a token from the file, separated by any of “ “, “\t”, “\n”, or “\r”.

However, it has additional functionalities, as it allows for specifying variable names using a range format to declare their width.

```
     static int get_vartoken(int match_kw) {
         int ch;
         int i, len = 0;

         ...
         if (!var_prevch) {
             for (;;) {
[5]              ch = getch();
                 if (ch < 0) return (V_END);
                 if ((ch == ' ') || (ch == '\t') || (ch == '\n') || (ch == '\r')) continue;
                 break;
             }
         } else {
             ch = var_prevch;
             var_prevch = 0;
         }
         ...

[6]      for (yytext[len++] = ch;; yytext[len++] = ch) {
[12]         if (len == T_MAX_STR) {
                yytext = (char *)realloc_2(yytext, (T_MAX_STR = T_MAX_STR * 2) + 1);
             }

[7]          ch = getch();
             if (ch == ' ') {
                 if (match_kw) break;
[8]              if (getch_peek() == '[') {
                     ch = getch();
[9]                  varsplit = yytext + len; /* keep looping so we get the *last* one */
                     continue;
                 }
             }

             if ((ch == ' ') || (ch == '\t') || (ch == '\n') || (ch == '\r') || (ch < 0)) break;
[10]          if ((ch == '[') && (yytext[0] != '\\')) {
[11]            varsplit = yytext + len; /* keep looping so we get the *last* one */
             } else if (((ch == ':') || (ch == ']')) && (!varsplit) && (yytext[0] != '\\')) {
                 var_prevch = ch;
                 break;
             }
         }
         ...

```

At [5], the first non-separator character is read. Then, the loop at [6] is used to read the current variable name into `yytext`.

A new character is read [7], and if it matches “[” [8, 10], the `varsplit` pointer is set to the current location within `yytext` [9, 11]. This is used to keep a reference to the start of the range notation within the variable name.

At the start of the loop we can see a check for `len == T_MAX_STR`. The size of `yytext` is initially equal to `T_MAX_STR`. Whenever the number of characters written (tracked by `len`) reach `T_MAX_STR`, `yytext` is reallocated by doubling the current size, so that it’ll be able to fit the rest of the data.

The issue is that `realloc` may move the buffer to a completely different location. While `yytext` will be reallocated correctly, `varsplit` may now point to a portion of memory that has been freed (by `realloc`).

Keeping in mind that `varsplit` now points to freed memory, let’s see how the function continues after the loop:

```
         ...
         yytext[len] = 0; /* absolute terminator */
[12]     if ((varsplit) && (yytext[len - 1] == ']')) {
             char *vst;
[13]         vst = malloc_2(strlen(varsplit) + 1);
             strcpy(vst, varsplit);

[14]         *varsplit = 0x00; /* zero out var name at the left bracket */
[15]         len = varsplit - yytext;

[16]         varsplit = vsplitcurr = vst;
             var_prevch = 0;
         } else {
             varsplit = NULL;
         }

         if (match_kw)
             for (i = 0; i < NUM_VTOKENS; i++) {
                 if (!strcmp(yytext, vartypes[i])) {
                     return (varenums[i]);
                 }
             }

[17]     yylen = len;
         return (V_STRING);
     }

```

At [12], if the variable definition ends with “]” (end of the range definition), a new `vst` buffer is allocated [13], with a length of `strlen(varsplit)`. This is an out-of-bounds read that has limited consequences, as the `strcpy` that comes afterwards won’t be able to write out-of-bounds. At [14] however, a NULL byte is written to freed memory. This command may already overwrite heap metadata, depending on the heap implementation being used. Also note that it is possible to choose the offset where `varsplit` points within the old `yytext` buffer, so it is possible to precisely write the NULL byte in a specific spot within the current freed chunk’s metadata.

There is also another avenue for exploitation, since `len` is calculated as the difference between `varsplit` and `yytext` [15]. This difference depends on where the new `yytext` buffer is, but with careful heap manipulation, it can be set indirectly, by controlling the allocation for `yytext` when `realloc` is being called. We can thus assume at this point that we have some kind of control on `len` as well.

At [16], `varsplit` is set to point to `vst`, so from this point on it will point to a valid memory location.

Finally at [17], `yylen` is set to `len`. Upon return of this function, `yytext` should contain a text of size `yylen`. However as previously stated, this won’t be true, as `yylen` can be controlled thanks to the use-after-free on `varsplit`.

Back in the `T_VAR` case above, one usage of `get_vartoken` is for reading the symbol name:

```
[18] vtok = get_vartoken(0);
     if (vtok != V_STRING) goto err;
     if (slisthier_len) {
         v->name = (char *)malloc_2(slisthier_len + 1 + yylen + 1);
         strcpy(v->name, slisthier);
         strcpy(v->name + slisthier_len, vcd_hier_delimeter);
         strcpy(v->name + slisthier_len + 1, yytext);
     } else {
[19]     v->name = (char *)malloc_2(yylen + 1);
[20]     strcpy(v->name, yytext);
     }

```

At [18] `get_vartoken(0)` is called, which sets any arbitrary content in `yytext` (read from file) and also sets an arbitrary `yylen` (controlled via the use-after-free). If an attacker manages to set `yylen` to a small value (smaller than the length of `yytext`’s text), `v->name` will be created with a relatively small buffer [19], and the `strcpy` at [20] will write out-of-bounds.

For this reason, this issue has potential to be used to achieve arbitrary code execution.

As mentioned before, this issue affects all `vcd_parse` implementations (6 different source files), that we list separately below.

#### CVE-2023-37573 - VCD GUI recoder

The GUI’s recoder VCD parsing code (default parser) may use memory after it has been freed at line `vcd_recoder.c:1057`. This may lead to arbitrary code execution as described above.

This issue does not need any special command-line switch to be triggered when starting GTKWave.

#### CVE-2023-37574 - VCD GUI legacy

The GUI’s legacy VCD parsing code may use memory after it has been freed at line `vcd.c:552`. This may lead to arbitrary code execution as described above.

This issue can be triggered by using the `-L` flag when starting GTKWave.

#### CVE-2023-37575 - VCD GUI interactive

The GUI’s interactive VCD parsing code may use memory after it has been freed at line `vcd_partial.c:528`. This may lead to arbitrary code execution as described above.

This issue can be triggered by using the `-I` flag when starting GTKWave.

#### CVE-2023-37576 - vcd2vzt

The VCD parsing code in the `vcd2vzt` conversion utility may use memory after it has been freed at line `vcd2vzt.c:566`. This may lead to arbitrary code execution as described above.

#### CVE-2023-37577 - vcd2lxt2

The VCD parsing code in the `vcd2lxt2` conversion utility may use memory after it has been freed at line `vcd2lxt2.c:564`. This may lead to arbitrary code execution as described above.

#### CVE-2023-37578 - vcd2lxt

The VCD parsing code in the `vcd2lxt` conversion utility may use memory after it has been freed at line `vcd2lxt.c:559`. This may lead to arbitrary code execution as described above.
