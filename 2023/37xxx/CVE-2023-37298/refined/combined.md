Hello,

> SVG graphics are still supported via the IMG tag

what means this?

I have some svg in various notes, to display some pictures.

How can I display it again by using IMG tag? I need to save as resource and import in note?

Sorry, something went wrong.

Otherwise, could you suggest me where I can read something about this?
