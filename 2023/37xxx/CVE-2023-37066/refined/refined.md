{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when updating skill profile information. The code uses `Database::escape_string` before database update, but uses  `html_filter` to sanitize data before the update. This inconsistency can lead to stored XSS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient sanitization",
      "Inconsistent input sanitization",
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the profile name and description fields. This code will then be executed in the browsers of other users who view these profiles, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface, specifically when updating skill profile information via the `updateProfileInfo` or `save` functions.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a user with permissions to update skill profiles."
  }
