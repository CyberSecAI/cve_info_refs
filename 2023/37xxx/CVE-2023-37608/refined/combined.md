Those turnstiles are though and are made to last long. They are used indoors or outdoors.

[SECURITY DOORS](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/pedestrian-products/security-doors/)

## Vehicle products

Automatic Systems puts its 50 years of experience in the field of [vehicle barriers](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/vehicle-products/) at your disposal. We offer different categories, each one of them specially designed for its specific task. Such as toll, parking entrances or perimeter security and hostile vehicle mitigation.

### [PARKING](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/vehicle-products/parking/), [PERIMETER ACCESS](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/vehicle-products/perimeter-access/) AND [TOLL](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/vehicle-products/tollway/) BARRIERS

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.automatic-systems.com/ier-content/uploads/2017/10/ultra-fast-barriers-bl-229-toll-malaysia2.jpg)

For parking and perimeter access management, Automatic Systems offers the [BL 229](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/vehicle-products/perimeter-access/vehicle-barrier-3/bl-229-5/), [BL 227 EVO](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/produits-vehicules/barrieres-parking/barrieres-de-parking/bl-227/), [BL 244](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/vehicle-products/parking/parking-barrier/parkplus-244/) and [BL 44](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/vehicle-products/parking/vehicle-barrier-2/bl-44/), available with different types of boom arm.

Highway tolls require fast, robust and reliable barriers. For this purpose, Automatic Systems has created the specific barriers [BL 229 Toll](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/vehicle-products/tollway/vehicle-barrier/bl-229-toll/) and [BL 261](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/vehicle-products/tollway/tollplus/tollplus-261/).

### [LONG RANGE BARRIERS](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/vehicle-products/traffic-management/extra-long-barrier/)

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.automatic-systems.com/ier-content/uploads/2017/10/traffic-management-barrier-bl-45-france2.jpg)

We offer two models of long-range barriers. The [BL 52](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/vehicle-products/perimeter-access/vehicle-barrier-3/bl-52-4/) up to 14 meters in length and the [BL 45A/F](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/vehicle-products/traffic-management/extra-long-barrier/bl-45af/) up to 12 meters in length. They are perfect for controlling access to bridges, tunnels or other wide crossing routes.

### [FENCED BARRIERS](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/vehicle-products/perimeter-access/fenced-barrier/)

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.automatic-systems.com/ier-content/uploads/2017/10/heavy-duty-fenced-barrier-blg-77-canada.jpg)

For the securing of perimeters, we offer [fenced barriers](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/vehicle-products/perimeter-access/fenced-barrier/), which control access to both vehicles and pedestrians. These are made to resist vandalism and to protect sensitive areas. They are often used to restrict access to military bases, port and airport areas or other sites requiring a high level of security.

---

## [HIGH SECURITY PRODUCTS – Hostile vehicle mitigation](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/high-security/)

Our [high security](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/high-security/) and hostile vehicle mitigation (HVM) solutions ensure the protection of the most at risk areas and allow strict selective passage. We have security gates, bollards and retractable obstacles.

### [RISING BARRIERS](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/high-security/vertical-lift-or-rising-barriers/)

![BL43C50 high security barrier](data:image/svg+xml...)![BL43C50 high security barrier](https://www.automatic-systems.com/ier-content/uploads/2019/11/44849838135_87da058201_c.jpg)

Rising barriers are designed to withstand the heaviest impacts. The [BL43 C50](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/high-security/vertical-lift-or-rising-barriers/security/bl43-c50m1/) models can withstand a 1.5 T vehicle launched at 64 km/h. For even greater safety, the [BL M50](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/high-security/vertical-lift-or-rising-barriers/high-security-2/bl-m50-2/) is the solution. It is capable of withstanding impacts of up to 2 million joules, a 3.5T vehicle launched at 112 km/h.

### [ROAD BLOCKERS AND TYRE KILLERS](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/high-security/road-blockers-and-tyre-killers/)

![obstacle escamotable](data:image/svg+xml...)![obstacle escamotable](https://www.automatic-systems.com/ier-content/uploads/2018/08/rsb-charleroi-390x250-web.jpg)

Road blockers offer an alternative to barriers while offering the same levels of resistance. These obstacles can also be used in addition to barriers for optimal security. The [RSB C60SM](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/high-security/road-blockers-and-tyre-killers/security-2/rsb-c60sm/) is used for installations with medium security levels, while the [RSB M](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/high-security/road-blockers-and-tyre-killers/high-security-3/rsb-m50/) series is used for locations requiring a higher safety rate. [Tyre killers](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/high-security/road-blockers-and-tyre-killers/tyre-killers/tk-man/), manual or automatic are also at your disposal.

### [BOLLARDS](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/high-security/bollards/)

![bornes escamotables](data:image/svg+xml...)![bornes escamotables](https://www.automatic-systems.com/ier-content/uploads/2018/08/bornes-cat-web.jpg)

We have a wide variety of [bollards](https://www.automatic-systems.com/range/high-security/bollards/), offering solutions to all situations. Bollards have the advantage of being able to continue to operate even after an impact, as long as it does not exceed excessively the limit tolerable by the bollard. They are ideal when it comes to protecting large sensitive areas or pedestrian areas.
