- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application has an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when parsing a specially crafted PAR file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: By tricking a user to open a specially crafted PAR file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a malicious PAR file and convince a user to open it using the affected application. The attacker needs to have local access to the target system, and the user must interact with the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.
