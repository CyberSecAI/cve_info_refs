- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the server database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required for successful exploitation.
