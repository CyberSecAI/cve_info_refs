[`90b0df8`](/wintercms/winter/commit/90b0df82803836c26cb43f73760752b8c9295ab2)

## UX/UI Improvements

* Display an inspirational quote after generating code files with the `create:*` scaffolding commands, can be disabled by passing the `--uninspiring` option.
* `InvalidArgumentException` exceptions in scaffolding commands are now caught and displayed as an error in the console.
* Support for uploading SVGs is now present and enabled by default in the core. SVGs are sanitized on upload to avoid potential XSS attacks.
* Minor improvements to the backend brand settings page on mobile.
* Added a visual indicator to ignored packages when running `artisan mix:list`.
* Added ability to select the desired theme scaffold to use when scaffolding themes from the backend, also will now automatically pre-fill more fields.
* Migration messages will now be show when running migrations in the console, even if an exception is thrown.
* Finished implementing the `artisan create:migration` command, with support for the `--version`, `--create`, `--update`, `--table`, and `--model` options. This command supports generating the required versions in `updates/version.yaml` now as well.
* A default `.env.example` file is now included in the `wintercms/winter` repository.
* Fixed an issue where the `Clear` button on the `recordfinder` wasn't visible.

## API Changes

* Local extensions are now initialized after all behaviours have been loaded. See [wintercms/storm@004159](https://github.com/wintercms/storm/commit/a8ba4eef2e96851c5f2293f1fbf70047c3004159).
* Ignored Mix packages are now excluded from `MixAssets::getPackages()` unless the `$includeIgnored` argument is true.
* Added `getPluginVersions()` method to the `PluginBase` class to get a sorted list of the plugin's versions as defined in `updates/version.yaml`.
* `cms.beforeRoute` is now a halting event in order to enable preventing the CMS catch-all route from being registered.

## Bug Fixes

* When updating the sort\_order on sortable relations, `find()` is now called on the related model directly rather than the Relation object. See [wintercms/storm#146](https://github.com/wintercms/storm/commit/94a426f76dff251b8c10639490415806f034ee1a).
* Fixed issue preventing users from being able to create themes from the backend (Return value must be of type string, null returned).
* Fixed issue with case sensitivity when determining "upload\_max\_filesize" size.
* Fixed race condition with maxItem limit check after adding a new repeater item
* Fixed issue where keyboards could appear on mobile when attempting to use a datepicker field.
* Fixed issue where an error message was being logged unnecessarily.
* Fixed issue where dynamically switching between multiple themes on the same instance coud result in assets from the wrong theme being loaded.

## Security Improvements

* SVGs are now sanitized on upload to avoid potential XSS attacks. See [wintercms/winter#GHSA-wjw2-4j7j-6gc3](https://github.com/wintercms/winter/security/advisories/GHSA-wjw2-4j7j-6gc3).

## Translation Improvements

* Improved Hungarian translation.

## Community Improvements

* The [Winter.Blocks](https://github.com/wintercms/wn-blocks-plugin) plugin has been released, offering a visual, block-based content editor for Winter CMS.
* The [Winter.Ray](https://github.com/wintercms/wn-ray-plugin) plugin now supports loading the Ray configuration through the normal Winter CMS config system rather than requiring a `ray.php` file to be present in your project root.

## Dependencies

* `winter/storm` and `wintercms/winter` now include PHP 8.2 in their automated test suites.
* Support for `symfony/console` up to `6.3` has been added.

# Stored XSS through privileged upload of SVG file

Low

[LukeTowers](/LukeTowers)
published
GHSA-wjw2-4j7j-6gc3
Jul 7, 2023

## Package

composer

wintercms/wn-backend-module
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 1.2.3

## Patched versions

1.2.3

## Description

### Impact

Users with the `backend.manage_branding` permission can upload SVGs as the application logo. Previously, SVG uploads were not sanitized, which could have allowed a stored XSS attack.

Although this was a security issue, it's important to note that its severity is low. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would already need to have developer or super user level permissions in Winter CMS. This means they would already have extensive access and control within the system. Additionally, to execute the XSS, the attacker would need to convince the victim to directly visit the URL of the maliciously uploaded SVG, and the application would have to be using local storage where uploaded files are served under the same domain as the application itself instead of a CDN. This is because all SVGs in Winter CMS are rendered through an `img` tag, which prevents any payloads from being executed directly.

These two factors significantly limit the potential harm of this vulnerability. That being said, all users are advised to update to the latest version (1.2.3) to ensure their systems remain secure.

### Patches

This issue has been patched in v1.2.3 through the inclusion of full support for SVG uploads and automatic sanitization of uploaded SVG files.

### Workarounds

Apply [wintercms/storm@186d85d](https://github.com/wintercms/storm/commit/186d85d8fea2cae43afc807d39f68553c24e56be) & [fa50b4c](https://github.com/wintercms/winter/commit/fa50b4c7489b67ea80072f8ac9fe5294fce1df1c) manually if unable to upgrade to v1.2.3.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
