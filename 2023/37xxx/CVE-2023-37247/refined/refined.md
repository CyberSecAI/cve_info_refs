- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow while parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs when a user opens a malicious PAR file using the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PAR file. The attacker does not require any special privileges (PR:N) and the attack requires user interaction (UI:R).
