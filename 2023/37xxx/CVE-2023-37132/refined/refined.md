Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2023-37132:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The issue title was initially "Stored XSS exists in version 1.6.3, which can lead to stealing sensitive information of logged-in users", but was later changed to "123". This indicates a potential Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified.
- The comment by `SHfen9` includes the text "| 123 | The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered: |"

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The initial title indicates the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability. Stored XSS occurs when malicious scripts are injected and permanently stored on the target server (e.g., in a database), so the attacker doesn't have to repeatedly inject the script. The provided text does not provide the exact location but the comment implies that there is a data processing error.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Stealing sensitive information:** The initial title mentions that the XSS vulnerability can lead to stealing sensitive information of logged-in users. This means an attacker could potentially access cookies, session tokens, or other private data through the injected script.
- The vulnerability can also lead to other actions such as redirecting users to malicious sites or performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript into a field or input that gets stored in the application's data and rendered to other users. This is consistent with the nature of stored XSS vulnerabilities.
- The provided text does not clarify how or where the malicious script is injected.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to input or modify data that the application stores and renders to other users. This often requires authentication to an application with the vulnerable form or input.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was reported by user `SHfen9` and was closed by `weng-xianhu` as completed.
- While the content suggests a stored XSS vulnerability, the specific details of the injection point or how it was exploited are not fully described.
- The provided information includes a title change from a descriptive vulnerability to an unhelpful string, which is not uncommon when a fix is released or to make the public disclosure more difficult.

Based on this analysis, the provided content appears to be related to CVE-2023-37132.
