- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a restricted shell escape, allowing the bypass of command execution restrictions on an affected host via SSH.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the ability to bypass command restrictions, leading to arbitrary command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands, potentially leading to a compromise of the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through SSH.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires high privileges (PR:H) on the affected NetBackup Appliance to exploit this vulnerability.
