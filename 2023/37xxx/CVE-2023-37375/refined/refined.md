- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow while parsing specially crafted SPP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a specially crafted SPP file using the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious SPP file. The attacker does not need any special privileges.
