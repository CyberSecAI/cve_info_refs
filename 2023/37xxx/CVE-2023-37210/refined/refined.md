Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-37210:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability of a website to prevent a user from exiting fullscreen mode by using JavaScript `alert()` and `prompt()` calls within a `keydown` event handler.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Event Handling:** The core issue lies in how Firefox handles key events, specifically the F11 key (or equivalent) used to toggle fullscreen mode. When a JavaScript alert or prompt is triggered within a `keydown` event handler, Firefox incorrectly prevents the F11 key from exiting fullscreen. This is because the event is preventDefaulted within the content process due to document suppression during `alert()` calls. The parent process then ignores the preventDefaulted event and does not exit the fullscreen mode.
*   **Bypass of User Expectations:** Users expect to be able to exit fullscreen mode with the designated shortcut, regardless of web page actions. This behavior bypasses that expectation, leading to confusion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spoofing/Phishing:** A malicious website could trap a user in fullscreen mode while displaying a fake browser interface. This could make the user believe they are no longer in fullscreen mode or that they are interacting with a legitimate system interface.
*   **User Confusion:** Users may become disoriented or confused when they are unable to exit fullscreen mode in the normal way.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Page:** The attacker must host a malicious web page which contains the vulnerable code and can trigger a full-screen mode.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to visit the page and enter fullscreen mode, typically by pressing F11 or a similar shortcut.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have control over a website accessible to the victim.
*   The attacker needs to write JavaScript code that uses `alert()` or `prompt()` calls within the `keydown` event handler, preventing the default action of exiting fullscreen when the user presses F11.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring that keyboard events for exiting fullscreen mode are not dispatched to the web page when the browser is in fullscreen mode and therefore, cannot be prevented by the web page.
*   The fix involved changes to the way Firefox handles shortcut keys related to fullscreen mode, including disabling relevant `<key>` elements when in fullscreen mode.
* The bug report also mentions that Chrome behaves differently on MacOS, where the shortcut key for entering fullscreen mode is fn+F, but this shortcut cannot be prevented by a web page, which is similar to the behavior desired with the fix in Firefox.
