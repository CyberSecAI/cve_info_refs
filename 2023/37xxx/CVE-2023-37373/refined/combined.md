GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM CROSSBOW is a secure access management solution designed to provide NERC CIP
compliant access to Intelligent Electronic Devices.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
