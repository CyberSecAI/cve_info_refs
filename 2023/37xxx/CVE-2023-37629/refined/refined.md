Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-37629

**Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated File Upload

**Product:** Online Piggery Management System - 1.0

**Root Cause:** The `add-pig.php` script allows unauthenticated users to upload files without proper validation or sanitization. Specifically, the code uses `move_uploaded_file` directly with the user-supplied filename and does not enforce any restrictions on the file type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The vulnerability exists because the application does not require authentication before allowing file uploads via `add-pig.php`.
*   **Lack of File Type Validation:** The application does not validate the uploaded file type or extension. The code utilizes `basename` but this doesn't prevent malicious file uploads.
*   **Direct Use of User-Supplied Filename:** The application directly uses the filename provided by the user in the POST request and doesn't sanitize or validate it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can achieve RCE on the server. This allows them to execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining control of the server, accessing sensitive data, or causing further harm to the system and its users.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to the compromise of the web server.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially manipulate data within the database.
*   **Website Defacement:** An attacker could upload malicious code to deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted POST request to `add-pig.php` with the malicious file in the `pigphoto` parameter.
*   **Unrestricted Access:** The attacker does not need any user credentials or special permissions to upload files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable file path (`add-pig.php`).
*   **Ability to craft HTTP POST Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests containing a malicious file upload.

**Additional Details from the Github PoC:**
* The github repository contains a proof of concept demonstrating this vulnerability using a crafted HTTP request.
* The PoC image visually shows the successful upload of a php file.
