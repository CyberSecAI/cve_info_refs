# Mirth Connect <= 4.3.0 Unauth RCE

  [2 August 2023](https://www.ihteam.net/advisory/mirth-connect/)
* [2 Comments on Mirth Connect <= 4.3.0 Unauth RCE](https://www.ihteam.net/advisory/mirth-connect/#comments)

## TL;DR

IHTeam undertook an independent security assessment of NextGen’s Mirth Connect version <= 4.3.0 and identified the following vulnerability:

* CVE-2023-37679 – Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution

## What’s Mirth Connect

Mirth Connect (<https://github.com/nextgenhealthcare/connect>) is an opensource healthcare data integration system, that enables the management of information using bi-directional sending of many types of messages. The primary use of this interface engine is in healthcare.

## CVE-2023-37679

IHTeam identified a remote command execution on Mirth Connect <= 4.3.0 that can be exploited from an unauthenticated perspective. The only condition in which this CVE can be exploited is when JRE <= 8.0 is in use.

It should also be noted that, by default, the server starts with administrative privileges (root or SYSTEM), therefore the remote command execution will have a more serious impact.

The issue is affecting all version of the product (Linux, Windows and MacOS). The root cause was one of the internal servlet filters in the Mirth Connect’s code-base (not caused by any of the third-party components).

Version 4.4.0 resolved this issue and the vendor will soon stop supporting JRE 8.0 in favour of newer versions. Additional information can be consulted in the Changelog here: [https://github.com/nextgenhealthcare/connect/wiki/4.4.0—What’s-New#remote-code-execution-vulnerability-when-using-java-8-and-elevated-permissions](https://github.com/nextgenhealthcare/connect/wiki/4.4.0---What%27s-New#remote-code-execution-vulnerability-when-using-java-8-and-elevated-permissions)

## Proof of Concept

The proof of concept request will never be released to avoid ransomware attacks on public healthcare systems. And also considering the fact that, although the management interface shouldn’t be exposed on the Internet, there are currently around 2000 systems in Shodan: <https://www.shodan.io/search?query=title%3A%22Mirth+Connect+Administrator%22>

Will blocking ports 8080 and 8443 at the firewall mitigate the issue?

Hi, I updated the article saying that a proof of concept will not be released to avoid ransomware attacks on public healthcare systems.

A Mobile EHR
With a mobile extension of your practice, you give providers an easier way to work, from anywhere. The access enabled by a mobile EHR means you can treat patients anywhere—and all documentation flows into the patient chart automatically.

The right data now
Securely exchange health information and connect disparate systems across a patient’s entire spectrum of care, easily. Better interoperability is defined by capabilities that boost speed, security, cost-effectiveness, and compliance. Get the data you need when and where you need it.

Secure hosting with AWS
Focus on patient care, not IT management. Scalable, cloud-based hosting services can help reduce the burden of health IT maintenance, speed implementations, simplify upgrades, and cut technology costs. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer world-class security capabilities and system performance.
