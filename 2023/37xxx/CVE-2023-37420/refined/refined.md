Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-37420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `parse_valuechange` function within the `vcd2lxt` utility of GTKWave, specifically within the handling of "port dump" values.
*   The code incorrectly checks if a buffer (`vector`) needs reallocation before copying data into it. It compares the current buffer size (`yylen_cache`) with the required size (`v->size`) but fails to account for the null terminator. This allows a single-byte heap-based out-of-bounds write during a `strcpy` operation at `src/helpers/vcd2lxt.c:928`
*   The check at [24] `if (yylen_cache < v->size)` should have been  `if (yylen_cache <= v->size)`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow (out-of-bounds write):** Due to the incorrect buffer size check, a null byte is written beyond the allocated memory boundary of the `vector` buffer. This occurs when copying `v->value` into `vector`.
*   The `v->size` value is attacker-controlled through the input .vcd file, allowing manipulation of buffer sizes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The out-of-bounds write can be leveraged to overwrite adjacent heap metadata. With careful manipulation of heap layout (heap massaging), this can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious VCD File:** An attacker can craft a malicious `.vcd` file that, when opened with the vulnerable GTKWave utility (`vcd2lxt`), triggers the out-of-bounds write in the heap memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide the victim with a malicious .vcd file
*   The victim must then open the malicious file with the vulnerable `vcd2lxt` utility.
*   The attacker needs some knowledge of heap layout and how to control it via the contents of the .vcd file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `vcd_parse` function, which is used by different GTKWave utilities.
*   This specific CVE (CVE-2023-37420) relates to the `vcd2lxt` utility. Other closely related CVEs cover similar vulnerabilities in other GTKWave utilities and GUI implementations.
*   The provided crash information shows an AddressSanitizer error, confirming the heap-based buffer overflow.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in GTKWave version 3.3.118.
*   Debian LTS advisory DLA-3785-1 addresses this CVE, along with a large number of other vulnerabilities, by updating the `gtkwave` package to version 3.3.98+really3.3.118-0+deb10u1.

**Summary**

CVE-2023-37420 describes a heap-based out-of-bounds write in the `vcd2lxt` utility of GTKWave. By crafting a malicious .vcd file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability when the file is opened with the vulnerable tool. Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution.
