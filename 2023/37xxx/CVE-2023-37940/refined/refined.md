- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Service Class" text field within the edit Service Access Policy page. Specifically, the application does not adequately prevent the inclusion of malicious scripts or HTML tags.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML within the context of the vulnerable web page. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Phishing attacks
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection of users to malicious sites
    - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting a crafted payload containing malicious scripts into the Service Class text field of a service access policy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H) within the Liferay Portal or DXP instance to edit a Service Access Policy. The user interaction (UI) is required, as the attacker needs to perform an action with the malicious payload.
