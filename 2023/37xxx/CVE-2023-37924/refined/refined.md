Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-37924:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in Apache Submarine.
- The root cause is the use of a vulnerable `like` statement within the MyBatis framework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input in a `like` statement used in MyBatis.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-  An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code into the `like` clause.
- This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered through the `like` statement in the MyBatis.
- An attacker would likely need to inject malicious SQL code into user-controllable parameters that are used in constructing the vulnerable query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to provide malicious input that is used in the vulnerable SQL query. 
- The attacker would need to have knowledge of how the vulnerable `like` statement is being constructed to craft a successful SQL injection attack.

**Mitigation:**

- The fix implemented was to replace the vulnerable `like` statement with `concat('%', #{param}, '%')`, which uses parameter binding to prevent SQL injection.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in versions 0.7.0 and 0.8.0 of Apache Submarine.
- The fix is included in version 0.8.0.
- A pull request ([#1037](https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1037)) was created to address this issue and has been merged.
- A test case verification code was added in `submarine-server/server-database/src/test/java/org/apache/submarine/server/database/workbench/database/service/SysUserServiceTest.java` to prevent future regressions.
