- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user input in the username field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the username field. When reports containing the injected script are loaded, the script will be executed. This can lead to data exfiltration, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Injection of malicious JavaScript through the username field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to input data into the username field of the affected application.
