Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-37949:

**Vulnerability:** Missing permission check in Orka by MacStadium Plugin allows capturing credentials

**Root Cause:** The Orka by MacStadium Plugin does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Permission Check:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of a permission check on an HTTP endpoint within the plugin. This allows unauthorized access to a sensitive function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credential Capture:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method. This allows them to capture credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based, as it involves sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Exploitation of Plugin Endpoint:** Attackers target a specific HTTP endpoint in the Orka by MacStadium plugin that lacks the proper permission checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Overall/Read Permission:** Attackers require Overall/Read permissions within the Jenkins environment. This level of permission is generally granted to users with basic access to Jenkins, meaning the attack is not limited to high-privilege users.
*   **Knowledge of Credentials IDs:** Attackers need to have obtained credential IDs through another method to specify the credentials they want to capture.
