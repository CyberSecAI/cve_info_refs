The provided content describes a command injection vulnerability in Tenda AC10 (V15.03.06.26) firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `formWriteFacMac` function in the Tenda AC10 firmware passes user-controlled input from the `mac` parameter directly to the `doSystemCmd` function, which executes the input as a system command, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection due to the lack of sanitization of the `mac` parameter before passing it to the `doSystemCmd` function, allowing execution of arbitrary system commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary command execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the router, which can lead to complete control of the device, information disclosure, denial of service, and potentially lateral movement.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/goform/WriteFacMac` endpoint, with the malicious command embedded within the `mac` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network access to the router:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Tenda AC10 router.
*   **Authentication:** The provided POC includes a `Cookie: password=caw5gk`, which suggests that authentication is required.
