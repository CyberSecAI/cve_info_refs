# Tenda AC10 (V15.03.06.26) has an command injection vulnerability

## Overview

* Manufacturer's website information：[https://www.tenda.com.cn](https://www.tenda.com.cn/)
* Firmware download address ： <https://www.tenda.com.cn/download/detail-2939.html>

[![image-20230626111309201](https://github.com/DaDong-G/Vulnerability_info/raw/main/ac10_command_injection/img/image-20230626111309201.png)](https://github.com/DaDong-G/Vulnerability_info/blob/main/ac10_command_injection/img/image-20230626111309201.png)

## Vulnerability details

The Tenda AC10 (V15.03.06.26) was found to contain a command insertion vulnerability in formWriteFacMac.This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands through the "mac" parameter.

[![image-20230626112223748](https://github.com/DaDong-G/Vulnerability_info/raw/main/ac10_command_injection/img/image-20230626112223748.png)](https://github.com/DaDong-G/Vulnerability_info/blob/main/ac10_command_injection/img/image-20230626112223748.png)

The `mac`(the value of `mac`) we entered will be passed into the `doSystemCmd` function as a parameter.

[![image-20230626112259807](https://github.com/DaDong-G/Vulnerability_info/raw/main/ac10_command_injection/img/image-20230626112259807.png)](https://github.com/DaDong-G/Vulnerability_info/blob/main/ac10_command_injection/img/image-20230626112259807.png)

Reverse analysis found that the function was called directly through the system function, which has a command injection vulnerability.
