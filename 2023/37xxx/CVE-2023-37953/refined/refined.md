Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-37953:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-37953

**Vulnerability:** Missing permission check in mabl Plugin

**Root Cause:** The mabl Plugin (version 0.0.46 and earlier) does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Missing Permission Check:** Several HTTP endpoints within the mabl Plugin lack proper permission checks.
*   **CSRF:** The affected endpoints do not require POST requests, making them vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credential Capture:** Attackers can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credential IDs. This allows them to capture credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** An attacker can send malicious HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker can trick a user into sending malicious requests by using CSRF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Overall/Read Permission:** Attackers need Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins to exploit the missing permission check vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Obtain Credentials IDs:** Attackers need to know the credential IDs, which could be obtained through other vulnerabilities, like CVE-2023-37950
*   **Victim Interaction (CSRF):** For exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, the attacker needs to trick a victim into accessing a malicious URL, which in turn would make a request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a set of vulnerabilities identified in the mabl plugin, also including CVE-2023-37952
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 0.0.47 of the mabl Plugin, which requires POST requests and proper permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.
