# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1807

## GTKWave VCD sorted bsearch arbitrary write vulnerabilities

##### January 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-37921,CVE-2023-37923,CVE-2023-37922

##### SUMMARY

Multiple arbitrary write vulnerabilities exist in the VCD sorted bsearch functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115. A specially crafted .vcd file can lead to arbitrary code execution. A victim would need to open a malicious file to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

GTKWave 3.3.115

##### PRODUCT URLS

GTKWave - <https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-118 - Incorrect Access of Indexable Resource (‘Range Error’)

##### DETAILS

GTKWave is a wave viewer, often used to analyze FPGA simulations and logic analyzer captures. It includes a GUI to view and analyze traces, as well as convert across several file formats (`.lxt`, `.lxt2`, `.vzt`, `.fst`, `.ghw`, `.vcd`, `.evcd`) either by using the UI or its command line tools. GTKWave is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS. Trace files can be shared within teams or organizations, for example to compare results of simulation runs across different design implementations, to analyze protocols captured with logic analyzers or just as a reference when porting design implementations.

GTKWave sets up mime types for its supported extensions.

VCD (Value Change Dump) files are parsed by the `vcd_parse` function. This function is duplicated in several conversion utilities (`vcd2lxt`, `vcd2lxt2`, `vcd2vzt`) but not in the GUI parsers of GTKWave. In general the various implementations are very similar or identical, but in some cases they differ enough to not allow the issue described in this advisory to be triggered.

Let’s describe the execution flow for the `vcd2lxt` utility; the other implementations have very similar behavior.

The function `vcd_parse` loops over each line in the file [1]. Depending on which token has been read [2], a different switch block is executed:

```
     static void vcd_parse(int linear) {
         int tok;

[1]      for (;;) {
[2]          switch (get_token()) {
                 ...

```

The `get_token()` function simply extracts a token from the file at the current cursor position, saving it to the global `yytext` buffer, and assigning the token’s length to the global `yylen`.

Moreover, if the token does not start with “$”, the token is considered a special symbol, and it has to match one of these tokens:

```
char *tokens[] = {"var", "end", "scope", "upscope",
                  "comment", "date", "dumpall", "dumpoff", "dumpon",
                  "dumpvars", "enddefinitions",
                  "dumpports", "dumpportsoff", "dumpportson", "dumpportsall",
                  "timescale", "version", "vcdclose", "timezero",
                  "", "", ""};

```

The return value of `get_token` is a token type, which is an index inside the `tokens` array above.

If the token does not start with “$”, the token is considered a string and the returned token type will be `T_STRING`.

Going back to the `switch` above, if the parsed token is “$var”, the token type will be `T_VAR` and we will enter the block at [3]:

```
[3]  case T_VAR: {
         int vtok;
         struct vcdsymbol *v = NULL;

         var_prevch = 0;
         ...
[4]      vtok = get_vartoken(1);

```

A new token is read using `get_vartoken()` [5] and saved into `vtok`.

This function, similarly to `get_token()`, extracts a token from the file, separated by any of “ “, “\t”, “\n”, or “\r”.

If `match_kw` (the first argument to the function) is 1, then the token is matched against the `vartypes` array and the return value is set to the matching index inside it:

```
static char *vartypes[] = {"event", "parameter",
                           "integer", "real", "real_parameter", "realtime", "string", "reg", "supply0",
                           "supply1", "time", "tri", "triand", "trior",
                           "trireg", "tri0", "tri1", "wand", "wire", "wor", "port", "in", "out", "inout",
                           "$end", "", "", "", ""};

```

Going on with the `T_VAR` case. Our token needs to be “port” or any of the other symbols before it [5]:

```
         ...
[5]      if (vtok > V_PORT) goto bail;

[6]      v = (struct vcdsymbol *)calloc_2(1, sizeof(struct vcdsymbol));
         v->vartype = vtok;
         v->msi = v->lsi = vcd_explicit_zero_subscripts; /* indicate [un]subscripted status */

         if (vtok == V_PORT) {
             ...
         } else /* regular vcd var, not an evcd port var */
         {
[7]          vtok = get_vartoken(1);
             if (vtok == V_END) goto err;
[7]          v->size = atoi_64(yytext);
[8]          vtok = get_strtoken();
             if (vtok == V_END) goto err;
             v->id = (char *)malloc_2(yylen + 1);
[8]          strcpy(v->id, yytext);
             v->nid = vcdid_hash(yytext, yylen);

             if (v->nid < vcd_minid) vcd_minid = v->nid;
             if (v->nid > vcd_maxid) vcd_maxid = v->nid;

[9]          vtok = get_vartoken(0);
             if (vtok != V_STRING) goto err;
             if (slisthier_len) {
                ...
             } else {
                 v->name = (char *)malloc_2(yylen + 1);
[9]              strcpy(v->name, yytext);
             }

[10]         vtok = get_vartoken(1);
             if (vtok == V_END) goto dumpv;
             ...
         }

```

A series of tokens is then extracted to populate the `vcdsymbol` pointed by `v` [6], in this order:

* [7] v->size (integer) is the size of this symbol
* [8] v->id is a string representing the symbol ID
* [9] v->name is a string representing the name of this symbol
* [10] the declaration must end with the string “$end”

The code then continues by populating `v->value` and `v->narray`:

```
     dumpv:
         ...

         /* initial conditions */
[11]     v->value = (char *)malloc_2(v->size + 1);
         v->value[v->size] = 0;
         v->narray = (struct Node **)calloc_2(v->size, sizeof(struct Node *));
         {
             int i;
             for (i = 0; i < v->size; i++) {
[12]             v->value[i] = 'x';

                 v->narray[i] = (struct Node *)calloc_2(1, sizeof(struct Node));
                 v->narray[i]->head.time = -1;
                 v->narray[i]->head.v.val = 1;
             }
         }

         ...

[13]    if (!vcdsymroot) {
            vcdsymroot = vcdsymcurr = v;
        } else {
            vcdsymcurr->next = v;
            vcdsymcurr = v;
        }
        numsyms++;

         ...

     bail:
         if (vtok != V_END) sync_end(NULL);
         break;
     }

```

`v->value` is allocated with a size of `v->size + 1` [11], then it is initialized with “x” characters [12] and null-terminated.

Finally, the new `v` symbol is added to the symbols list [13] and `numsyms` is incremented. Here the case block ends and we go back to the loop at [1].

By defining variables using `$var`, we can create an arbitrary number of vcd symbols (as many as they can fit in memory), and `numsyms` increments accordingly without a limit.

After all variables are declared, “$enddefinitions” is read, which let us enter the switch block at [14]:

```
[14] case T_ENDDEFINITIONS:
         if (!header_over) {
[15]         header_over = 1; /* do symbol table management here */
[16]         create_sorted_table();
             if ((!sorted) && (!indexed)) {
                 fprintf(stderr, "No symbols in VCD file..nothing to do!\n");
                 exit(1);
             }

             if (linear) lt_set_no_interlace(lt);
         }
         break;

```

At [15], the variable `header_over` is set to 1. This is important, because this variable must be set to 1 in order to call the `parse_valuechange()` function in the next step.

As the variable definition has completed, the function `create_sorted_table()` is called to store all vcd symbols in an index for faster access [16].

```
     static void create_sorted_table(void) {
         struct vcdsymbol *v;
         struct vcdsymbol **pnt;
         unsigned int vcd_distance;
         struct vcdsymbol *root_v;
         int i;

         if (numsyms) {
[17]         vcd_distance = vcd_maxid - vcd_minid + 1;

[18]         if (vcd_distance <= 8 * 1024 * 1024) {
[19]             indexed = (struct vcdsymbol **)calloc_2(vcd_distance, sizeof(struct vcdsymbol *));

                 printf("%d symbols span ID range of %d, using indexing...\n", numsyms, vcd_distance);

                 v = vcdsymroot;
                 while (v) {
                     if (!(root_v = indexed[v->nid - vcd_minid])) {
                         indexed[v->nid - vcd_minid] = v;
                     }
                     alias_vs_normal_symadd(v, root_v);

                     v = v->next;
                 }
[20]         } else {
                 pnt = sorted = (struct vcdsymbol **)calloc_2(numsyms, sizeof(struct vcdsymbol *));
                 v = vcdsymroot;
                 while (v) {
                     *(pnt++) = v;
                     v = v->next;
                 }

                 qsort(sorted, numsyms, sizeof(struct vcdsymbol *), vcdsymcompare);

                 ...
         }
     }

```

At [17], the difference between `vcd_maxid` and `vcd_minid` is calculated. If two variables with symbols “A” and “AAAAA” were declared, their distance will be very big: `0x9b3890cb - 0x21 + 1`. If the distance is smaller than ~8 millions [18], `create_sorted_table` will create a simple hash table in `indexed` [19] so symbols can be retrieved directly, after computing the `vcd_hash` of the symbol to look up. The size of this table is at maximum `8 * 1024 * 1024 * sizeof(void *)`, so 32 MB for 32-bit code and 64 MB for 64-bit code.

If instead the distance is too big [20], a sorted array is created in `sorted`.

At this point, we go back to the loop at [1].

The next token is read. If it’s a string, we enter the switch block at [21].

```
     case T_STRING:
[21]     if (header_over) {
             /* catchall for events when header over */
[22]         if (yytext[0] == '#') {
                ...
             } else {
[23]             parse_valuechange();
             }
         }
         break;

```

If `header_over` is 1 [21] and the string does not start with “#” [22], the function `parse_valuechange()` is called.

```
     static void parse_valuechange(void) {
         struct vcdsymbol *v;
         char *vector;
         int vlen;

         switch (yytext[0]) {
             ...
[24]         case 'p':
                 /* extract port dump value.. */
[25]             vector = malloc_2(yylen_cache = yylen);
                 strcpy(vector, yytext + 1);
                 vlen = yylen - 1;

[26]             get_strtoken(); /* throw away 0_strength_component */
                 get_strtoken(); /* throw away 0_strength_component */
                 get_strtoken(); /* this is the id                  */
[27]             v = bsearch_vcd(yytext, yylen);
                 if (!v) {
                     fprintf(stderr, "Near line %d, Unknown identifier: '%s'\n", vcdlineno, yytext);
                     free_2(vector);
                 } else {
[28]                 if (vlen < v->size) /* fill in left part */
                     {
                         char extend;
                         int i, fill;

                         extend = '0';

                         fill = v->size - vlen;
[29]                     for (i = 0; i < fill; i++) {
[30]                         v->value[i] = extend;
                         }
                         evcd_strcpy(v->value + fill, vector);
                     }
                     ...
     }

```

If the token starts with the letter “p”, we enter the block at [24].

The array `vector` is allocated to store the string after “p” [25].

Two tokens are then extracted and discarded [26]. Finally, the `id` token is extracted and searched for in the `vcdsymbol`’s list [27] using `bsearch_vcd`. If found, the resulting `vcdsymbol` is then pointed by `v`.

If the symbol has been found, we reach [28]. Here, if `vlen` is smaller than `v->size`, this means that the string in vector is not big enough to fill the whole `v->value` buffer, which is thus padded with zeros. Note that the loop that does the padding is controlled by the symbol’s size `v->size`.

It’s important to keep in mind that `bsearch_vcd` [27] returns a `vcdsymbol`, that, if arbitrarily controlled, allows for easily writing arbitrary memory. `v->size` is controlled, so the loop at [29] can write an arbitrary number of zeros to `v->value`, which is a pointer stored inside the `vcdsymbol`.

Indeed, `bsearch_vcd` presents an issue that allows for an arbitrary `vcdsymbol` to be returned:

```
     static struct vcdsymbol *bsearch_vcd(char *key, int len) {
         struct vcdsymbol **v;
         struct vcdsymbol *t;

[31]     if (indexed) {
[32]         unsigned int hsh = vcdid_hash(key, len);
[33]         if ((hsh >= vcd_minid) && (hsh <= vcd_maxid)) {
                 return (indexed[hsh - vcd_minid]);
             }
         }

[34]     v = (struct vcdsymbol **)bsearch(key, sorted, numsyms,
                                          sizeof(struct vcdsymbol *), vcdsymbsearchcompare);

         if (v) {
     #ifndef VCD_BSEARCH_IS_PERFECT
             for (;;) {
                 t = *v;

                 if ((v == sorted) || (strcmp((*(--v))->id, key))) {
                     return (t);
                 }
             }
     #else
             return (*v);
     #endif
         } else {
             return (NULL);
         }
     }

```

Let’s assume that we have a .vcd file with 0x20000 (131072) “$var” declarations, all with the same id “x”, and one port dump line:

```
$var reg 2 x x $end
... 0x20000 times ...
$var reg 2 x x $end

$enddefinitions
p a a A

```

In this case `vcd_minid` and `vcd_maxid` will be equal because there’s only one hash (the one for the symbol “x”). Also, when “$enddefinitions” was called, `create_sorted_table()` filled the `indexed` hash table (as there is only one hash), and `sorted` would be left to 0 (its initialization value).

The 0x20000 “$var” declarations increment the `numsyms` value to 0x20000. Then, the `p` line is parsed, leading to the call `bsearch_vcd("A", 1)` to look the symbol up.

At [31], `indexed` is indeed not 0, so the hash for “A” is calculated [32]. However, it won’t be within `vcd_minid` and `vcd_maxid` [33].

The code does not return and executes the command [34], calling `bsearch` on the `sorted` array. Here the code is simply missing a null check against `sorted`.

`bsearch` is called with `sorted` set to 0, and `numsyms` set to 0x20000.

Let’s see glibc’s `bsearch` implementation:

```
     __extern_inline void *
     bsearch (const void *__key, const void *__base, size_t __nmemb, size_t __size, __compar_fn_t __compar)
     {
       size_t __l, __u, __idx;
       const void *__p;
       int __comparison;

       __l = 0;
       __u = __nmemb;
       while (__l < __u)
         {
[35]       __idx = (__l + __u) / 2;
[36]       __p = (void *) (((const char *) __base) + (__idx * __size));
[37]       __comparison = (*__compar) (__key, __p);
           if (__comparison < 0)
         __u = __idx;
           else if (__comparison > 0)
         __l = __idx + 1;
           else
         return (void *) __p;
         }

       return NULL;
     }

```

As expected, as `bsearch` is doing a binary search, it’s assuming that `sorted` points to a buffer of size `numsyms * sizeof(struct vcdsymbol *)`. In our example, assuming we’re executing in 32-bit mode, that would be 0x80000. At [35], the middle of this buffer is calculated and `__p` (the element to compare) is taken from `sorted` [36], which means it’s accessing an element at address 0x40000.

Finally it calls the `__compar` function `vcdsymbsearchcompare`:

```
     static int vcdsymbsearchcompare(const void *s1, const void *s2) {
         char *v1;
         struct vcdsymbol *v2;

         v1 = (char *)s1;
[38]     v2 = *((struct vcdsymbol **)s2);

         return (strcmp(v1, v2->id));
     }

```

At [38] the address 0x40000 is dereferenced, looking for a `vcdsymbol`, which is then returned if `v2->id` matches “A”. If an attacker controls the content of address 0x40000 (or any other, depending on the value set by `numsyms`, which is controllable by the number of “$var” definitions), they can return a `vcdsymbol` structure with arbitrary contents, leading to the arbitrary write described earlier [30]. This, in turn, could lead to arbitrary code execution. As this is a parser with few limitations on sizes and number of elements, controlling the content of arbitrary addresses, especially in 32-bit mode, may be achieved by carefully manipulating heap allocations.

As mentioned before, this issue affects 3 different source files, listed separately below.

#### CVE-2023-37921 - vcd2vzt

The `vcd2vzt` conversion utility does not check if the `sorted` buffer is initialized before calling `bsearch` at line `src/helpers/vcd2vzt.c:206`, leading to an arbitrary read which could be turned into an arbitrary write.

#### CVE-2023-37922 - vcd2lxt2

The `vcd2lxt2` conversion utility does not check if the `sorted` buffer is initialized before calling `bsearch` at line `src/helpers/vcd2lxt2.c:204`, leading to an arbitrary read which could be turned into an arbitrary write.

#### CVE-2023-37923 - vcd2lxt

The `vcd2lxt` conversion utility does not check if the `sorted` buffer is initialized before calling `bsearch` at line `src/helpers/vcd2lxt.c:198`, leading to an arbitrary read which could be turned into an arbitrary write.
