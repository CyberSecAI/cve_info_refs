## Description

### Impact

The 'update' functionality of the PJSIP\_HEADER dialplan function can exceed the available buffer space for storing the new value of a header. By doing so this can overwrite memory or cause a crash. This is not externally exploitable, unless dialplan is explicitly written to update a header based on data from an outside source. If the 'update' functionality is not used the vulnerability does not occur.

res\_pjsip\_header\_funcs: Duplicate new header value, don't copy.

```
When updating an existing header the 'update' code incorrectly
just copied the new value into the existing buffer. If the
new value exceeded the available buffer size memory outside
of the buffer would be written into, potentially causing
a crash.

This change makes it so that the 'update' now duplicates
the new header value instead of copying it into the existing
buffer.

CVE ID         : CVE-2023-37457 CVE-2023-38703 CVE-2023-49294 CVE-2023-49786
Debian Bug     : 1059303 1059032 1059033

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Asterisk, an Open
Source Private Branch Exchange.

CVE-2023-37457

    The 'update' functionality of the PJSIP_HEADER dialplan function can exceed
    the available buffer space for storing the new value of a header. By doing
    so this can overwrite memory or cause a crash. This is not externally
    exploitable, unless dialplan is explicitly written to update a header based
    on data from an outside source. If the 'update' functionality is not used
    the vulnerability does not occur.

CVE-2023-38703

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
    C with high level API in C, C++, Java, C#, and Python languages. SRTP is a
    higher level media transport which is stacked upon a lower level media
    transport such as UDP and ICE. Currently a higher level transport is not
    synchronized with its lower level transport that may introduce a
    use-after-free issue. This vulnerability affects applications that have
    SRTP capability (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media
    transport other than UDP. This vulnerability’s impact may range from
    unexpected application termination to control flow hijack/memory
    corruption.

CVE-2023-49294

    It is possible to read any arbitrary file even when the `live_dangerously`
    option is not enabled.

CVE-2023-49786

   Asterisk is susceptible to a DoS due to a race condition in the hello
   handshake phase of the DTLS protocol when handling DTLS-SRTP for media
   setup. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP
   encrypted calls during the attack. Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to
   a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable Asterisk servers for calls that
   rely on DTLS-SRTP.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

For the detailed security status of asterisk please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/asterisk>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
