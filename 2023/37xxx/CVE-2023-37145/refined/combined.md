## Vulnerability details

TOTOLINK LR350 (V9.3.5u.6369\_B20220309) was found to contain a command insertion vulnerability in setOpModeCfg.This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands through the "hostName" parameter.

The first step is to enter the 423970 function:

[![1687836029177](https://github.com/DaDong-G/Vulnerability_info/raw/main/TOTOLINK/lr350/1/img/1687836029177.jpg)](https://github.com/DaDong-G/Vulnerability_info/blob/main/TOTOLINK/lr350/1/img/1687836029177.jpg)

The picture below is sub\_41FED8:

[![1687836094591](https://github.com/DaDong-G/Vulnerability_info/raw/main/TOTOLINK/lr350/1/img/1687836094591.jpg)](https://github.com/DaDong-G/Vulnerability_info/blob/main/TOTOLINK/lr350/1/img/1687836094591.jpg)

By calling these functions, we can ultimately call `sub_423970` function (as shown in the last picture). By setting the proto value to 1, we can reach the default branch.`V48` passes directly into the `doSystem` function.

[![1687836187054](https://github.com/DaDong-G/Vulnerability_info/raw/main/TOTOLINK/lr350/1/img/1687836187054.png)](https://github.com/DaDong-G/Vulnerability_info/blob/main/TOTOLINK/lr350/1/img/1687836187054.png)

Reverse analysis found that the function was called directly through the `system` function, which has a command injection vulnerability.

## Recurring vulnerabilities and POC

In order to reproduce the vulnerability, the following steps can be followed:
