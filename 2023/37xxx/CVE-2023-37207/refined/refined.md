Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-37207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the ability of a website to obscure the fullscreen notification in Firefox by simultaneously triggering a fullscreen request and opening a URL with a scheme handled by an external application (e.g., a "mailto:" URL).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Prioritization of Fullscreen Notification:** Firefox did not prioritize the fullscreen notification over external applications launched via URI schemes.
- **Lack of Fullscreen Exit on External Protocol Trigger:**  Firefox did not automatically exit fullscreen mode when an external protocol was triggered by the webpage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Spoofing:** The obscured fullscreen notification can lead to user confusion, as they may not realize they are in fullscreen mode. This could be exploited to display spoofed content, potentially leading to phishing or other attacks where users might interact with a malicious webpage believing it's a legitimate full-screen application.
- **User Confusion:** Users may not realize they are interacting with a webpage in full-screen, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Website with Malicious Code:** An attacker would host a webpage containing HTML and JavaScript code designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to interact with the malicious webpage by clicking a link/button that triggers both the fullscreen and the external protocol launch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Web Hosting:** The attacker needs the ability to host a website.
- **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to entice the user to visit the malicious website and click on a specific element (e.g. a link or a button).
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to ensure that the fullscreen request and the external protocol launch occur simultaneously.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is not specific to Windows, as it was also reproducible on Ubuntu.
- The severity was initially considered moderate but there were arguments from the reporter for it to be raised to high due to the potential for spoofing attacks, especially on common resolutions where mail applications may open in maximized windows.
- The fix involves automatically exiting fullscreen mode whenever an external protocol is triggered, preventing the notification from being obscured.
