- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The RocketMQ NameServer component has a remote command execution vulnerability due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-33246. Specifically, the update configuration function can be exploited.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote command execution vulnerability via the NameServer's update configuration function. Lack of proper permission verification when NameServer addresses are exposed on the extranet.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands as the system user running RocketMQ on the NameServer.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to have access to the NameServer's address (especially if exposed on the extranet), and the vulnerability is triggered via the update configuration function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have network access to the NameServer and be able to send commands to it. No specific authentication or authorization is mentioned as a requirement for the exploit itself, only that the server must not properly verify permissions.
