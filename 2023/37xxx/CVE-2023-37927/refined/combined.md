## Summary

Multiple post-auth blind OS command and Python code injection vulnerabilities exist in the web management interface of some Zyxel NAS versions. These vulnerabilities could allow authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands or Python code on an affected device remotely. Attackers could leverage these vulnerabilities to perform unauthorized actions in the context of the WSGI server process running as `root` or the web server running as `nobody`.

## Details

## CVE-2023-37927 - OS command injection vulnerability in `storage_cgi`

The specific flaw exists within the implementation of the OS command execution mechanism via the `execRoot_bg2(cmd)` function within the `tools.py` component of the web management interface. Attackers can use a specially crafted `cmd` string to break out of the original command call and execute arbitrary Python code or OS commands in the context of the WSGI server running as `root`.

Our proprietary PRISâ¢ firmware analysis engine flagged a command injection vulnerability in function `FUN_00010568()` within the `executer_su` binary in the `/usr/local/apache/web_framework/bin` directory, as shown on *Figure 1*. The `FUN_00010568()` function calls the `execv()` function with user-provided input without validating or sanitizing it, potentially meaning that attackers could provide input containing shell commands that the program will execute, resulting in arbitrary remote command execution. As the name of the binary suggests, the purpose of this tool is the execution of OS commands in the context of the `root` user.

[![Figure 1. Zero-day scan result indicating a command injection vulnerability](/uploads/Figure01_FUN_10568_aa1043896e.png)

Figure 1. Zero-day scan result indicating a command injection vulnerability](/uploads/Figure01_FUN_10568_aa1043896e.png)

Further analysis revealed that the `execRoot_bg2(cmd)` function within the `tools.py` file in the `/usr/local/apache/web_framework/lib` directory invokes the analyzed `executer_su` binary. The vulnerability exists because the `execRoot_bg2(cmd)` function calls `os.system()` with user-controlled input in the `cmd` parameter. This function is intended for executing a command (provided as a string) in a subshell. Incorporating user-supplied data into a command string that is passed as an argument to the `os.system()` function creates an opportunity for a command injection vulnerability. The following is the decompiled Python source code of the affected function:

```
def execRoot_bg2(cmd):
   exec_path = os.path.join(sub('/lib.*$', '', os.path.realpath(__file__)), 'bin/executer_su')
   os.system(exec_path + ' ' + cmd + ' &')

```

The affected `execRoot_bg2()` function is invoked by the `CGICreateLVOnDisk()` and `CGICreateMdVol_VG()` functions within the `storage_cgi.py` controller. The following is the decompiled Python source code of the mentioned handler functions, showing the command strings created with the old-style string formatting operator `%`.

```
def CGICreateMdVol_VG(cherrypy, arguments):
    auth_status = authentication(arguments)
    if auth_status != AUTH_PASS:
        return gui_errmsg(auth_status)

        if arguments.has_key('raidName') and arguments.has_key('raidLevel') and
          arguments.has_key('volType') and arguments.has_key('diskxList'):
            if type(arguments['diskxList']) != list:

                    with open(storage_main.CREATE_VG_LCK) as (f):
                        info = f.read().strip()
                    if info == '':
                        sleep(0.5)

            return storage_main.GUI_ERRMSG_ARG
        return storage_main.GUI_ERRMSG_ARG

                arguments['diskxList'] = [
                 arguments['diskxList']]
            sec = 0
            while path.exists(storage_main.CREATE_VG_LCK) and sec <= 5:
                sleep(1)
                sec = sec + 1
            if sec > 5:
                storage_main.StoDebug('Error(can not enter critical): file=' + storage_main.CREATE_VG_LCK)
                return storage_main.GUI_ERRMSG_UNEXPECTED
            cmd = '%s -c \'from models import storage_main; storage_main.MainCreateLVOnDisk("%s", "%s", "%s", "%s", %s)\'' % (storage_main.PYTHON, arguments['volName'], arguments['volSiz'], arguments['raidName'], arguments['raidLevel'], json.dumps(arguments['diskxList']))
            storage_main.StoDebug(cmd)
            execRoot_bg2(cmd)
            sleep(0.5)
            for i in range(10):
                if path.exists(storage_main.CREATE_VG_LCK):
                    with open(storage_main.CREATE_VG_LCK) as (f):
                        info = f.read().strip()
                    if info == '':

                    sleep(0.5)
            storage_main.StoDebug('error, cgi time out')
            return storage_main.GUI_ERRMSG_ARG
        return storage_main.GUI_ERRMSG_ARG

```

The `CGICreateLVOnDisk()` and `CGICreateMdVol_VG()` functions turned out to be the API handlers of the `createDiskGroupVolume` and `createRaidOrDiskGroup` commands available through the web management interface after authentication. The following is the relevant excerpt of the `/usr/local/apache/htdocs/desktop,/utility/command.js` file that maps commands to their API endpoints.

```
var cmdPool = {
...SNIP...
createRaidOrDiskGroup:'/cmd,/ck6fup6/storage_cgi/CGICreateMdVol_VG',
createDiskGroupVolume:'/cmd,/ck6fup6/storage_cgi/CGICreateLVOnDisk',
...SNIP...
}

```

The `raidName`, `raidLevel`, `volType` and `diskxList` parameters at `/cmd,/ck6fup6/storage_cgi/CGICreateMdVol_VG` appear to be vulnerable to Python code injection or OS command injection attacks. Attackers could use the double quote ( `"` ) character to inject arbitrary Python statements or the single quote ( `'` ) character to break out of the original Python command and inject arbitrary OS commands.

The vulnerability in the `CGICreateMdVol_VG()` handler can be confirmed with an authenticated user via the following URLs:

```
http[:]//NAS326/cmd,/ck6fup6/storage_cgi/CGICreateMdVol_VG?whoami=admin&raidName=1%22%2C__import__(%22os%22).system(%22id%3E%2Ftmp%2Fbugproved%22)%2C%22&raidLevel=2&volType=3&diskxList=4
http[:]//NAS326/cmd,/ck6fup6/storage_cgi/CGICreateMdVol_VG?whoami=admin&raidName=1%22)%27%3Bid%3E%2Ftmp%2Fbugproved%3B%27(%22&raidLevel=2&volType=3&diskxList=4

```

We submitted the payloads `1",__import__("os").system("id>/tmp/bugproved"),"` and `1")';id>/tmp/bugproved;'("` in the `raidName` parameter. The application created the `/tmp/bugproved` file, containing the output from the injected command, indicating that the Python code was interpreted and the OS command was executed.

Conveniently, the command string passed to the `execRoot_bg2()` function is logged in the `/tmp/sto_log` file. *Figure 2.* shows the log content with the PoC payloads and the output of the executed commands.

Figure 2. Injecting code into the createRaidOrDiskGroup command](/uploads/Figure02_Main_Create_Md_Vol_VG_90d00c4fd6.png)

Furthermore, the `volName`, `volSize`, `raidName`, `raidLevel` and `diskxList` parameters at `/cmd,/ck6fup6/storage_cgi/CGICreateLVOnDisk` are also affected. We can observe the same results by submitting the same payloads in the `volName` parameter. *Figure 3.* shows the log content with the payloads and the output of the executed commands.

```

```
## CVE-2023-37928 - Python code injection vulnerability in `simZysh`

This issue seems to result from an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-27992, which appears to be a duplicate of CVE-2019-10633 originally reported by Max Dulin. We independently reported this vulnerability to Zyxel before we became aware of Maxâs research.

Similarly to the mentioned vulnerabilities, the specific flaw exists within the implementation of the MVC model in the `simZysh()` function of the `main_wsgi.py` component of the web management interface. Attackers can use specially crafted values in multiple path query parameters to execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the web server process running as `nobody`.

The `c%d` query parameters used at path `/cmd,/simZysh` appear to be vulnerable to Python code injection attacks. The purpose of this function is to simulate `zyshcgi`'s output. The function expects commands in the format `controller action {"arg1": value, "arg2": value, ...}`. We submitted the payload `system_main whoami {__import__("os").system("id>/tmp/bugproved")}` in the `c0` request parameter, as *Figure 4.* shows.

[![Figure 4. Python code injection vulnerability in the c0 parameter](/uploads/Figure04_sim_Zysh_1_00e0ecd571.png)

Figure 4. Python code injection vulnerability in the c0 parameter](/uploads/Figure04_sim_Zysh_1_00e0ecd571.png)

The application does not seem to return the command output in its responses. However, we can find the output of the injected `id` command in the file `bugproved` created in the `/tmp` directory, as *Figure 5.* shows.

[![Figure 5. Output of the injected id command](/uploads/Figure05_sim_Zysh_2_5cbbfa245c.png)

Figure 5. Output of the injected id command](/uploads/Figure05_sim_Zysh_2_5cbbfa245c.png)

The path `/cmd,` is just an alias to a WSGI application. Hence, requests made for `http://NAS326/cmd,` causes the web server to run the WSGI application defined in the `main.wsgi` file in the `/usr/local/apache/web_framework` directory. The following is the relevant excerpt of the `httpd_special.conf` file in the `/etc/service_conf` directory:

```
<Directory /usr/local/apache/web_framework>
  Order allow,deny
  Allow from all
</Directory>

WSGIScriptAlias /cmd, /usr/local/apache/web_framework/main.wsgi

...SNIP...

```

The web application redirects requests from `/ck6fup6` and `/tjp6jp6y4` to the WSGI server listening on the socket `/tmp/main_wsgi.sock` to `/ck6fup6_to_wsgi_server` and `/tjp6jp6y4_to_wsgi_server` following the `/<controller>/<action>` pattern. The below is the decompiled Python source code of the discussed request handler functions from the `main.wsgi` file:

```
def ck6fup6(self, *url_args, **request_args):
...SNIP...
       url = tools_cherrypy.SOCKET_URL_PREFIX + '/ck6fup6_to_wsgi_server/%s/%s' % (url_args[0], url_args[1])
       response = tools_cherrypy.socket_request(url, data=request_args, cookies=self.set_cookies())
       if response == tools_cherrypy.INT_SERV_ERROR:
           return tools_cherrypy.gui_errmsg(response)
       return response.json()

def tjp6jp6y4(self, *url_args, **request_args):
...SNIP...
       if url_args[0] == 'register_main' and url_args[1] == 'setCookie':
...SNIO...
       else:
           url = tools_cherrypy.SOCKET_URL_PREFIX + '/tjp6jp6y4_to_wsgi_server/%s/%s' % (url_args[0], url_args[1])
           response = tools_cherrypy.socket_request(url, data=request_args, cookies=self.set_cookies())
           if response == tools_cherrypy.INT_SERV_ERROR:
               return response
           return response.content
       return

```

In this case, requests are processed in the `simZysh()` handler function that will load the requested controller scripts and execute the specified functions via `eval()`. Be aware that the WSGI server runs in a separate process from the web server. Hence, the injected code will be executed in the context of the WSGI server process. The following is the relevant excerpt of the decompiled Python source code of the mentioned request handler function:

```
def simZysh(self, *url_args, **request_args):
    r_value = {}
    c_index = 0
    while True:
        c_key = 'c%d' % c_index
        if request_args.has_key(c_key):
            controller_n, action_n, args = request_args[c_key].split(' ', 2)
            try:
                controller = __import__('controllers.%s' % controller_n)
                tmp_result = eval('controller.%s.%s(cherrypy=%s, arguments=%s)' % (controller_n, action_n, 'cherrypy', args))
...SNIP...
            except:
...SNIP...
        else:
            break
        c_index += 1
    return r_value

```

Further analysis confirmed that the vulnerability lies again within the implementation of the MVC model. The web application uses the `eval()` function to load controllers and perform actions based on the `/<controller>/<action>` path segments. The evaluated Python expression is specified in the string pattern `controller.%s.%s(cherrypy=%s, arguments=%s)` and formatted based on user-supplied input.

Python code injection vulnerabilities arise when the application incorporates user-controllable data into a string dynamically evaluated by a code interpreter, in this case via the `eval()` function. If the user input is not strictly validated, attackers can use specially crafted input to modify the original code to be executed and inject arbitrary code that the server will run.

The vulnerability can be confirmed with an authenticated user via the following URL:

```
http[:]//NAS326/cmd,/simZysh?c0=system_main%20whoami%20{__import__(%22os%22).system(%22id%3E%2ftmp%2fbugproved%22)}

```
