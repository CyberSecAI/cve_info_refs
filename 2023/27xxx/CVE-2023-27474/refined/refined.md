Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of URL-encoded query parameters within the password reset functionality. Specifically, the `directus/api/src/utils/url.ts` file was constructing URLs by manually concatenating parameters without proper encoding, leading to the unescaping of encoded characters in the `reset_url` query parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper URL encoding: The application was not correctly encoding query parameters in the password reset URL, leading to unescaped characters.
- HTML Injection: The vulnerability allowed for HTML injection via the `reset_url` parameter when using a custom reset URL, which could be included in the password reset email.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- HTML Injection: An attacker could inject malicious HTML into the password reset email by crafting a URL with malicious HTML in the query parameters, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities.
- By manipulating the `reset_url` an attacker could potentially redirect users to malicious websites during the password reset process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. An attacker could trigger this vulnerability by sending a password reset request with a specially crafted `reset_url` containing encoded characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker doesn't need any privileges to exploit the vulnerability. They only need to initiate a password reset request with the crafted URL.
- No user interaction is required, meaning the attack can be carried out without any actions from the victim other than receiving the email and clicking the reset link.
