| Describe the Bug URL handling is not properly encoding query parameter components according to the spec, this leads to various bugs. Found it requesting reset password emails.  The affecting code is:   [directus/api/src/utils/url.ts](https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/abde5adacdfa8a377d941923059c97c72ef6e15a/api/src/utils/url.ts#L69-L73)  Lines 69 to 73 in [abde5ad](/directus/directus/commit/abde5adacdfa8a377d941923059c97c72ef6e15a)   |  | Object.keys(this.query).length !== 0 | | --- | --- | |  | ? `?${Object.entries(this.query) | |  | .map(([k, v]) => `${k}=${v}`) | |  | .join('&')}` | |  | : ''; |      We cannot be building URLs by hand without non RFC compliant character handling. To Reproduce  1. Request a password reset request with a `reset_url` containing encoded characters    With the REST api:     ```    curl --request POST \        --url "$BASE_URL/auth/password/request" \        --header 'content-type: application/json' \        --data '{              "email": "sample@example.com",              "reset_url": "https://example.com/sample-ath?sample_encoded_parameter=sample%2Bvalue%21"        }'    ```     Optionally in GraphQL:     ```    mutation auth_password_request {        auth_password_request(            email: "sample@example.com"            reset_url: "https://example.com/sample-ath?sample_encoded_parameter=sample%2Bvalue%21"        )    }    ```     As you can see the URL contains a parameter `sample_encoded_parameter` with the value `sample+value!` (when encoded corresponds to `sample%2Bvalue%21`) 2. An email will be sent with the following reset link:     ```    https://example.com/sample-ath?sample_encoded_parameter=sample+value!&token=JWT_TOKEN_REDACTED        ```     Instead we should be receiving     ```    https://example.com/sample-ath?sample_encoded_parameter=sample%2Bvalue%21&token=JWT_TOKEN_REDACTED        ```     Directus is *unescaping* the query parameters, and they should be kept as is (here demonstrated for values, but affects keys too).  Errors Shown *No response* What version of Directus are you using? 9.22.4 What version of Node.js are you using? 18.13.0 What database are you using? (not relevant) PostgreSQL 13 What browser are you using? (not relevant) Chrome How are you deploying Directus? locally and Docker *PaaS is not affected* |

# HTML Injection in Password Reset email to custom Reset URL

High

[br41nslug](/br41nslug)
published
GHSA-4hmq-ggrm-qfc6
Mar 6, 2023

## Package

npm

directus
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 9.22.4

## Patched versions

9.23.0

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

Instances relying on an allow-listed reset URL are vulnerable to an HTML injection attack through the use of query parameters in the reset URL.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

The problem has been resolved and released under version 9.23.0. People relying on a custom password reset URL should upgrade to 9.23.0 or later, or remove the custom reset url from the configured allow list.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Disable the custom reset URL allow list.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
