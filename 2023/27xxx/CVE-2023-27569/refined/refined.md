Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2023-27569 and CVE-2023-27570:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**

*   **CVE-2023-27569:** Improper sanitization of the `_ga` cookie within the `saveGanalyticsCookie()` and `gaParseCookie()` functions of the Tracking et Conversions (eo\_tags) module for PrestaShop.
*   **CVE-2023-27570:** Improper sanitization of User-Agent and Referer headers within the `trackReferrer()` function of the same module.

**Weaknesses:**

*   Insufficient input validation/sanitization of user-controlled data (cookies, User-Agent, Referer) before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the module failed to use `pSQL()` or similar sanitization on the data before inserting it into the database.
*   The vulnerability existed because data from the `_ga` cookie, User-Agent, and Referer were directly used in SQL queries, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CVE-2023-27569 & CVE-2023-27570:**
    *   Potential for complete database compromise.
    *   Obtaining admin access to the application.
    *   Technical and personal data leaks.
    *   Modification or deletion of data.
    *   Potential for complete server compromise, if database access is not properly restricted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CVE-2023-27569:** An attacker can forge an HTTP request with a compromised `_ga` cookie.
*   **CVE-2023-27570:** An attacker can forge an HTTP request with a compromised User-Agent or Referer header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **CVE-2023-27569:** No special privileges or user interaction are needed (anonymous access).
*  **CVE-2023-27570:** No special privileges are needed for versions of the module prior to 1.2.1. After version 1.2.1, it requires Privileges (PR) and user interaction (UI) to be exploited, but the severity is lower.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions 1.2.0 to 1.4.18 of the `eo_tags` module. Version 1.4.19 fixed the issue by sanitizing the data with `pSQL()`.
* The exploit is hard to detect, as requests appear as regular GET or POST in logs.
*  The `trackReferrer()` vulnerability, after version 1.2.1 was moved to `EoTagsStats.php` requiring user interaction to exploit
* The provided content includes code snippets showing the fix, specifically how `pSQL()` is used to sanitize the data.
*   The advisory also recommends general security practices, including upgrading PrestaShop, changing the database prefix, and using a WAF (Web Application Firewall).

**CVSS Score:**

*   The CVSS base score is 9.8, indicating a critical vulnerability.
