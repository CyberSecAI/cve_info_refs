- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `tshirtecommerce` module, specifically in the `/tshirtecommerce/fonts.php` endpoint via the `type` GET parameter and the `tshirtecommerce/ajax.php?type=svg` endpoint via the `file_name` POST parameter. This lack of validation allows for path traversal attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The module is vulnerable to multiple path traversal issues (CWE-22), allowing attackers to access files outside the intended directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's file system. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information like database credentials, private keys, or other confidential data stored in configuration or log files.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vectors are network-based, utilizing HTTP GET and POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints (`/tshirtecommerce/fonts.php` and `tshirtecommerce/ajax.php?type=svg`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs no special privileges or user interaction, only the ability to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
