**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: DO NOT REPORT VULNERABILITIES SOLELY TO THE AUTHOR OR MARKETPLACE.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities directly to us. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of the PrestaShop ecosystem. Unfortunately, many module developers may not always recognize or acknowledge the vulnerabilities in their code, whether due to lack of awareness, or inability to properly evaluate the associated risk, or other reasons.

Given the rise in professional cybercrime networks actively seeking out these vulnerabilities, it's crucial that any potential threats are promptly addressed and the community is informed. The most effective method to do this is by publishing a CVE, like the one provided below.

Should you discover any vulnerabilities, **please report them to us at: report[@]security-presta.org** or visit [https://security-presta.org](https://security-presta.org/) for more information.

Every vulnerability report helps make the community more secure, and we are profoundly grateful for any information shared with us.

# [CVE-2023-27639][CVE-2023-27640][CWE-22] Multiple path traversal in Custom Product Designer (tshirtecommerce) module for PrestaShop

Mar 30, 2023

In the Custom Product Designer (tshirtecommerce) module for PrestaShop, HTTP requests can be forged using POST and GET parameters enabling a remote attacker to perform directory traversal on the system and view the contents of code files. Since the module appears not to have been maintained since 2019, it is strongly recommended to remove it.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-27639](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-27639) / [CVE-2023-27640](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-27640)
* **Published at**: 2023-03-30
* **Advisory source**: Friends-Of-Presta
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: tshirtecommerce
* **Impacted release**: <= 2.1.4 (latest version)
* **Product author**: Tshirtecommerce Team
* **Weakness**: [CWE-22](https://www.cvedetails.com/cwe-details/22/cwe.html)
* **Severity**: high (7.5)

## Description

The following issues have been seen in the latest version of the PrestaShop Custom Product Designer (tshirtecommerce) module for PrestaShop, released on July 24, 2019 (These issues remain unresolved in the most recent version of the module) :

* an HTTP request can be manipulated using the GET parameter `type` in the `/tshirtecommerce/fonts.php` endpoint, enabling a remote attacker to perform directory traversal on the system and open files without restrictions on the extension and path. The content of the file will be returned in base64-encoded format.
* an HTTP request can be manipulated using the POST parameter `file_name` in the `tshirtecommerce/ajax.php?type=svg` endpoint, enabling a remote attacker to perform directory traversal on the system and open files without restrictions on the extension and path. Note that only files that can be parsed in XML format can be opened.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: none
* **Availability**: none

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain database access
* Extract sensitive data, such as tokens or private keys stored in config files
* Extract other private data, such as log files or exports

## Proof of concept

Examples:

1. For all types of files, will return a base64 response of the content of the file (critical):
   ```
   https://example.test/tshirtecommerce/fonts.php?name=2&type=./../index.php

   ```
2. When a file can be parsed as XML without error (less common):
   ```
   curl --request POST 'https://example.test/tshirtecommerce/ajax.php?type=svg' \
   --data-urlencode 'url=./../vendor/jdorn/sql-formatter/examples' \
   --data-urlencode 'file_name=examples.php'

   ```
