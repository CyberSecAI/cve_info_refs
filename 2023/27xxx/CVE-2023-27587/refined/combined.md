## Affected versions

< commit 8533b01

## Patched versions

commit 8533b01

## Description

### Impact

If an error occurs when adding an article, the website shows the user an error message. If the error originates from the Google Cloud TTS request, then it will include the *full* URL of the request. The request URL contains the Google Cloud API key. See below for what this error message looks like, with redaction.

### Patches

This has been patched in [`8533b01`](https://github.com/rozbb/readtomyshoe/commit/8533b01c818939a0fa919c7244d8dbf5daf032af). Upgrade as soon as possible.

In addition, delete the current GCP API key and issue a new one.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
