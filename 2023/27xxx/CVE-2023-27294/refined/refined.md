**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript as the description for a calendar event.
- When other users browse to that event, the injected JavaScript will execute in their browsers.
- This can lead to:
    - Stealing session tokens from users with higher permission levels.
    - Forcing users to perform actions without their knowledge.

**Attack vectors:**
- An authenticated attacker with access to a restricted account can submit the malicious payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid, but potentially restricted, account on the OpenCATS system.
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify calendar events.
- The attacker does not need to be an administrator or have high-level privileges, a restricted account will work.
