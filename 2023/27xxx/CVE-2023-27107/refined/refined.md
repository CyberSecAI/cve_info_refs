The provided content is related to CVE-2023-27107.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `runReport` function of MyQ Print Server, which lacks proper access control. This allows unauthorized users to generate reports that should only be accessible to administrators.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The `runReport` function does not properly restrict access based on user roles, allowing non-admin users to invoke it with arbitrary report IDs.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The exported reports contain sensitive information, including unsalted MD5 hashes of user PINs and passwords, user audit logs, and printer information.
- **Unsalted Password Hashing:** The use of unsalted MD5 for password and PIN hashing makes them vulnerable to offline brute-force attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** Attackers can obtain user PIN and password hashes, which can be easily cracked due to the use of unsalted MD5, leading to account takeover.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information including user details, audit logs, and printer configurations.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although not a direct escalation of privilege, by taking over user accounts, including administrative ones, an attacker may escalate privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct URL Access:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable `runReport` function via crafted URLs, bypassing the web interface's access controls. The URL format is `https://HOST:PORT/en-us/#{"r":"runReport","id":<report_id>,"format":"csv"}`.
- **Web Interface Exploitation:** Though the primary vector is direct URL access, the user report functionality is available in the web interface for admin accounts. However, this specific access vector is not needed for exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the MyQ Print Server.
- **No Authentication Needed to Export Reports:**  An attacker does not need to be logged in to exploit the vulnerability. A valid account on the system may be required to access the interface, however, the reports can be accessed using the URL without authentication, even by non-admin users
- **Basic Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs to know the URL pattern to invoke the `runReport` function and the report IDs to extract specific information.
