A vulnerability has been identified in RUGGEDCOM CROSSBOW (All versions < V5.2). The client query handler of the affected application fails to check for proper permissions when assigning groups to user accounts. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to assign administrative groups to otherwise non-privileged user accounts.
