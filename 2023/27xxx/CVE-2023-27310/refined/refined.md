- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The client query handler of the affected application fails to check for proper permissions when assigning groups to user accounts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing Authorization (CWE-862). The application does not properly validate permissions before allowing a user to assign groups to other user accounts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated remote attacker can escalate privileges by assigning administrative groups to non-privileged user accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, and have high privileges.
