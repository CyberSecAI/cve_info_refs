- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `formModifyDnsForward` function in the `/bin/httpd` file of Tenda V15EV1.0 firmware does not validate the length of the `DnsName`, `Wan`, `RuleEN`, and `ip_addr` parameters received through a POST request. This lack of validation leads to a buffer overflow when the `sprintf()` function is used to process these parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability in the `formModifyDnsForward` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the `httpd` service. Moreover, by overwriting the return address, an attacker can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/modifyDNSForward` endpoint. The attacker needs to include overly long strings in the `DNSDomainName` and `DNSForwardEn` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the device and the ability to send HTTP POST requests.
