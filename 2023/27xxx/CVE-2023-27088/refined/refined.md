Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** A vertical authorization vulnerability exists in `IndexController.java` of the `feiqu-opensource` project. This means that a user with low permissions can perform actions that should be restricted to a user with higher permissions.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core issue is a lack of proper access control checks within the `IndexController.java`, allowing users with lower privileges to bypass intended restrictions. This leads to a vertical privilege escalation vulnerability.

* **Impact of Exploitation:** A low-privileged demo user can perform actions within the scope of an admin user. Specifically, this vulnerability enables the modification of the blacklist IP addresses in the system. This could have several significant consequences such as unauthorized blocking or unblocking of IP addresses or even Denial of Service (DoS) by blocking valid traffic.

* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the exposed functionality in `IndexController.java` which does not properly enforce user roles or permissions.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a user with low permissions within the system. There is no indication of the need for specialized technical skills or access; they simply need to have an account with insufficient privileges for the actions they intend to take.
