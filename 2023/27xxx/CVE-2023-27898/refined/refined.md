The provided content is related to CVE-2023-27898.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Jenkins version a plugin depends on is not escaped when rendering the error message stating its incompatibility with the current version of Jenkins in the plugin manager.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of proper output sanitization of the Jenkins version information displayed in error messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker must be able to provide plugins to the configured update sites and have this error message shown by Jenkins instances.
- The manipulated plugin does not need to be installed, only present in the update site metadata.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the plugin metadata provided by the update site, either through a malicious custom update site, or by manipulating an existing one.
- The attacker does not need to have any special privileges within the Jenkins instance itself.
- The user must view the vulnerable error message in the plugin manager.
