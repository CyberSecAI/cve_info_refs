Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-27903:

**Root Cause:**
- When a build is triggered via the Jenkins CLI and a file parameter is provided via standard input, Jenkins creates a temporary file on the controller.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- The temporary file created by Jenkins when handling file parameters from the CLI is created with insecure default permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller's file system could potentially read and/or write to the temporary file before it's used in the build process. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- The impact is rated as low, with potential for low confidentiality and integrity impact, and no availability impact (C:L/I:L/A:N).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires the attacker to have access to the Jenkins controller's file system and the ability to trigger a build via the CLI with a crafted file parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have low-level access (e.g., through a compromised user account) to the Jenkins controller's file system.
- The attacker must also be able to trigger builds using the Jenkins CLI.
- The vulnerability is more easily exploitable on systems that use a shared temporary directory, like most Linux environments.
- The default file permissions on the system will need to be overly permissive (allowing read/write access) for the exploitation to be successful
