Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-27383:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a protection mechanism failure within specific versions of Intel® oneAPI HPC Toolkit and Intel® MPI Library software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Protection Mechanism Failure:** The core issue is a flaw in how the software protects itself or its resources, allowing a privileged user to bypass intended restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows a privileged user to gain even higher privileges than initially granted. This could lead to unauthorized access, control over the system, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Adjacent Access:** An attacker needs to have adjacent access to the targeted system. The specific nature of “adjacent access” is not further specified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged User:** The attacker must already be a privileged user on the system.
- **Adjacent Access:** The attacker must be able to interact with the system via adjacent access.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- Intel® oneAPI HPC Toolkit before version 2023.1
- Intel® MPI Library software before version 2021.9

**Mitigation:**
- Intel recommends updating:
  - Intel® oneAPI HPC Toolkit to version 2023.1 or later.
  - Intel® MPI Library to version 2021.9 or later.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found internally by Intel employees.
*   The document also includes information on other vulnerabilities in Intel oneAPI products (e.g. CVE-2023-24592), which are not related to CVE-2023-27383.
