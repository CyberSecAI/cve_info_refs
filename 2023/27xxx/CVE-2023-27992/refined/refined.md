- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a pre-authentication command injection flaw in the Zyxel NAS devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Pre-authentication command injection, allowing execution of operating system (OS) commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands remotely on the vulnerable NAS device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, requiring network access to the device. No authentication is needed.
