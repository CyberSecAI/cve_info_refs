Schneider Electric Security Notification

IGSS (Interactive Graphical SCADA System)

14 March 2023

Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of multiple vulnerabilities in its Data Server, Dashboard and Custom
Reports modules for the IGSS (Interactive Graphical SCADA System) product.

The IGSS product is a state-of-the art SCADA system used for monitoring and controlling
industrial processes. The Data Server is a module with a TCP interface used by other modules
like the Dashboard and the Custom Reports to access data of the SCADA System to be
presented.

Failure to apply the remediation provided below may result in Denial of Service and dashboards
or report files in the IGSS Report folder being lost, added or changed. Further it may risk remote
code execution, which could result in a variety of issues including loss of control of the SCADA
System with IGSS running in production mode.

Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2023-27980

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 8.8 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

A CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability exists in the Data Server
TCP interface that could allow the creation of a malicious report file in the IGSS project report
directory, this could lead to remote code execution when a victim eventually opens the report.

CVE ID: CVE-2023-27982

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 8.8 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

A CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity vulnerability exists in the Data Server
that could cause manipulation of dashboard files in the IGSS project report directory, when an
attacker sends specific crafted messages to the Data Server TCP port, this could lead to remote
code execution when a victim eventually opens a malicious dashboard file.

CVE ID: CVE-2023-27978

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 7.8 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

A CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability exists in the Dashboard module that
could cause an interpretation of malicious payload data, potentially leading to remote code
execution when an attacker gets the user to open a malicious file.

CVE ID: CVE-2023-27981

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 7.8 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

A CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory vulnerability exists in
Custom Reports that could cause a remote code execution when a victim tries to open a
malicious report.

CVE ID: CVE-2023-27984

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 7.8 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

A CWE-20: Improper Input Validation vulnerability exists in Custom Reports that could cause a
macro to be executed, potentially leading to remote code execution when a user opens a
malicious report file planted by an attacker.

CVE ID: CVE-2023-27977

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 6.5 | Medium | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L

A CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity vulnerability exists in the Data
Server that could cause access to delete files in the IGSS project report directory, this could
lead to loss of data when an attacker sends specific crafted messages to the Data Server TCP
port.

CVE ID: CVE-2023-27979

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 6.5 | Medium | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L

A CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity vulnerability exists in the Data Server
that could allow the renaming of files in the IGSS project report directory, this could lead to
denial of service when an attacker sends specific crafted messages to the Data Server TCP
port.

CVE ID: CVE-2023-27983

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 6.5 | Medium | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L

A CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability exists in the Data Server
TCP interface that could allow deletion of reports from the IGSS project report directory, this
would lead to loss of data when an attacker abuses this functionality.

Remediation

Affected Product & Version   Remediation

IGSS Data Server
IGSS Dashboard
IGSS Custom Reports
V16.0.0.23040 and prior

Version 16.0.0.23041 of IGSS Data Server, Dashboard and
Custom Reports (RMS) includes corrections and mitigations for
these vulnerabilities and is available for download through IGSS
Master > Update IGSS Software or here:

https://igss.schneider-
electric.com/igss/igssupdates/v160/IGSSUPDATE.ZIP

Customers should use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to
their systems. We strongly recommend the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these
patches in a Test and Development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact
Schneider Electric’s Customer Care Center if you need assistance removing a patch.

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately
apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Read the Security Guideline for IGSS on securing an IGSS SCADA-installation.
•  Make sure to take backup of files in the report directory. In the System Configuration
module under Files, automatic backup can be enabled for the file types to backup.

•  Strip report output from Excel output. In the System Configuration module under

Reports, stripping of macros for the output engine can be enabled, reducing the risk of
distributing an unsafe report.

•  Follow the general security recommendation below and verify that devices are isolated
on a private network and that firewalls are configured with strict boundaries for devices
that require remote access.

Note: Since the IGSS Custom Reports rely on Excel, customers should avoid using report
formats in the xlsm format that can potentially contain malicious macros. Before opening an
xlsm report format file from IGSS Master, users will now have to confirm that input is trusted,
like what Excel does when an Excel workbook with macros is opened.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.

•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
