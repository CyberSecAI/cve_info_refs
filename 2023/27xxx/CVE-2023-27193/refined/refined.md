Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-27193

**Vulnerable Product:** Easy Clean (com.ludashi.xsuperclean)

**Affected Version:** 1.1.3

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application loads data from SharedPreference files into memory and uses this data in critical functions. This makes it vulnerable to manipulation by a malicious app that can modify these SharedPreference files, thus altering the behavior of the Easy Clean app.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Data Storage:** The application relies on SharedPreference files for important data and doesn't protect against unauthorized modification.
- **Lack of Data Validation:** The app does not validate or sanitize the data it loads from SharedPreference files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can gain elevated privileges by modifying the `key_ad_new_user_avoid_time` field in the SharedPreference files.
- **Application Misbehavior:** Altering SharedPreference data leads to unexpected and potentially malicious behavior of the application, such as ad blocking.
- **Persistent Malicious Configuration:** The injected, malicious data persists even after device reboots, making the issue difficult for users to resolve.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the device.
- **Malicious Application:** The attacker uses a malicious app that can modify the SharedPreference files of the target application (Easy Clean).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to install and run a malicious application on the same device as the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable application's SharedPreference file structure and the specific keys that can be exploited.

**Technical Details:**
The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrates the attack:
```java
public void attack(){
    ContentResolver contentResolver = this.getApplicationContext().getContentResolver();
    Uri uri = Uri.parse("content://com.ludashi.xsuperclean.util.pref.SharedPrefProvider");
    ContentValues contentValues = new ContentValues();
    contentValues.put("file_name","__default__");
    contentValues.put("type",4);
    contentValues.put("key","key_ad_new_user_avoid_time");
    contentValues.put("value","100000");
    contentResolver.update(uri,contentValues,null,null);
}
```
This code uses the `ContentResolver` to access and modify the SharedPreference file via its content provider. It specifically targets the `key_ad_new_user_avoid_time` field and sets its value to "100000".

This detailed description provides more context than the initial CVE description which only mentions a local attacker gaining privileges through the `key_ad_new_user_avoid_time` field.
