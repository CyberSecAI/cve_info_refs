- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cynet Client Agent v4.6.0.8010 allows attackers with Administrator rights to disable the EDR functions. This is achieved by disabling process privilege tokens.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of process privilege tokens, which allows an attacker to disable the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) functions of the Cynet Client Agent.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disable the EDR functions of the Cynet Client Agent. This could allow for other malicious actions to be taken without detection.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local. An attacker would need to have local access to the system running the vulnerable software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have Administrator rights on the system where the Cynet Client Agent is running.
