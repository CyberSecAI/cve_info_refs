## Changelog

### Bug fixes and improvements

#### Server

* Remote relationships now cannot be configured when the target data source does not support them. Previously these were allowed to be added but would fail at query time.
* Data Connector data sources can now be used as the source and/or target of remote relationships. Please note that only data connector agents that support foreach queries can be used as a target in a remote relationship.
* Fix `graphql-default` naming convention bugs ([#9426](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/9426), [#9430](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/9430))

#### Console

* Fix headers getting removed from event triggers configuration while updating trigger options
* Fix subscriptions in CLI console API explorer when connected to a Hasura instance that only supports `https/wss` (fix [#9475](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/9475))
* Show year in the date column while displaying event triggers, cron triggers and scheduled events
* Respect the GraphQL API naming convention while tracking a suggested relationship.
* Fix a bug that would cause the DB tree view to not show up if a Data Connector backed database is the only connected database.
* Allow removing event trigger auto clean-up configuration *(Enterprise edition only)*

#### Data Connectors

* The SQLite data connector agent now supports being a target of a remote relationship

# Unauthenticated path traversal vulnerability in Hasura GraphQL Engine

Critical

[timothy-hasura](/timothy-hasura)
published
GHSA-c9rw-rw2f-mj4x
Mar 13, 2023

## Package

graphql-engine
(Haskell)

## Affected versions

Up to 2.20.0

## Patched versions

v2.11.5, v2.20.1, v2.21.0-beta.1, v1.3.4

## Description

Security Notification

A Path Traversal security vulnerability has been recently discovered within the GraphQL Engine.

What we have done

We have patched versions 1.3, 2.11, 2.20, and 2.21-beta.

* v2.11.5
* v2.20.1
* v2.21.0-beta.1
* v1.3.4

What action do I need to take?

Hasura Cloud Projects: Projects running on Hasura Cloud were not vulnerable. No further action is needed unless you also self-host Hasura (see below).

Self-hosted Hasura Projects (Community Edition or Enterprise Edition): If your deployment is publicly exposed and not protected by a WAF or other HTTP protection layer, you may unset HASURA\_GRAPHQL\_CONSOLE\_ASSETS\_DIR, disable console for versions prior to 2.17.0, or update immediately to one of the fixed versions.

Details

Hasura Console is vulnerable to a Critical Path Enumeration vulnerability when configured to use Custom Assets. If your deployment sets HASURA\_GRAPHQL\_CONSOLE\_ASSETS\_DIR, then you may be vulnerable, as this leverages Haskell file capabilities which are vulnerable to enumeration. In order to be vulnerable, the following must be true:

1. You must set HASURA\_GRAPHQL\_CONSOLE\_ASSETS\_DIR
2. You have not disabled the console or are using version 2.17.0 or later
3. Your system, is exposed to untrusted systems or users
4. Your system does not have protections provided by a WAF, IPS, or webserver configuration that would block path traversal

It has been determined that this attack can be leveraged to recover the admin secret for the console and API.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do reach out to us at support@hasura.io.

Thank you,

The Hasura Cloud Team
