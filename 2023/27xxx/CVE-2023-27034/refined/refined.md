- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Jms Blog module for PrestaShop contains a Blind SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input in several front controllers. Specifically, the `$_month`, `$email`, and `$tag` variables are directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Blind SQL Injection (CWE-89): The module is vulnerable to SQL injection because it constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-supplied input without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Technical and personal data leaks
    - Obtaining admin access
    - Removal of all data of the linked PrestaShop installation
    - Display of sensitive tables to the front office, potentially unlocking admin's ajax scripts of modules protected by tokens.
    - Actively used to deploy webskimmers to steal credit cards.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
    - HTTP requests: The vulnerable SQL calls can be executed with simple HTTP requests to the front controllers in the `/controllers/front/` directory. The specific files are `archive.php`, `post.php`, and `tag.php`.
    - Attackers can conceal the module controllerâ€™s path during the exploit. Conventional frontend logs will only show "POST /".

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - No privileges are required; the attack can be performed by unauthenticated users.
    - No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.
