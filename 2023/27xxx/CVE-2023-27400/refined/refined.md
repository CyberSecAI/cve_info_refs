- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application contains an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer while parsing a specially crafted SPP file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs when a user opens a malicious SPP file using the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious SPP file and trick a user into opening it with the vulnerable application. This could be achieved via social engineering.
