    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2023-27788",
      "root_cause": "A reachable assertion in the `ports2PORT()` function within `portmap.c` occurs when an empty portmap string is passed to `tcprewrite` using the `--portmap` option.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `ports2PORT` function does not handle the case where an empty string is passed as a portmap argument, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
        "The program lacks proper input validation for the portmap string."
      ],
      "impact": "The program terminates abruptly due to an assertion failure, resulting in a denial-of-service.",
       "attack_vector": "An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by providing an empty string as the argument to the `--portmap` option when running `tcprewrite`.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute the `tcprewrite` command with crafted arguments."
