  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2023-27482",
    "description": "An authentication bypass vulnerability was discovered in the Home Assistant Supervisor Integration, allowing an unauthenticated user to access any Supervisor API, potentially leading to account takeover, information disclosure, and remote code execution.",
    "affected_versions": {
      "home_assistant_core": "<2023.3.2",
      "home_assistant_supervisor": "<2023.03.3"
    },
    "patched_versions": {
      "home_assistant_core": "2023.3.2",
      "home_assistant_supervisor": "2023.03.3"
    },
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flawed authentication bypass mechanism in the Home Assistant Supervisor Integration. The `NO_AUTH` regular expression, intended to allow unauthenticated access to static media, was vulnerable to path traversal attacks using techniques such as double URL encoding (`app/.%252e/supervisor/info`) or by injecting tab characters (`app/.%09./supervisor/info`) that bypass the security filters in `http` integration.  Additionally, the `/api/hassio_ingress` endpoint was also vulnerable because it copies user-provided headers to the Supervisor API request, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication by including either `X-Hass-User-ID` or `X-Hass-Is-Admin` headers.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Authentication Bypass",
       "Path Traversal",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can access the Supervisor API, allowing for:\n\t* Account takeover.\n\t* Information disclosure (including sensitive data from backups, such as authentication keys, secrets.yaml file, and database information).\n\t* Remote code execution on the host system by installing and configuring the SSH & Web Terminal Add-on.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without requiring any user interaction. The attacker only needs to send specially crafted HTTP requests to a vulnerable Home Assistant instance.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was initially mitigated by applying security filters to block path traversal attempts, but these filters were bypassed by double URL encoding and by injecting tab characters in the URL. The `/api/hassio_ingress` endpoint also had a weakness due to copying user-provided headers to the Supervisor API requests, allowing unauthenticated requests when combined with a path traversal payload.",
