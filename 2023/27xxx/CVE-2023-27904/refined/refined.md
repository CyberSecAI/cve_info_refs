- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Jenkins prints error stack traces on agent-related pages when agent connections are broken.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure through error stack traces. The stack trace may contain information about Jenkins configuration that is otherwise inaccessible to attackers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain information about the Jenkins configuration.
- **Attack vectors**: Accessing agent-related pages when agent connections are broken.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to have low-level access to the Jenkins instance with the ability to access agent-related pages and cause agent connection to break.
