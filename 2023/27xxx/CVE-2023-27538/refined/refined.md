```
{
  "CVE-2023-27538": {
    "Root cause": "libcurl reuses a previously created SSH connection even when SSH options, specifically `CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE` and `CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE`, were changed, which should have prevented reuse.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass due to improper connection reuse.",
      "Incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2022-27782)"
    ],
    "Impact": "The reuse of an inappropriate connection may lead to unauthorized access or the transfer being done with the wrong credentials.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could potentially manipulate SSH options between transfers, leading to the reuse of a connection with different, possibly unauthorized, credentials.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the SSH options used by libcurl between connection attempts."
  }
