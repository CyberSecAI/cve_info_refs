## CVE-2023-27536

# GSS delegation too eager connection re-use

Project curl Security Advisory, March 20th 2023 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-27536.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when the GSS
delegation (`[CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION.html)`) option had been
changed that could have changed the user's permissions in a second
transfer.

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for
subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However,
this GSS delegation setting was left out from the configuration match
checks, making them match too easily, affecting
krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers.

## INFO

CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.22.0](vuln-7.22.0.html) to and including [7.88.1](vuln-7.88.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.22.0](vuln-7.22.0.html) and curl >= [8.0.0](vuln-8.0.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ebf42c4be76df4>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/cb49e67303dba>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [8.0.0](vuln-8.0.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use the `[CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION.html)` option

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on March 7, 2023. We
contacted distros@openwall on March 13, 2023.

curl [8.0.0](vuln-8.0.0.html) was released on March 20 2023, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

Package        : curl
Version        : 7.64.0-4+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-27533 CVE-2023-27535 CVE-2023-27536 CVE-2023-27538

Several security vulnerabilities have been found in cURL, an easy-to-use
client-side URL transfer library.

CVE-2023-27533

    A vulnerability in input validation exists in curl during
    communication using the TELNET protocol may allow an attacker to pass on
    maliciously crafted user name and "telnet options" during server
    negotiation. The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send
    content or perform option negotiation without the application's intent.
    This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user input,
    thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.

CVE-2023-27535

    An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in the FTP
    connection reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being used
    during subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are kept in a
    connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain
    FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER,
    CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in the
    configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This could
    lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer,
    potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

CVE-2023-27536

    An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in the
    connection reuse feature which can reuse previously established connections
    with incorrect user permissions due to a failure to check for changes in
    the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option. This vulnerability affects
    krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers and could potentially result in
    unauthorized access to sensitive information. The safest option is to not
    reuse connections if the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option has been changed.

CVE-2023-27538

    An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl where it
    reuses a previously established SSH connection despite the fact that an SSH
    option was modified, which should have prevented reuse. libcurl maintains a
    pool of previously used connections to reuse them for subsequent transfers
    if the configurations match. However, two SSH settings were omitted from
    the configuration check, allowing them to match easily, potentially leading
    to the reuse of an inappropriate connection.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
7.64.0-4+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

For the detailed security status of curl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl>

## CVE-2023-27535

# FTP too eager connection reuse

Project curl Security Advisory, March 20th 2023 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-27535.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl would reuse a previously created FTP connection even when one
or more options had been changed that could have made the effective user
a very different one, thus leading to doing the second transfer with the
wrong credentials.

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for
subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However,
several FTP settings were left out from the configuration match checks,
making them match too easily. The settings in questions are
`[CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT.html)`,
`[CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER.html)`,
`[CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC.html)` and `[CURLOPT_USE_SSL](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_USE_SSL.html)`
level.

## INFO

## CVE-2023-27537

# HSTS double free

Project curl Security Advisory, March 20th 2023 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-27537.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl supports sharing HSTS data between separate "handles". This
sharing was introduced without considerations for doing this sharing
across separate threads but there was no indication of this fact in the
documentation.

Due to missing mutexes or thread locks, two threads sharing the same
HSTS data could end up doing a double free or use after free.

## INFO

This feature was not implemented to support sharing between threads.
That is still left for future improvements. The fix for this issue is
therefore a documentation update clarifying that sharing HSTS between
threads is not expected to work.

CWE-415: Double Free

Severity: Low

Severity is set to Low because

* Not widely used functionality
* The timing necessary to trigger this has to match fairly exact
* Exploiting this for anything but denial of service is difficult

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.88.0](vuln-7.88.0.html) to and including [7.88.1](vuln-7.88.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.88.0](vuln-7.88.0.html) and curl >= [8.0.0](vuln-8.0.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/076a2f629119222a>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/dca4cdf071be0>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Do not share HSTS data between threads

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on March 8 2023. We
contacted distros@openwall on March 13, 2023.

curl [8.0.0](vuln-8.0.0.html) was released on March 20 2023, coordinated with the

## CVE-2023-27538

# SSH connection too eager reuse still

Project curl Security Advisory, March 20th 2023 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-27538.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when an SSH
related option had been changed that should have prohibited reuse.

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for
subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However,
two SSH settings were left out from the configuration match checks,
making them match too easily.

## INFO

These are the options that were not considered in the check, so curl
would reuse a connection even if the subsequent transfer would have
changed one or more of these options.

* `[CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE.html)`
* `[CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE.html)`

This flaw was initially introduced in curl [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html).

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2023-27538 to this issue.

This vulnerability is partially identical to [CVE-2022-27782](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27782.html) since
the fix for that previous issue was bad and did not actually correct the
problem for these SSH options.

CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness

The previous flaw, CVE-2022-27782, was set to a severity of Medium,
but since this is a partial of that and affects only two options that
rarely changes with the expectation that the user is different, this
time we set it to a severity of Low.

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html) to and including [7.88.1](vuln-7.88.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html) and curl >= [8.0.0](vuln-8.0.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2147284cad>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/af369db4d3833272b8ed>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [8.0.0](vuln-8.0.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Avoid SCP and SFTP transfers

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on March 9 2023. We
contacted distros@openwall on March 13, 2023.

curl [8.0.0](vuln-8.0.0.html) was released on March 20 2023, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-27782

# TLS and SSH connection too eager reuse

Project curl Security Advisory, May 11 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27782.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when a TLS
or SSH related option had been changed that should have prohibited
reuse.

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for
subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However,
several TLS and SSH settings were left out from the configuration match
checks, making them match too easily.

## INFO

Here are the list of options that were not considered in the check,
so curl would reuse a connection even if the subsequent transfer would
have changed one or more of these options.

### TLS options

* `[CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS.html)` (since [7.25.0](vuln-7.25.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_CRLFILE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_CRLFILE.html)` (since [7.19.0](vuln-7.19.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME.html)` (since [7.21.4](vuln-7.21.4.html))
* `[CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD.html)` (since [7.21.4](vuln-7.21.4.html))
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_OPTIONS](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_OPTIONS.html)` (since [7.52.0](vuln-7.52.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY_CRLFILE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY_CRLFILE.html)` (since [7.52.0](vuln-7.52.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY_TLSAUTH_USERNAME](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY_TLSAUTH_USERNAME.html)` (since [7.52.0](vuln-7.52.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD.html)` (since [7.52.0](vuln-7.52.0.html))

### SSH options

* `[CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE.html)` (since [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html))
* `[CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE.html)` (since [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html))

This flaw was initially introduced in curl [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html) and has been
widened several times since then. See table above for details

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-27782 to this issue.

CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html) to and including [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html) and curl >= [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2147284cad>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

The two patches for CVE-2022-27782: [TLS-fix](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/f18af4f874) and [SSH-fix](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/1645e9b44505abd5cbaf65da5282c3f33b5924a5)

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/1645e9b44505abd5cbaf65d>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on May 1, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 5.

libcurl [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html) was released on May 11 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
