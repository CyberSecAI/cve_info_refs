- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected application contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability while parsing specially crafted SPP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit this by tricking a user into opening a malicious SPP file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious SPP file to a user of the affected software. User interaction is required to open the malicious file.
