{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly validate the uploaded file type and allows a malicious file to be uploaded.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient file type validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, which can lead to session hijacking, defacement, and other malicious activities. The attacker can access the file without authentication.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with admin credentials can upload a file containing a malicious XSS payload via the file management interface. By modifying the Content-Type of the upload request to 'application/x-php', it bypasses the server's validation.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires administrator credentials to access the file upload functionality. The attacker also needs to be able to intercept and modify the upload request to change the content-type."
