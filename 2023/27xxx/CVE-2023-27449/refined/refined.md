Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a "Broken Access Control" issue within the Total Poll Lite plugin. This indicates that the plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in certain functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** Specifically, the vulnerability stems from missing authorization checks, authentication checks, or nonce token validation in the plugin's code. This lack of proper validation allows users with insufficient privileges to perform actions they should not be able to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (specifically a "Subscriber") can execute higher privileged actions. The specific actions aren't detailed, but the impact is that a user with limited access can perform actions that should be restricted to higher-level users or administrators.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's functions that lack proper access control mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account with "Subscriber" privileges on the WordPress site running the vulnerable plugin.
