**Affected Versions:** 9.88.1.0 and earlier

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is located in the "Profile setting function" of the plugin which allows for execution of arbitrary scripts within the browser of users.

**Weaknesses:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs in the profile settings, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of a user accessing the site, potentially leading to:

*   Redirection to malicious sites
*   Defacement of the website

**Attack Vector:**

*   The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the ability to modify profile settings.
*   The attacker injects malicious script into the profile settings.
*   When another user views a page containing the affected settings, the malicious script will be executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with the privilege to modify profile settings within the WordPress admin panel.
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject javascript into user-controlled input fields in the profile settings.
*   The attacker must be able to convince other users to view a page that displays the attacker's manipulated settings, triggering the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as a stored/persistent XSS because the malicious script is stored in the database and executed when a user accesses the affected page.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 and a CVSS v2 base score of 4.0.

**Solution:**

*   Update the VK All in One Expansion Unit plugin to version 9.88.2.0 or later.
