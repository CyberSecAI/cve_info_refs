  "description": "The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the 'WaterBilling-System v1.0' application. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `/billing/addclient1.php` file. The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the 'lname' and 'fname' input fields, which is then stored in the application and executed when the page is viewed. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. The provided example demonstrates how to inject the payload `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` to steal cookies.",
  "additional_information": "The attacker injects the XSS payload into the `lname` and `fname` parameters of the POST request to `/billing/addclient1.php`."
