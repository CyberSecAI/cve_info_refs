**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability. The application directly uses the user-supplied "id" parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify data in the database.
    - Potentially gain control of the database server and the entire application.
    - In this specific case, the attacker can query the current database as shown in the example, revealing its name.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is via a GET request to the `/Moosikay/admin/delete_user.php` endpoint, where the "id" parameter is manipulated to inject SQL code.
    
**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application, no authentication is mentioned as being required. They can craft the malicious SQL queries in the "id" parameter of the GET request.

**Additional details:**
The provided content includes sqlmap scan results, demonstrating the vulnerability's exploitability and providing information about the impact.
