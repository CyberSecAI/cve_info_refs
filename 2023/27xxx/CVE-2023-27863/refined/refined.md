- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stored SMB credentials may be exposed when transport encryption is enabled in IBM Spectrum Protect Plus for Db2 and Oracle during oracle backups, potentially allowing access to vSnap data stores.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of stored SMB credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to vSnap data stores.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs when transport encryption is enabled in IBM Spectrum Protect Plus for Db2 and Oracle during oracle backups.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have access to the exposed SMB credentials.
