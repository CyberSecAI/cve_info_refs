## CVE-2023-27537

# HSTS double free

Project curl Security Advisory, March 20th 2023 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-27537.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl supports sharing HSTS data between separate "handles". This
sharing was introduced without considerations for doing this sharing
across separate threads but there was no indication of this fact in the
documentation.

Due to missing mutexes or thread locks, two threads sharing the same
HSTS data could end up doing a double free or use after free.

## INFO

This feature was not implemented to support sharing between threads.
That is still left for future improvements. The fix for this issue is
therefore a documentation update clarifying that sharing HSTS between
threads is not expected to work.

CWE-415: Double Free

Severity: Low

Severity is set to Low because

* Not widely used functionality
* The timing necessary to trigger this has to match fairly exact
* Exploiting this for anything but denial of service is difficult

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.88.0](vuln-7.88.0.html) to and including [7.88.1](vuln-7.88.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.88.0](vuln-7.88.0.html) and curl >= [8.0.0](vuln-8.0.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/076a2f629119222a>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/dca4cdf071be0>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Do not share HSTS data between threads

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on March 8 2023. We
contacted distros@openwall on March 13, 2023.

curl [8.0.0](vuln-8.0.0.html) was released on March 20 2023, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
