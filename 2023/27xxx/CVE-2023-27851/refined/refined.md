  "CVE-2023-27851": {
    "root_cause": "The lighttpd configuration for the device is configured to execute any php code in the “/webs” directory by default when browsed to.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload leading to arbitrary code execution."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the device.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker places malicious code, such as a php webshell, into a shared directory and then visits the file via HTTP, causing the code to execute.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires upload permissions to a shared folder on the vulnerable device."

  "CVE-2023-27850": {
    "root_cause": "The ReadyShare functionality automatically shares the contents of an inserted USB drive or other configured network share which can be accessed via FTP or unauthenticated HTTP.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file sharing implementation allowing for symlink attacks."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can reveal and modify arbitrary files on the device.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker configures a share or inserts a USB drive with specially crafted symlinks, and then accesses the share.",

      "impact": "Code execution is possible, but is unreliable due to other security features. A segmentation fault leading to a crash of the http service can occur.",
