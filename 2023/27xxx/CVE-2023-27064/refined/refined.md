The provided content relates to CVE-2023-27064.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `formDelDnsForward` function within the `/bin/httpd` file of the Tenda V15EV1.0 router firmware. Specifically, the `indexSet` variable receives parameters without proper length validation before being copied using the `strcpy()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow: The lack of input validation on the `index` parameter allows an attacker to send a string longer than the allocated buffer for `indexSet`, causing a buffer overflow when `strcpy()` is used.
- Use of `strcpy()`: The use of `strcpy()` is vulnerable to buffer overflows since it doesn't perform any bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Sending a crafted POST request with an oversized `index` parameter can crash the `httpd` process, leading to a denial of service.
- Arbitrary code execution: By carefully crafting the oversized `index` parameter, it's possible to overwrite the return address on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attack is carried out by sending a malicious POST request to the `/goform/delDNSForward` endpoint with a crafted `index` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. This could be from the local network or, in some scenarios, remotely if the device is exposed to the internet.
- No authentication is explicitly stated as being needed for exploitation in the document, although the router may have some auth requirements.
