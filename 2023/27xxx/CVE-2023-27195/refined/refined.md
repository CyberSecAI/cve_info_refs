{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An access control issue allows unauthenticated attackers to access a specific URL path and retrieve the last registration access code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Broken Access Control",
     "Exposure of sensitive information (registration access code)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Privilege escalation / authentication bypass. Attackers can register new user accounts, including administrator accounts with full rights and privileges if the retrieved access code was used for administrator registration.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Accessing a specific URL to retrieve the last access code.",
    "Sending a PUT request to create a new user account using the retrieved access code."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET and PUT requests to the target server. No prior authentication is required."
