- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When a plugin is uploaded from an administrator's computer, Jenkins creates a temporary file in the system temporary directory with default file permissions. These default permissions are often overly permissive.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure file permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system can read and write the temporary file before it is installed, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller file system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs low-level access to the Jenkins controller file system. They can be a user with the ability to upload plugins, but also a malicious actor who has compromised the server.

The advisory also provides mitigation and remediation information, such as updating Jenkins to version 2.394, LTS 2.375.4, or LTS 2.387.1 and setting a different path as your default temporary directory using the Java system property `java.io.tmpdir`.
