- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists because IBM Safer Payments had older TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols enabled by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of outdated TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The document does not specify the specific impact of exploiting the usage of the older TLS versions, but generally, using outdated TLS versions can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, and data manipulation due to known weaknesses in these protocols.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the older TLS protocols during communication with IBM Safer Payments.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic between a client and the IBM Safer Payments server.
