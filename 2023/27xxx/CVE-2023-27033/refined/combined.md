**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: DO NOT REPORT VULNERABILITIES SOLELY TO THE AUTHOR OR MARKETPLACE.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities directly to us. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of the PrestaShop ecosystem. Unfortunately, many module developers may not always recognize or acknowledge the vulnerabilities in their code, whether due to lack of awareness, or inability to properly evaluate the associated risk, or other reasons.

Given the rise in professional cybercrime networks actively seeking out these vulnerabilities, it's crucial that any potential threats are promptly addressed and the community is informed. The most effective method to do this is by publishing a CVE, like the one provided below.

Should you discover any vulnerabilities, **please report them to us at: report[@]security-presta.org** or visit [https://security-presta.org](https://security-presta.org/) for more information.

Every vulnerability report helps make the community more secure, and we are profoundly grateful for any information shared with us.

In the module “Cdesigner” (cdesigner) up to 3.2.1 (3.2.2 fix the issue), a guest can upload files with extensions .php.+ (like .php7)

Note : .php extension is correctly block so it will be harmless for most servers’s setups.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-27033](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-27033)
* **Published at**: 2023-04-06
* **Advisory source**: Friends-Of-Presta
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: cdesigner
* **Impacted release**: > 3.1.3, <= 3.2.1 (3.2.2 fix the issue)
* **Product author**: Prestaeg
* **Weakness**: [CWE-434](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)
* **Severity**: critical (10)

## Description

Important : If you use default configuration for your server, *you should be safe* - which should be the case of the majority of servers, so don’t worry too much about this CVE.

*We are forced to tag it as critical since it will be critical for some setups, but for the majority, it should be completly harmless.*

You can check if you are vulnerable by uploading files with extensions : .php3 / .php4 / .php5 / .php7 / .php8 with this content : <?php echo (21+21); - when you make a HTTP call against theses files, if you do not see 42, all is OK else, you service is vulnerable, contact without delay your hoster.

The method `CdesignerSaverotateModuleFrontController::initContent()` misuses strpos which can lead to upload .phpX files, depending on your server’s setup, which will lead to a critical vulnerability [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).

**This exploit is actively exploited in the wild**

**WARNING** : If your service is vulnerable, be warn that this exploit will bypass some WAF (base64 payloads)
