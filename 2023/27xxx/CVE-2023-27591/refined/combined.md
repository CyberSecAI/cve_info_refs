### @fguillot **[fguillot](/fguillot)** commented [Mar 12, 2023](#issue-1620233580)

HTTP headers like X-Forwarded-For or X-Real-Ip can be easily spoofed. As such, it cannot be used to test if the client IP is allowed.

The recommendation is to use HTTP Basic authentication to protect the metrics endpoint, or run Miniflux behind a trusted reverse-proxy.

Do you follow the guidelines?

* I have tested my changes
* I read this document: <https://miniflux.app/faq.html#pull-request>

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Unauthenticated user can bypass allowed networks check to obtain Prometheus metrics

Low

[fguillot](/fguillot)
published
GHSA-3qjf-qh38-x73v
Mar 17, 2023

## Package

gomod

miniflux.app
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= 2.0.42

## Patched versions

2.0.43

## Description

### Impact

An unauthenticated user can retrieve Prometheus metrics from a publicly reachable Miniflux instance where the `METRICS_COLLECTOR` [configuration option](https://miniflux.app/docs/configuration.html#metrics-collector) is enabled and `METRICS_ALLOWED_NETWORKS` is set to `127.0.0.1/8` (the default).

### Patches

PR [#1745](https://github.com/miniflux/v2/pull/1745) fixes the problem. Available in Miniflux >= 2.0.43.

### Workarounds

Set `METRICS_COLLECTOR` to `false` (default) or run Miniflux behind a trusted reverse-proxy.

### References

* <https://miniflux.app/docs/configuration.html#metrics-collector>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[`ab209df`](/miniflux/v2/commit/ab209df78f41cfd2e3b273682e29c492351575d1)

* Avoid XSS when opening a broken image due to unescaped ServerError in proxy handler (CVE-2023-27592)

  Creating an RSS feed item with the inline description containing an `<img>` tag

  with a `srcset` attribute pointing to an invalid URL like

  `http:a<script>alert(1)</script>`, we can coerce the proxy handler into an error

  condition where the invalid URL is returned unescaped and in full.

  This results in JavaScript execution on the Miniflux instance as soon as the

  user is convinced to open the broken image.
* Use `r.RemoteAddr` to check `/metrics` endpoint network access (CVE-2023-27591)

  HTTP headers like `X-Forwarded-For` or `X-Real-Ip` can be easily spoofed. As

  such, it cannot be used to test if the client IP is allowed.

  The recommendation is to use HTTP Basic authentication to protect the

  metrics endpoint, or run Miniflux behind a trusted reverse-proxy.
* Add HTTP Basic authentication for `/metrics` endpoint
* Add proxy support for several media types
* Parse feed categories from RSS, Atom and JSON feeds
* Ignore empty link when discovering feeds
* Disable CGO explicitly to make sure the binary is statically linked
* Add CSS classes to differentiate between category/feed/entry view and icons
* Add rewrite and scraper rules for `blog.cloudflare.com`
* Add `color-scheme` to themes
* Add new keyboard shortcut to toggle open/close entry attachments section
* Sanitizer: allow `id` attribute in `<sup>` element
* Add Indonesian Language
* Update translations
* Update Docker Compose examples:

  + Run the application in one command
  + Bring back the health check condition to `depends_on`
  + Remove deprecated `version` element
* Update scraping rules for `ilpost.it`
* Bump `github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery` from `1.8.0` to `1.8.1`
* Bump `github.com/tdewolff/minify/v2` from `2.12.4` to `2.12.5`
* Bump `github.com/yuin/goldmark` from `1.5.3` to `1.5.4`
* Bump `golang.org/x/*` dependencies

## Configuration File [¶](#config-file "Permalink")

The configuration file is optional. It’s a text file that follow these rules:

* Miniflux expects each line to be in `KEY=VALUE` format.
* Lines beginning with `#` are processed as comments and ignored.
* Blank lines are ignored.
* There is no variable interpolation.

Keys are the same as the environment variables described above.

Example:

```
DEBUG=on
WORKER_POOL_SIZE=20

```

Environment variables override the values defined in the config file.

To specify a configuration file, use the command line argument `-config-file` or `-c`.

You can also dump interpreted values with the flag `-config-dump` for debugging.

Systemd uses the file `/etc/miniflux.conf` to populate environment variables.
