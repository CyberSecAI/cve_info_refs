The provided content relates to CVE-2023-27479.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper escaping of UIX parameters within the `PanelsCode.ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet` document. Specifically, the `label` parameter of an `XWiki.UIExtensionClass` object was not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') (CWE-95)
- Lack of proper input sanitization/escaping in the `PanelsCode.ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet` document when rendering the `label` parameter of UI extensions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation from a user account to programming rights, allowing execution of arbitrary code (Groovy, Python, Velocity).
- Complete compromise of the XWiki installation due to the ability to execute arbitrary code.
- Access to sensitive information and potential data breaches due to the ability to run code with high privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack by a user with view rights.
- The attacker needs to be able to create an `XWiki.UIExtensionClass` object in a document they can edit (e.g., their user profile).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Must have an account with basic user privileges.
- Must be able to edit a document (e.g., user profile) to add the malicious UI extension.
- No user interaction is required beyond the initial setup.
