#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. As a user without script or programming rights, open your user profile (or any other document you can edit) with the object editor (requires enabling the advanced mode).
2. Create a new object of kind XWiki.UIExtensionClass
3. Set "Extension Point ID" to org.xwiki.platform.panels.Applications
4. Set "Extension ID" to org.xwiki.platform.myuserApplication
5. Set "Extension Parameters" to
   ```
   order=100
   label={{/html}} {{async async="true" cached="false" context="doc.reference"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello " + "from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}
   icon=pencil
   target=XWiki.username
   ```
6. Set "Extension Scope" to "Current User"
7. Click "Save & View"
8. Open PanelsCode.ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet (i.e., <xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/view/PanelsCode/ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet where <xwiki-host> is the URL of your XWiki installation).

**Expected result:**

The applications are listed, an application with label

```
{{/html}} {{async async="true" cached="false" context="doc.reference"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello " + "from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}
```

is included in the list.

**Actual result:**

The message

```
Failed to execute the [html] macro. Cause: [When using HTML content inline, you can only use inline HTML content. Block HTML content (such as tables) cannot be displayed. Try leaving an empty line before and after the macro.]. Click on this message for details.
Hello from groovy!</a>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
{{/html}}
```

is displayed, the list of applications isn't displayed. This demonstrates that a Groovy defined by the user has been successfully executed, or, in other words, a privilege escalation attack from account to programming rights. This is because the document PanelsCode.ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet doesn't properly escape all displayed parameters.

# Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-panels-ui

Critical

[vmassol](/vmassol)
published
GHSA-qxjg-jhgw-qhrv
Mar 7, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-panels-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 6.3-milestone-2

## Patched versions

13.10.11, 14.4.7, 14.10-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

Any user with view rights can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation. The root cause is improper escaping of UIX parameters

A proof of concept exploit is to log in, add an `XWiki.UIExtensionClass` xobject to the user profile page, with an Extension Parameters content of:

```
order=100
label={{/html}} {{async async="true" cached="false" context="doc.reference"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello " + "from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}
icon=icon:pencil
target=XWiki.username

```

Then, navigating to `PanelsCode.ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet` (i.e., `<xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/view/PanelsCode/ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet` where `<xwiki-host>` is the URL of your XWiki installation) should not execute the Groovy script. If it does, you will see `Hello from groovy!` displayed on the screen.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.7 and 14.10-rc-1

### Workarounds

The issue can be fixed by editing the `PanelsCode.ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet` wiki page and making the same modifications as shown in the [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/6de5442f3c91c3634a66c7b458d5b142e1c2a2dc) for this issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
