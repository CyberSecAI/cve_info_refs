Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-27485:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient authorization checks when accessing subresults for submissions. Specifically, the system allowed logged-in users to query subresults of other users' submissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Authorization:** The primary weakness was the lack of proper authorization checks when retrieving subtask results. The system did not verify if the user requesting the subresults was the owner of the submission or had sufficient privileges to view those results.
- **Information Disclosure:** Due to the missing authorization, the system leaked sensitive information (subtask results) that should have been restricted to the submission owner.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Subresults:** A logged-in user could view subtask results of submissions made by other users.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Although the subresults could not be directly linked to a specific user, this access still represented a breach of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability was accessible over the network through the API endpoint used for retrieving subresults.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needed to be a logged-in user of the feedback system.
- No special privileges were required other than having a valid user account.
- The attacker had to send a specific API request to get subresults from a submission by using a known submission id and configuration id.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.5.3 of the software.
- The fix was implemented in commit `f1ae67d8bb2286a8eb15949038473d41b1358493`.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity.
- The vulnerable API endpoint is `get/users/{uid}/courses/{cid}/tasks/{tid}/submissions/{sid}/subresults`.
- The issue is tracked as GHSA-fhq8-p3w6-mmgr
