| I've discovered that a while ago too and contacted the maintainer about it on the 2023-02-16., but they didn't respond yet.  If anyone is interested in a fork of microbin by... well, me (which fixes that and adds some other features that were requested here), here is the link to the repo: <https://gitlab.com/obsidianical/microbin> |

| There are more severe things:   * The service is not handling invalid UTF-8 data well and panics. This keeps the lock on the "database" poisoned rendering the service inaccessible. * The service keeps a lock while operating on its database, making async kind of pointless. * The service serializes and writes the *entire* database file to disk each time a pasta is fetched. This will not scale well in the long run.   Disclaimer: I write a similar [service](https://github.com/matze/wastebin) … |

| Microbins json database is a joke. I'm aware of that. It's kinda a high priority TODO for my fork at the moment.  How do I reproduce the UTF-8 data thing? I'm gonna look into fixing that ASAP if I can diagnose it |

| I've tried crashing a local dev instance, and I haven't been able to, even after pasting a raw binary program, random bytes, and a stress tester file for invalid UTF-8. I don't think that'll cause many problems, since triggering this issue at all was quite impossible to me so far. If you can provide a sample of a string that does crash it, please do. |

| It does not crash the entire server because actix installs a panic handler but it renders the upload and a few other endpoints useless. Try  ``` wget https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-test.txt curl -F "expiration=10min" -F content=@UTF-8-test.txt -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8080/upload  ```  From now on, every time you try to paste something either via the REST endpoint or the UI, it will fail with  ``` thread 'actix-rt|system:0|arbiter:0' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: PoisonError { .. }', src/endpoints/create.rs:40:41  ```  Edit: also the List and Info endpoints do not work anymore. |

| While there seems to be an error, pasting still seems to work on my fork. It seems that I fixed the problem preventing pasting (by accident)  The fix seems to have been that I switched to an async aware mutex for another unrelated reason, which seems to unlock after a thread crashes. |

| Thanks a lot [@7a6163](https://github.com/7a6163) for [#143](https://github.com/szabodanika/microbin/pull/143)! I apologise, I had to put aside personal projects as I was very busy with work and studies. I am back on working on v1.3.0 release now, cleaning up backlog in priority order. I am an active user of this software, therefore it will never be abandoned. |
