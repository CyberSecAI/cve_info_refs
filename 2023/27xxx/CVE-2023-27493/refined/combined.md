# Envoy doesn't escape HTTP header values

High

[phlax](/phlax)
published
GHSA-w5w5-487h-qv8q
Apr 4, 2023

## Package

Envoy
(Envoy)

## Affected versions

< 1.26.0

## Patched versions

1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, 1.22.9

## Description

### Impact

Request smuggling and bypass of security policies.

### Affected components

HTTP

### Attack vector/s

A specifically constructed HTTP request or mTLS connection with a specifically crafted client certificate.

Envoy configuration must also include an option to add request headers that were generated using inputs from the request, i.e. the peer certificate SAN.

### Description

Envoy does not sanitize or escape request properties when generating request headers. This can lead to characters that are illegal in header values to be sent to the upstream service.

In the worst case it can cause upstream service to interpret the original request as two pipelined requests, possibly bypassing the intent of Envoy’s security policy.

### Example exploit or proof-of-concept

First add a configuration to add request headers on requests to upstream.

```
+                request_headers_to_add:
+                  - header:
+                      key: x-foo
+                      value: "%DOWNSTREAM_PEER_FINGERPRINT_256%  %DOWNSTREAM_PEER_URI_SAN%"
```

Then with curl:

```
curl -v --cacert test/config/integration/certs/servercert.pem --cert /tmp/clientcert.pem --key /tmp/clientkey.pem https://lyft.com:10000 --resolve lyft.com:10000:127.0.0.1 -H "Host: 127.0.0.1:20000"
```

The client cert/key were generated via test/config/integration/certs/certs.sh with the following patch:

```
diff --git a/test/config/integration/certs/clientcert.cfg b/test/config/integration/certs/clientcert.cfg
index 59da6cb1ee..68f913d1bd 100644

 DNS.1 = lyft.com
 DNS.2 = www.lyft.com
```
### Detection

The detection is possible if the request properties that are used to synthesize new headers are recorded in the access log. Examining the request log for presence of illegal characters, such as CR or LF, can indicate a possible attack.

### Mitigation

Disable adding request headers based on the downstream request properties, such as downstream certificate properties.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
