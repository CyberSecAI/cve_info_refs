- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked fieldpath index in Composition's patches allows users to specify an arbitrary index when inserting elements into arrays. If the specified index is greater than the current size of the target slice, the slice will be increased to that index, potentially leading to excessive memory usage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unchecked input leading to an out-of-bounds write on a slice/array.
    - Potential for arbitrary memory allocation due to the lack of validation on the specified index.
    - Vulnerability to denial of service by exhausting available memory (OOM).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause an out-of-memory (OOM) panic in Crossplane, leading to denial of service by exhausting available memory and killing the Pod.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - By creating or updating Compositions with crafted patches that specify large indices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be a highly privileged Crossplane user who has the ability to create or update Compositions.
    - The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker must be in the same network segment.
