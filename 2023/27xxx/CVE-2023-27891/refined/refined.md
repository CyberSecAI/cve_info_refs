Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-27891:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the incorrect session validation during OAuth authorization within the pretix platform.
*   The authorization dialog for third-party applications allowed users to confirm access even after their session had timed out (after the usual 12-hour login requirement).
*   The authorization process continued to function up to the general session limit of 14 days of inactivity, even after the 12-hour login timeout.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Timeout Bypass:** The OAuth authorization process did not properly enforce session timeouts, allowing authorization to proceed even when the user's session should have expired.
*   **Inadequate Validation:**  The system lacked proper validation to ensure that the user's session was still active and valid before granting OAuth authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with physical access to a user's device (browser with a valid session cookie) could potentially authorize a malicious third-party application to access the user's pretix account.
*   This could happen even if the user believed they were logged out of the system due to the 12-hour timeout.
*   The attacker would gain access to the same data stored inside pretix that the user has access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector requires physical access to the user's device, specifically a browser with a valid session cookie.
*   **Browser Session:**  Exploitation relies on the presence of a browser session that was recently logged into pretix.
*   **Third-party app:** A malicious third-party application is needed to take advantage of the authorization flow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access to Device:** The attacker must have physical access to the user's device and the ability to access the browser with the active session cookie.
*   **Knowledge of OAuth Flow:** The attacker needs to be familiar with the OAuth authorization flow to initiate the malicious authorization.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was internally discovered by the pretix team.
*   The severity is rated as **high**, due to its potential impact on login and authentication, despite the specific and rare scenario for exploitation.
*   The vulnerability affects pretix versions 1.16.0 to 4.17.0.
*   An email notification is sent to the user whenever a new third-party application is authorized, which could raise awareness of unauthorized access.
*   The fix was implemented in versions 4.17.1, 4.16.1, and 4.15.1.
