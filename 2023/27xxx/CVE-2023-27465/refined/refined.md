- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When the SIMOTION device is operated with Security Level Low, it does not properly protect access to certain debugging services.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Disclosure due to insufficient access control on debugging services when the device is in Security Level Low. Specifically, CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies is cited.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can extract confidential technology object (TO) configuration from the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the device is required. The attacker exploits unprotected debugging services while the device is operating in Security Level Low.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the device and the device needs to be in Security Level Low, which can be achieved through the Service Selector Switch in position 8.
