# Crash when a large request body is processed in Lua filter

Moderate

[phlax](/phlax)
published
GHSA-wpc2-2jp6-ppg2
Apr 4, 2023

## Package

Envoy
(Envoy)

## Affected versions

< 1.26.0

## Patched versions

1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, 1.22.9

## Description

### Impact

Denial of service (crash).

### Affected components

Lua filter.

### Attack vector/s

Attackers can send large request bodies for routes that have Lua filter enabled and trigger crashes.

### Description

The Lua filter can resume processing of the coroutine after we've sent a local reply due to request/response body being too large. This mitigation prevents coroutine invocation if we’re doing a local reply.

### Example exploit or proof-of-concept

1 Configure a route that has Lua filter enabled.

2 Send a request with a large body that is beyond the buffer limit.

3 Have the Lua script request the request body, this will cause us to buffer the entire request body.

4 The request body buffering can go over the limit here: [https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/envoyproxy/envoy@991cde892ff88b7aca04adb7fc44e14f6c0ee0fe/-/blob/source/extensions/filters/http/lua/lua\_filter.cc?L263&subtree=true#tab=references](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/envoyproxy/envoy%40991cde892ff88b7aca04adb7fc44e14f6c0ee0fe/-/blob/source/extensions/filters/http/lua/lua_filter.cc?L263&subtree=true#tab=references) and send the local reply, but the Lua filter is oblivious and continues the coroutine.

5 The Lua script kicks off a HTTP request that points to the Lua filter.

6 The Lua filter is destroyed as Envoy has completed the local reply and destroyed the related objects.

7 The HTTP request that the Lua script kicked off in step 5 has a response, and calls the Lua filter. The filter will already be destroyed, so Envoy will segfault.

### Detection

Given enough traffic of this type, Envoy would be crashing especially when the body buffered is larger.

### Mitigation

For versions updated with the patch, we no longer invoke the Lua coroutine if the filter has been reset.

For older unpatched versions you can mitigate by:

If your Lua filter is buffering all requests/ responses you can guard by using the buffer filter to avoid triggering the local reply in the Lua filter.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
