{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an infinite loop within the `squareRoot()` method of the `Integer` class in `phpseclib/Math/PrimeField/Integer.php`. Specifically, the loop condition `if ($i->compare($m) >= 0)` does not properly account for composite primefields, causing the loop to continue indefinitely.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of composite primefields leading to an infinite loop."
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of the vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. By providing a composite number as a 'prime' number when creating a PrimeField object, an attacker can trigger the infinite loop, causing the program to become unresponsive or crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a `PrimeField` object using a composite number as the modulus, which leads to the vulnerable code path.",
      "The attack vector is through the constructor of the `PrimeField` class, by providing a non-prime number as modulus, triggering the infinite loop when squareRoot() is invoked."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a composite number as a 'prime' number to the `PrimeField` constructor."
  },
  "additional_details": {
   "Affected_Versions": "Versions 3.0.0 to prior to 3.0.19 are affected.",
   "Patched_Versions": "Version 3.0.19 and later contain the fix.",
    "Commit_Fix":"The vulnerability was fixed in commit 6298d1c which modified phpseclib/Math/PrimeField.php and phpseclib/Math/PrimeField/Integer.php"
    }
