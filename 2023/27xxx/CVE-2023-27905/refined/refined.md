The provided content includes information about CVE-2023-27905.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `update-center2` tool, used to generate Jenkins update sites, renders the required Jenkins core version on plugin download index pages without sanitizing it. This version is taken directly from plugin metadata.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The unsanitized Jenkins core version allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user viewing the plugin download index page generated by a vulnerable `update-center2` instance.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to provide a plugin with malicious metadata to be hosted by an update site using a vulnerable version of `update-center2`.
- The attacker needs to have control over the plugin metadata (specifically the Jenkins core version) served by the update site.
-  The generation of download pages needs to be enabled (`--download-links-directory` argument needs to be set).
- A custom download page template must be used (`--index-template-url` argument), and the template used must not prevent JavaScript execution through `Content-Security-Policy`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a plugin with malicious metadata for hosting on an update site generated by a vulnerable version of `update-center2`.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on Jenkins instances that use the vulnerable update site.
