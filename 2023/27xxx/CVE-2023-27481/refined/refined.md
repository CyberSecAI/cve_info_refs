Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to filter on hashed/concealed fields using the `_starts_with` operator within the Directus export functionality. This allowed attackers to potentially enumerate password hashes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of password hashes.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The application failed to restrict the use of filter operators on sensitive fields, specifically allowing `_starts_with` on hashed values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Password Hash Extraction:** An attacker with read access to the `password` field in the `directus_users` table could extract argon2 password hashes.
- **Brute Force Attacks:** Extracted hashes could be used in offline brute-force attacks to recover user passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited via network requests to the Directus API.
- **Export Functionality:** The attack leverages the export feature with a crafted filter using the `_starts_with` operator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Directus User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user with at least read access to the `password` field within the `directus_users` table.
- **API Access:** The attacker must be able to make API requests to the Directus instance.
- **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker needs to know how to use the export functionality and how to apply filters, specifically the `_starts_with` operator.

**Mitigation:**
- **Restricted Filter Operators:** The vulnerability was mitigated by preventing any filtering (specifically the `_starts_with` operator) on hashed/concealed fields. Only `null` filter operators are allowed for such fields.
- **Access Control:** Ensure that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users` table to prevent unauthorized access to password hashes.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix was implemented in two pull requests: [#14829](https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/14829) and [#15010](https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/15010).
-  The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-200 (Information Exposure)
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5, with High Confidentiality and Integrity impact but No Availability impact.
