# Extract password hashes through export querying

Moderate

[br41nslug](/br41nslug)
published
GHSA-m5q3-8wgf-x8xf
Mar 7, 2023

## Package

npm

directus
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 9.16.0

## Patched versions

9.16.0

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

Users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

The problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Ensuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users` is sufficient to prevent this vulnerability.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

[#14829](https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/14829) & [#15010](https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/15010)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
