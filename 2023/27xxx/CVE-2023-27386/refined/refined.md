- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled search path in IntelÂ® Pathfinder for RISC-V software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled search path allows for potential privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user can potentially escalate their privileges via local access.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated user with local access. The attacker also needs to trick the system to load a malicious library using the uncontrolled search path (this is implied by the "User Interaction" flag in CVSS score, which requires the user to execute some malicious code or trigger an operation).

The provided information is more detailed than the CVE description by including CVSS score and vector, affected products, and recommendations. It also confirms the product is discontinued.
