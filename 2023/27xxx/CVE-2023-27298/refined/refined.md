- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An uncontrolled search path vulnerability exists in the Wake Up Latency Tracer (WULT) software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly control the search path, leading to potential privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated user to achieve escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access and must be an unauthenticated user. User interaction is required, as indicated by the CVSS vector UI:R.
