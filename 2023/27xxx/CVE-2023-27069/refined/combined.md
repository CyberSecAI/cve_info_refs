| Tested version: [b80b09d](https://github.com/totaljs/openplatform/commit/b80b09d1e12ada675d0cbb6d9c4af9e5a8097751) (latest)  Steps to reproduce the vulnerability:   * Login in the application. * Click on user profile picture in the right corner below. * Click My Account * Set `"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>` as account name and save. * XSS fires. * Each time a target will visit the dashboard the payload will fire, even if the target is not logged in! In order to test this, just click logout and reload the page.

| Thank you, I already fixed it in my own adding .removeTags(); but I think there are better ways as ui-bind, validator, etc.. this is the easy fix. :)  [Captura de pantalla 2023-02-19 a las 20 00 53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57091288/219969318-9997a7e4-0a01-4051-9fb2-ef5cbff06fa6.png) |

| don't rely on these naive solutions, there are specific libraries to sanitize input. you can use symbols in input fields but simply they will be rendered as pure text and not html. |
