Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-27596:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `codec_delete_XX()` functions in the `sipmsgops` module of OpenSIPS. Specifically, the issue arises during the processing of malformed SDP bodies when using the `stream_process` function. The vulnerability was triggered during coverage-guided fuzzing of the `codec_delete_except_re` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a parsing issue within the `codec_delete_XX()` functions when dealing with malformed SDP bodies. The specific code change in the commit `dd051f8ed5ae3347fb1d556ced3c97822c9d8450` indicates a fix related to trimming trailing whitespace in the payload. This suggests that the vulnerability was related to incorrect handling of whitespace when parsing SDP data, leading to a crash when a malformed SDP is sent multiple times when using `stream_process`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash the OpenSIPS server. The impact is a denial of service (DoS), rendering the server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker sends specially crafted SIP messages containing malformed SDP bodies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send SIP messages to the vulnerable OpenSIPS server. No special privileges or user interaction is required. The attacker must send multiple malformed SDP bodies to trigger the crash.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenSIPS versions 3.2 and earlier.
- Patched versions are 3.1.8 and 3.2.5.
- The vulnerability was discovered during a security audit of OpenSIPS.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.5, with an attack vector of Network, low attack complexity, no privileges required, and high impact on availability.
- The specific commit that fixed the issue is `dd051f8ed5ae3347fb1d556ced3c97822c9d8450`.
