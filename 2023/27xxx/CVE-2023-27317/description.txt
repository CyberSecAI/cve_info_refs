ONTAP 9 versions 9.12.1P8, 9.13.1P4, and 9.13.1P5 are susceptible to a 
vulnerability which will cause all SAS-attached FIPS 140-2 drives to 
become unlocked after a system reboot or power cycle or a single 
SAS-attached FIPS 140-2 drive to become unlocked after reinsertion. This
 could lead to disclosure of sensitive information to an attacker with 
physical access to the unlocked drives.
