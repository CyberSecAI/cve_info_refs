```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A vulnerability in ONTAP 9 causes SAS-attached FIPS 140-2 drives to become unlocked after a system reboot, power cycle, or reinsertion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability results in all SAS-attached FIPS 140-2 drives being unlocked after a system reboot or power cycle, or a single SAS-attached FIPS 140-2 drive being unlocked after reinsertion. This bypasses the intended security mechanism of the drives.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to disclosure of sensitive information to an attacker with physical access to the unlocked drives.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is physical access to the storage system and its drives, either after a system reboot/power cycle or after a drive reinsertion.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs physical access to the affected NetApp ONTAP system's unlocked drives to exploit this vulnerability."
