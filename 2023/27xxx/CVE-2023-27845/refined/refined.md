  "CVE-2023-27845": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The KerAwen Omnichannel Stocks module for PrestaShop is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `ocs_id_cart` and `ocs_checkout_session_data` variables.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The module fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `KerawenHelper::setCartOperationInfo()` and `KerawenHelper::resetCheckoutSessionData()` functions before using it in SQL queries.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:\n- Obtaining admin access.\n- Removing data from the associated PrestaShop.\n- Copying/pasting data from sensitive tables to the front-end, exposing tokens and unlocking admin's ajax scripts.\n- Rewriting SMTP settings to hijack emails.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An anonymous user can perform SQL injection through the POST or GET requests by submitting malicious values in `ocs_id_cart` or `ocs_checkout_session_data` parameters.",
       "additional_info": "The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 1.4.1. The fix involves casting the `$id_cart` variable to an integer before using it in SQL queries and using pSQL for sanitizing the data parameter."
