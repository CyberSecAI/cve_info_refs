The provided content describes a remote code execution vulnerability in Databasir version 1.0.7.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `SpelScriptEvaluator` class uses `StandardEvaluationContext` to evaluate SpEL expressions, which allows for arbitrary code execution through the `script` parameter. The `script` parameter is not filtered, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of `StandardEvaluationContext` instead of `SimpleEvaluationContext`, which exposes full SpEL language features without restrictions.
- Lack of input sanitization or validation on the `script` parameter of `SpelScriptEvaluator`, which allows for injection of arbitrary SpEL expressions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Databasir application. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exposed via the `saveMockRules` endpoint, which accepts a list of `ColumnMockRuleSaveRequest` objects. The `mockDataScript` parameter of these objects is vulnerable to SpEL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable `saveMockRules` endpoint. They also need to be authenticated with one of the following roles:  `SYS_OWNER`, `GROUP_OWNER` or  `GROUP_MEMBER`. They need to be able to craft a request containing a malicious SpEL expression within the `mockDataScript` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability. The POC uses a SpEL expression to execute the `open -a Calculator` command on the server.
- The recommended fix is to replace `StandardEvaluationContext` with `SimpleEvaluationContext`, which limits the available SpEL features and prevents arbitrary code execution.
