- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption while parsing specially crafted SPP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: By tricking a user into opening a malicious SPP file using the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious SPP file and convince a user to open it. No special privileges or network access is required as the attack vector is local user interaction.
