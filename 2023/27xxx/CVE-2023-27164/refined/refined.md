*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation can lead to XSS attacks. When the malicious Javascript within the uploaded Markdown file gets executed in a user's browser.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information via JavaScript code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted malicious file via an HTTP request to the vulnerable API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of the Halo blogging platform to utilize the import functionality.
