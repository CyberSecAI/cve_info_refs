[![We are proud to participate in the United Nations @GlobalCompact (UNGC), which will help us better align our global sustainability efforts. Recently, our sustainability committee members, Karla Border and Phil Peden, attended in-person sessions in NYC as part of the SDG #ClimateAmbitionAccelerator program. This program aims to provide actionable guidance and empower us to set ambitious corporate targets aligned with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We are excited to share updates on our progress soon!

# halo <= 1.6.1 file upload details
## Acknowledgment
\*\*Credit to [@beet1e](https://github.com/b33t1e) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and [@chenlibo147](chenlibo147@mail.sdu.edu.cn) , [@houqinsheng](houqinsheng@mail.sdu.edu.cn), 202037049@mail.sdu.edu.cn from Shandong University.\*\*
## Vulnerability description
Follow the official documentation to start forem with docker installation.
![](https://notes.sjtu.edu.cn/uploads/upload\_8ca1b7d03a3716212c98cb71d6eed4cc.png)
Then, we log into the administrator background:
![](https://notes.sjtu.edu.cn/uploads/upload\_87d28ec3e5874af85c858eb63e31ddb0.png)
Here we can use the import function to import articles in md format.
This function corresponds to the API - /api/admin/backups/markdown/import, this API is capable of uploading malicious files.
We use following file to upload:
```
<script>alert("XSS")</script>
```
![](https://notes.sjtu.edu.cn/uploads/upload\_a486f6dda45fb325b61ba46c1d65b8e8.png)
The file will be uploaded successfully：
![](https://notes.sjtu.edu.cn/uploads/upload\_3a08dc0863bbd778594e2db54ce9ed1c.png)
When someone read this article, the JavaScript code will be executed.
![](https://notes.sjtu.edu.cn/uploads/upload\_a4b70ad3074f07a04c73fd696d9f542f.png)
![](https://notes.sjtu.edu.cn/uploads/upload\_41cb02ac482c0497e8ea0e43a48c5adf.png)
So, the API - /api/admin/backups/markdown/import has a malicious file upload vulnerability.
