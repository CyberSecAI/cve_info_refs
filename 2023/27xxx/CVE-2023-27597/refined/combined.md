High

[razvancrainea](/razvancrainea)
published
GHSA-358f-935m-7p9c
Mar 15, 2023

## Package

opensips
(OpenSIPS Core)

## Affected versions

<=3.2

## Patched versions

3.1.8, 3.2.5

## Description

When a specially crafted SIP message is processed by the function `rewrite_ruri`, a crash occurs due to

a segmentation fault. The following backtrace was observed when reproducing this issue:

```
Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
#0 0x000055eabf2f9b87 in memcpy (__len=<optimized out>, __src=<optimized out>,
__dest=0x7f2223b36ea8) at parser/msg_parser.c:1156
1156 if (tmp){
(gdb) bt
#0 0x000055eabf2f9b87 in memcpy (__len=<optimized out>, __src=<optimized out>,
__dest=0x7f2223b36ea8) at parser/msg_parser.c:1156
#1 rewrite_ruri (msg=0x7f2223b362f8, sval=0x7fff665344c8, ival=ival@entry=0,

#2 0x000055eabf1b4576 in w_setport (msg=<optimized out>, port=<optimized out>) at
core_cmds.c:754

```
### Impact

This issue causes the server to crash. It affects configurations containing functions that make use of the

affected code, such as the function `setport`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
