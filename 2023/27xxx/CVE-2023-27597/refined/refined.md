Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the `parse_uri()` function in `parser/msg_parser.c` of OpenSIPS. Specifically, when processing a specially crafted SIP message with the `rewrite_ruri` function, it leads to a segmentation fault due to an issue with memory handling in the `memcpy` function.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The root cause is related to how the function handles memory when parsing URIs which leads to a crash. The vulnerability occurs specifically in `parser/msg_parser.c` at line 1156 within the `memcpy` function call.
- **Segmentation Fault:** A crafted SIP message triggers a segmentation fault, resulting in a crash of the OpenSIPS server. This is directly caused by an invalid memory access within the `memcpy` call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a server crash, rendering the OpenSIPS service unavailable. This can interrupt communication services that rely on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is through the network. An attacker can send a malicious SIP message to the vulnerable OpenSIPS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send SIP messages to the vulnerable OpenSIPS server.
- **Crafted SIP Message:** The attacker needs to craft a specific SIP message that triggers the vulnerability in the `parse_uri()` function.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without the need for authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is related to the `rewrite_ruri` function which utilizes the `parse_uri()` function.
- The vulnerability specifically affects OpenSIPS versions <= 3.2 and is fixed in versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5.
- The provided commit ([b2dffe4](https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/b2dffe4b5cd81182c9c8eabb6c96aac96c7acfe3)) addresses this issue.
