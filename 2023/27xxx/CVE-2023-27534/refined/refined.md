Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2023-27534:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in the `curl` SFTP implementation.
*   The tilde (~) character, intended to denote a user's home directory, is incorrectly processed. It's not only replaced when used as the first element, but also when used as a prefix in the first path element (e.g. `/~2/foo`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The incorrect handling of the tilde character allows for path manipulation that can bypass intended restrictions and access unintended locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Filtering:** Attackers can use paths like `/~2/foo` to circumvent filters or security checks that might otherwise prevent access to certain resources.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, the possibility of arbitrary code execution is mentioned in the context of SOCKS usage. The provided documents, however, focus more on the path traversal aspect.
*   **Access to unintended locations:** The vulnerability could allow access to files/directories outside the intended user's home directory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted SFTP URLs:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted SFTP URL with a tilde character used as a prefix in the first path element.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to make SFTP connections:** An attacker needs to be able to initiate SFTP transfers using a vulnerable version of `curl`.
*   **Knowledge of the target system:** The attacker needs to know, or guess, valid user home directories to target in the path manipulation.
*   **Ability to influence the target URL:** The attacker must be able to control or influence the construction of the URL used by the vulnerable curl instance.

**Additional Details (from non-CVE descriptions):**

*   The issue is described as a "SFTP path ~ resolving discrepancy."
*   The incorrect tilde handling was introduced in commit `ba6f20a244`.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `4e2b52b5f7a3bf50`.
*   The risk of remote code execution is limited to SOCKS usage
*   Multiple vendors such as Debian, Fedora and NetApp were impacted.
