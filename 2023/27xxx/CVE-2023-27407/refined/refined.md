- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web-based management interface of the affected device does not properly validate user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection (CWE-77) due to improper neutralization of special elements used in a command.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated remote attacker could gain access to the underlying operating system as the root user, allowing for complete control of the device. This would impact confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have remote access to the web-based management interface.
