- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `formPortalAuth` function in `/bin/httpd` uses `strcpy()` to copy the `gotoUrl` parameter without checking its length, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow due to lack of input validation on the `gotoUrl` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A denial-of-service (DoS) condition is achieved by overflowing the buffer, causing the httpd process to crash.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/PortalAuth` with a large `gotoUrl` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. The provided example uses the IP `192.168.75.201`.
