## Configuration File [¶](#config-file "Permalink")

The configuration file is optional. It’s a text file that follow these rules:

* Miniflux expects each line to be in `KEY=VALUE` format.
* Lines beginning with `#` are processed as comments and ignored.
* Blank lines are ignored.
* There is no variable interpolation.

Keys are the same as the environment variables described above.

Example:

```
DEBUG=on
WORKER_POOL_SIZE=20

```

Environment variables override the values defined in the config file.

To specify a configuration file, use the command line argument `-config-file` or `-c`.

You can also dump interpreted values with the flag `-config-dump` for debugging.

Systemd uses the file `/etc/miniflux.conf` to populate environment variables.

[`ab209df`](/miniflux/v2/commit/ab209df78f41cfd2e3b273682e29c492351575d1)

* Avoid XSS when opening a broken image due to unescaped ServerError in proxy handler (CVE-2023-27592)

  Creating an RSS feed item with the inline description containing an `<img>` tag

  with a `srcset` attribute pointing to an invalid URL like

  `http:a<script>alert(1)</script>`, we can coerce the proxy handler into an error

  condition where the invalid URL is returned unescaped and in full.

  This results in JavaScript execution on the Miniflux instance as soon as the

  user is convinced to open the broken image.
* Use `r.RemoteAddr` to check `/metrics` endpoint network access (CVE-2023-27591)

  HTTP headers like `X-Forwarded-For` or `X-Real-Ip` can be easily spoofed. As

  such, it cannot be used to test if the client IP is allowed.

  The recommendation is to use HTTP Basic authentication to protect the

  metrics endpoint, or run Miniflux behind a trusted reverse-proxy.
* Add HTTP Basic authentication for `/metrics` endpoint
* Add proxy support for several media types
* Parse feed categories from RSS, Atom and JSON feeds
* Ignore empty link when discovering feeds
* Disable CGO explicitly to make sure the binary is statically linked
* Add CSS classes to differentiate between category/feed/entry view and icons
* Add rewrite and scraper rules for `blog.cloudflare.com`
* Add `color-scheme` to themes
* Add new keyboard shortcut to toggle open/close entry attachments section
* Sanitizer: allow `id` attribute in `<sup>` element
* Add Indonesian Language
* Update translations
* Update Docker Compose examples:

  + Run the application in one command
  + Bring back the health check condition to `depends_on`
  + Remove deprecated `version` element
* Update scraping rules for `ilpost.it`
* Bump `github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery` from `1.8.0` to `1.8.1`
* Bump `github.com/tdewolff/minify/v2` from `2.12.4` to `2.12.5`
* Bump `github.com/yuin/goldmark` from `1.5.3` to `1.5.4`
* Bump `golang.org/x/*` dependencies

## Affected versions

<= 2.0.42

## Patched versions

2.0.43

## Description

### Impact

Since [v2.0.25](https://github.com/miniflux/v2/releases/tag/2.0.25), Miniflux will automatically [proxy](https://miniflux.app/docs/configuration.html#proxy-images) images served over HTTP to prevent mixed content errors.

When an outbound request made by the Go HTTP client fails, the `html.ServerError` is [returned](https://github.com/miniflux/v2/blob/b2fd84e0d376a3af6329b9bb2e772ce38a25c31c/ui/proxy.go#L76) unescaped without the expected Content Security Policy [header](https://github.com/miniflux/v2/blob/b2fd84e0d376a3af6329b9bb2e772ce38a25c31c/ui/proxy.go#L90) added to valid responses.

By creating an RSS feed item with the inline description containing an `<img>` tag with a `srcset` attribute pointing to an invalid URL like `http:a<script>alert(1)</script>`, we can coerce the proxy handler into an error condition where the invalid URL is returned unescaped and in full.

This results in JavaScript execution on the Miniflux instance as soon as the user is convinced (e.g. by a message in the alt text) to open the broken image.

An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a victim Miniflux user when they open a broken image in a crafted RSS feed. This can be used to perform actions on the Miniflux instance as that user and gain administrative access to the Miniflux instance if it is reachable and the victim is an administrator.

### Patches

PR [#1746](https://github.com/miniflux/v2/pull/1746) fixes the problem. Available in Miniflux >= 2.0.43.

### Workarounds

* Disable image proxy (default value is `http-only`).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @fguillot **[fguillot](/fguillot)** commented [Mar 13, 2023](#issue-1620783745)

Creating an RSS feed item with the inline description containing an `<img>` tag with a `srcset` attribute pointing to an invalid URL like `http:a<script>alert(1)</script>`, we can coerce the proxy handler into an error condition where the invalid URL is returned unescaped and in full.

This results in JavaScript execution on the Miniflux instance as soon as the user is convinced to open the broken image.

Do you follow the guidelines?

* I have tested my changes
