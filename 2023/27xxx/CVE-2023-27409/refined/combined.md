GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE LPE9000 (Local Processing Engine) extends the SCALANCE family portfolio by a component
that provides computing power for a wide range of applications in the network, close to the process –
Edge Computing.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-27407

The web based management of affected device does not properly validate user input, making it
susceptible to command injection. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to access the
underlying operating system as the root user.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-27408

The i2c mutex ﬁle is created with the permissions bits of -rw-rw-rw-. This ﬁle is used as a mutex for
multiple applications interacting with i2c. This could allow an authenticated attacker with access to the
SSH interface on the affected device to interfere with the integrity of the mutex and the data it protects.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-27409

A path traversal vulnerability was found in the deviceinfo binary via the mac parameter. This could
allow an authenticated attacker with access to the SSH interface on the affected device to read the
contents of any ﬁle named address.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-27410

A heap-based buffer overﬂow vulnerability was found in the edgebox_web_app binary. The binary will
crash if supplied with a backup password longer than 255 characters. This could allow an authenticated
privileged attacker to cause a denial of service.
