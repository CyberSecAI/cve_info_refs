- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A path traversal vulnerability exists in the `deviceinfo` binary via the `mac` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read the contents of any file named `address`.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must have access to the SSH interface on the affected device. The vulnerability is triggered via the `mac` parameter within the `deviceinfo` binary.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated attacker with access to the SSH interface of the device is required.
