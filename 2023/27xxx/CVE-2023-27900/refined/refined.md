The provided document describes multiple vulnerabilities, and one of them is related to CVE-2023-27900:

**CVE-2023-27900:** This CVE is associated with the DoS vulnerability in the bundled Apache Commons FileUpload library used by Jenkins.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Apache Commons FileUpload library, which is used by Jenkins to handle uploaded files. The library is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in how the Apache Commons FileUpload library processes multipart/form-data requests. Specifically, by sending a crafted request with a large number of parts (e.g., form fields, file uploads), an attacker can cause excessive resource consumption, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial of service (DoS), making the Jenkins server unavailable or unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send specially crafted HTTP requests to Jenkins endpoints that process file uploads or handle multipart/form-data. This includes endpoints that use `StaplerRequest#getFile` or `MultipartFormDataParser` to process such requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have network access to the Jenkins server and be able to send HTTP requests to it. They need to be able to create requests with a large number of parts to trigger the vulnerability. Low privileged users can exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   Jenkins versions 2.393 and earlier, and LTS versions 2.375.3 and earlier, are affected.
*   Jenkins 2.394, LTS 2.375.4, and LTS 2.387.1 mitigate this vulnerability by limiting the number of request parts to 1000.
*   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2023-24998 (the upstream issue in Apache Commons FileUpload).
*   Jenkins introduced system properties to further limit requests:
    *   `hudson.util.MultipartFormDataParser.FILEUPLOAD_MAX_FILES` and `org.kohsuke.stapler.RequestImpl.FILEUPLOAD_MAX_FILES` to limit the number of fields
    *   `hudson.util.MultipartFormDataParser.FILEUPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE` and `org.kohsuke.stapler.RequestImpl.FILEUPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE` to limit the size of individual fields.
    *   `hudson.util.MultipartFormDataParser.FILEUPLOAD_MAX_SIZE` and `org.kohsuke.stapler.RequestImpl.FILEUPLOAD_MAX_SIZE` to limit total request size.
