  "CVE-2023-27491": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2023-27491",
      "Description": "Envoy does not reject HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 requests with the `:method` value which is not a valid token defined in <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-5.6.2>.\n\nIn addition to the above, based on <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113#section-8.3> and <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114#section-4.3.1>, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 requests **MUST** include exactly one value for the `:method`, `:scheme`, and `:path` pseudo-header fields, unless the request is a `CONNECT` request which may omit `:scheme` and `:path`.\n\nAllowing invalid characters in pseudo headers can result in sending an invalid request line when proxying from HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 client to HTTP/1 upstream service."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `:method` pseudo-header in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 requests, which allows for invalid characters and multiple values within the pseudo-header field. This can lead to issues when proxying to HTTP/1 upstream services.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"
      ],
      "Impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a bypass of security policies. Specifically, a non-compliant HTTP/1 service might allow the malformed request, potentially leading to unauthorized access or actions.",
      "Attack Vector": "Attackers can send specifically crafted HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 requests with an invalid method value.",
      "Required Capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 requests. No special privileges are required."
    },
    "Additional Information": {
      "Affected Components": "HTTP2/HTTP3",
        "Exploit Example": "Send an HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 request with invalid `:method` header such as `:method: GET /admin`.",
      "Detection": "Upstream service receives unexpected privileged requests from Envoy.",
          "Credits": "Martin van Kervel Smedshammer mvsmedsh@ifi.uio.no",
          "Severity": "Moderate (5.4 CVSS score)",
          "CVSS Vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"
