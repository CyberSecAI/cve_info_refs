- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability occurs when using the "satask downloadsoftware" command or the "Obtain the package directly" option in the GUI to update the system. During the download process, the IBMid credentials used for authentication to Fix Central may be exposed under certain circumstances.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive credentials during software download.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially gain access to the exposed IBMid credentials, which could then be used to access other resources or systems associated with those credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves using the affected software update mechanisms, either via the command-line interface (CLI) or the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be in a position to observe the network traffic or access the system during the download process to capture the exposed credentials.
