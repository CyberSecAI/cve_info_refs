* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"
* **Did you search for an IBM acquired or sold product ?** If so, follow the appropriate link below to find the content you need.

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

If using the "satask downloadsoftware" command or the "Obtain the package directly" option in the GUI to update the system on IBM SAN Volume Controller, IBM Storwize and IBM FlashSystem products which run IBM Spectrum Virtualize software, the IBMid credentials used to authenticate to Fix Central may be exposed under certain circumstances while the download is in progress. [CVE-2023-27870]

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2023-27870](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-27870)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Spectrum Virtualize | 8.5 |

Note that this applies to all IBM SAN Volume Controller, IBM Storwize and IBM FlashSystem products which run IBM Spectrum Virtualize software.

## Remediation/Fixes

IBM recommends that you fix this vulnerability by upgrading affected versions of IBM SAN Volume Controller, IBM Storwize V7000, IBM Storwize V5000 and V5100, IBM Storwize V5000E, IBM Spectrum Virtualize Software, IBM Spectrum Virtualize for Public Cloud, IBM FlashSystem V9000, IBM FlashSystem 9500, IBM FlashSystem 9100 Family, IBM FlashSystem 9200, IBM FlashSystem 7300, IBM FlashSystem 7200, IBM FlashSystem 5200 and IBM FlashSystem 5000 to the following code levels or higher:

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Until you have applied the fix, a temporary alternative is available:

* **Do not use the "Obtain the package directly" feature in the GUI (available in 8.5.4 and above) or the satask downloadsoftware command on the CLI.**
* Navigate to the Fix Central website in a separate browser window, download the update package and then upload it in the GUI using the "Provide the package manually" option in the Update System panel (or simply "Update System" prior to 8.5.4).

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
