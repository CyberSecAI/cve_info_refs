- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The module `tshirtecommerce` fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in two different locations, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `designer.php` controller file via the `product_id` GET parameter.
  - Improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `hookActionCartSave` and `updateCustomizationTable` functions via the `tshirtecommerce_design_cart_id` GET parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to:
  - Obtain admin access
  - Removal of data from the associated PrestaShop
  - Copy/paste of data from sensitive tables to the front end, potentially exposing tokens and unlocking admin ajax scripts
  - Modification of SMTP settings to hijack emails.
- **Attack vectors**: HTTP GET requests with manipulated `product_id` and `tshirtecommerce_design_cart_id` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges and can be anonymous. The attack vector is network-based.

The advisory provides more detailed information than the typical CVE description, including specific vulnerable code locations, a proof-of-concept URL, and recommended patches. It also suggests removing the vulnerable module entirely and additional hardening measures.
