Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when creating or editing post tags in the Typecho admin backend. Specifically, the input is directly injected into a `<li>` HTML tag without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **DOM-based XSS:** The vulnerability is a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. This means the malicious payload is not directly reflected in the server's response but is instead executed within the user's browser through client-side JavaScript.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided tag names before inserting them into the HTML structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page. This can allow them to:
    *   Steal session cookies, potentially hijacking user accounts.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Modify the content of the web page.
    *   Perform other actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Admin Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered within the admin interface of Typecho, specifically when creating or editing a post and adding a new tag.
*   **Malicious Tag Name:** The attacker needs to inject malicious JavaScript within a tag name input field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have access to the Typecho admin interface and the ability to create/edit posts. This typically means the attacker needs to have at least author-level privileges.
*   The attacker can inject malicious code by crafting a tag name containing JavaScript payloads (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Typecho versions up to and including 1.2.0.
*   The issue was reported by Srpopty and discovered using Corax.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in pull request #1716, which removes special characters to prevent XSS.
