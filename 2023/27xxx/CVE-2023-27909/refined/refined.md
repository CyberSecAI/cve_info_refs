**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- Code execution
- Information disclosure

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted FBX files: An attacker can create a specially crafted FBX file that, when processed by a vulnerable application, triggers the out-of-bounds write.
- Tricking a user into opening the malicious file: An attacker may trick a user into opening a malicious FBX file in an application using the vulnerable FBX SDK.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious FBX file.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to make the victim process the malicious FBX file using a vulnerable version of the FBX SDK.
