Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-27982:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345) in the Data Server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   The Data Server does not properly verify the authenticity of incoming data, allowing for manipulation of dashboard files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Manipulation of dashboard files in the IGSS project report directory.
*   Potential remote code execution when a victim opens a malicious dashboard file.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Sending specifically crafted messages to the Data Server TCP port.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Network access to the Data Server TCP port.
*   Ability to craft specific messages.
*   User interaction is required (victim opening the malicious dashboard file)

**Summary**
CVE-2023-27982 details a vulnerability in the IGSS Data Server where a lack of proper data authentication allows an attacker to manipulate dashboard files by sending crafted messages to the server's TCP port. This could lead to remote code execution if a user opens a modified, malicious dashboard file.
