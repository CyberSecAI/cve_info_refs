■Overview

 CX-Drive, a support tool for inverters/servos, was found to contain a heap-based buffer

overflow  vulnerability  (CWE-122).    A  local  attacker  can  exploit  this  issue  to  disclose

information and execute arbitrary code on an affected CX-Drive installation.

Exploitation  of  this  vulnerability  requires  user  interaction,  which  is  a  requirement  that  a

user open a malicious SDD file.

The affected products, versions, mitigations and workarounds are listed below. By

implementing mitigations and workarounds recommended by the Company, the risk of

exploitation of this vulnerability can be minimized.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H Base value 7.8

■Mitigations and Workarounds

 In order to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, we recommend that you

take the following mitigations and workarounds measures.

1.  Antivirus Protection

・ Installation and maintenance of the latest commercial-quality anti-virus software on

PCs connected to the control system

No. OMSR-2023-004_en ( 2 / 2 )

・ Do not execute suspicious project files

2.

Prevention of unauthorized access

• Minimize network connectivity of control systems and equipment and prohibit access

from untrusted devices

・ Isolation from the IT network by introducing firewalls (blocking unused communication

ports, restricting communication hosts)

・ If remote access to control systems and equipment is required, use a virtual private

network (VPN)

・ Adopt strong passwords and change them frequently

・ Introduction of physical controls that allow only authorized persons to access control

systems and equipment.

• Pre-virus scanning when using external storage devices such as USB sticks in control

systems and devices

・ Introduction of multi-factor authentication for remote access to control systems and

equipment

3.

Securing data input and output

・ Validation of backup and range checks in preparation for unintentional modification of

input/output data to control systems and devices

4.  Recover lost data

・Regular backup and maintenance of configuration data as a measure against data

loss

5.  Adoption of new software tools and controllers

・Automation software Sysmac Studio

・Controller NJ/NX/NY Series
