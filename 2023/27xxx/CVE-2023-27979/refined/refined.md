- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Data Server has a vulnerability where it does not properly verify the authenticity of data, allowing an attacker to send crafted messages to the Data Server's TCP port.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to rename files in the IGSS project report directory. This can lead to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker sends specific crafted messages to the Data Server's TCP port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the Data Server TCP port to send crafted messages. No user interaction is required.
