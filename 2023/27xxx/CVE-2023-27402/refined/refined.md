- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability while parsing specially crafted SPP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered by parsing specially crafted SPP files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious SPP file using the affected application. The attacker requires local access to the system to execute code.
