A vulnerability has been identified in Tecnomatix Plant Simulation (All versions < V2201.0006). The affected applications contain an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted SPP files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-20334)
