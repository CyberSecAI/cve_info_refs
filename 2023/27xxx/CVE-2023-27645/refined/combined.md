June 4, 2019I have paid for this app a while ago, looked great, was exactly what you could what from a player, then an update came and it was messed up completely. Sometimes wonder why, "when it's not broke why try to fix it". After the update, the music folders were mixed up, half my music I couldn't find & albums were showing only some of the songs. Now I have reverted back to the basic Samsung player, find the music no hassle with less of the features Poweramp had, but does the trick.26 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoPoweramp Software Design (Max MP)June 4, 2019What exactly do you dislike in the new UI?
v2 is archaic, comparing to v3.

January 10, 2025For the most part, this app works. The single big problem is that when you transfer or copy your music to your device, the app does NOT capture all track data or removes it. An example: 100% of the Elton John and Dire Straits tracks have had the artists' data removed requiring each individual track data being updated. I have the paid version of the app.4 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUBBDk3aGPYtoRNK4NVUGhJiyZPv_D5TFWbSdoQvcWhRYQKPjKM=s32-rw)SnappleTM*more\_vert*

January 10, 2025Every time I try and use poweramp on my Sony Xperia 1 iii, my entire phone glitches out. It plays normally for a while, but it seem that when I open the notification shade it locks the screen, then the text on the lock screen glitches out, then the screen goes black and I am locked out of my phone while music is playing. The phone is unresponsive until I force a restart. A couple times I have also gotten a warning that android is unable to load. I love the app, but it makes my phone unusable.7 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews
