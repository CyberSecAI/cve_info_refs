- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `tshirtecommerce` module for PrestaShop is vulnerable to path traversal due to insufficient input sanitization in the `/tshirtecommerce/fonts.php` endpoint (using GET parameter `type`) and the `tshirtecommerce/ajax.php?type=svg` endpoint (using POST parameter `file_name`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22)
    - Lack of input validation and sanitization for the `type` and `file_name` parameters.
    - The module fails to properly restrict access to files, allowing access to arbitrary files on the server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read the content of arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive information such as database credentials, configuration files, and private keys.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - By manipulating the GET parameter `type` in the `/tshirtecommerce/fonts.php` endpoint.
    - By manipulating the POST parameter `file_name` in the `/tshirtecommerce/ajax.php?type=svg` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected PrestaShop instance.
    - No authentication is required (privilege required: none).
