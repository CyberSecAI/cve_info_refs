Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the usage of `file_get_contents` within the `Intervention\Image\AbstractDecoder.php`'s `initFromUrl` method, which is invoked by the `Image::make()` function. This function processes the provided data as a URL which leads to arbitrary file reads through the `file://` protocol. Combined with a deserialization vulnerability present in the Laravel framework, it is possible to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by crafting a malicious PHAR archive and triggering its deserialization through the file read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure File Handling:** The `Image::make()` function, when processing URLs, uses `file_get_contents` without proper sanitization or validation of the input URL. This allows for arbitrary file reads.
*   **PHAR Deserialization:** The Laravel framework has a known deserialization vulnerability that can be triggered via PHAR archives.
*   **Image Upload Bypass:** The image upload functionality is vulnerable to bypass, allowing attackers to upload a malicious phar archive masquerading as an image.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the LightCMS application, leading to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Image Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted PHAR archive, disguised as a GIF file, via the CMS's image upload feature.
2.  **Remote File Inclusion (via `file://`):** The attacker crafts a text file hosted on a server, containing the path to the uploaded phar file (e.g., `phar://./upload/image/202102/AciwTtmKQ7IQN4gdeoiZ6ve4A0LSK48SGJGk38df.gif`). Then, the attacker uses the CMS's remote image download feature with the URL pointing to this text file.
3.  **PHAR Deserialization Trigger:**  The `Image::make()` function, when processing the URL in the text file, triggers a `file_get_contents` operation. This operation reads the PHAR archive which, in turn, triggers the deserialization vulnerability in Laravel, leading to RCE.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Ability to access the LightCMS application's backend, particularly the image upload and remote image download functionality.
*   Knowledge of the Laravel framework's deserialization vulnerability and how to craft a malicious PHAR archive.
*   Ability to host a malicious text file containing the path to the phar archive.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in LightCMS version v1.3.7.
*   The initial vulnerability was a simple arbitrary file read, that was patched. However, the patch introduced a different vulnerability by using a file read function that can trigger phar deserialization.
*   The provided exploit demonstrates the steps to create the phar archive and trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable code is within the `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/NEditorController.php` file, specifically using `Intervention\Image\Facades\Image`.
* The issue was reported and fixed by the maintainers of LightCMS.
*   The phar deserialization vulnerability uses a specific POP chain involving `Illuminate\Broadcasting\PendingBroadcast` and `Illuminate\Bus\Dispatcher` classes, and the `system` function is used as a gadget in the chain.
