  "CVE-2023-27852": {
    "description": "NETGEAR Nighthawk WiFi6 Router prior to V1.0.10.94 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in various CGI mechanisms that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.",
     "root_cause": "During the parsing of requests containing json input to any of the primary CGIs, a buffer overflow can be triggered that could result in code execution. Due to other protections enabled on the device such as ASLR, however, this flaw must be combined with other flaws for an exploit to be reliably crafted.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution",
    "attack_vector": "By providing valid json in request bodies with a content length greater than 4097, an overflow will occur leading to a segmentation fault and crashing the http service.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The vulnerable CGIs are:  `rex_cgi` (requires authentication),  `reset_pwd.cgi`, `tm_block.cgi` (can be triggered without authentication)."
