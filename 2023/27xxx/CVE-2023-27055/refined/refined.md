- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient filtering and validation of browser supplied user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal, Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can disclose sensitive files stored on the system. The provided PoC accesses the HOSTS file but it can be modified to access other sensitive files like public and private keys of the web application server created by the software.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted GET request to the web based application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the web application running on the localhost, which is created by the PTZApp2 software.

This content provides more detail than the official CVE description by describing the specific vulnerability type (directory traversal leading to LFI), the impact (sensitive file disclosure), and the method of exploitation (crafted HTTP GET request).
