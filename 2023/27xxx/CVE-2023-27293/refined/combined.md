# Multiple Vulnerabilities in OpenCATS 0.9.6

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

### Open Redirect

[AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:P/RL:X/RC:C&version=3.1) 7.3/6.9

CWE: 601

OpenCATS is vulnerable to a template injection vulnerability which is caused by improper validation of user-supplied GET parameters.

The request/response shown below is an example of what the victim would be served. We can see that the user is directed away from their intended site to a potentially malicious one ‘<https://tenable.com/>’.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GOg28KdNl4vhw-cvgHAc-R1yxUBY-rFaz1ysaFE2VyUaRx66C7pw691ASWWEJrWigLobIP_vxt5_XEHywQZ8vBY_mP0Qvr2nSi9CHXhW1fPQVp2Mv-szDp6W57IzIDvW9KXg0kPZYFboPWvsmloQkDURiPF9u3D5nYEl3LLQu_hVn-JaJhEm5RZSC2OVA)

This vulnerability is found in SettingsUI.php where the ‘url’ GET parameter is passed as the value to the HTML frame source in the template.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/252uBPUYsqWbWpdDiY_im6QWLgBiZArIe_d5uemi7tRIeMpf8-cTsZ-5YyLlM5PmoeUFEmD4TPuRwBnbiKH8H5nF-4iN5P_fMG5Yp2TbKFkRw6qGQ68IkzaIEvQdYILFbpo_PqtYSwdMYumevKwoafVftyAzZM7y6hv4nBumEgiD3ImRDYFUAIy-aiE27w)

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/N735oBSsfDOoTzRmb8M0pIu5xeneLMcP_usvKTvIlcLs_JWlOlNWux9s_QhlhuTUGiYHGhHx6G1PCXdTltWJVnwsT2BaT7RCYPcl3EvHQ3WaEXwD8zR9NeY-Jvf1IszikHtb8viqYvo5XSvxcSTpRmNlin0vojrqOjU4vck0-MmpVyvMokH0tvEaLcphqQ)

Since this value is not sanitized we can also pass Javascript that will be executed when the page renders.

| GET /index.php?m=settings&a=previewPage&url=[https://tenable.com](https://tenable.com/) HTTP/2 Host: <your address> Cookie: CATS=<your CATS session token here> |
| --- |

You will then see that you are redirected to the [tenable.com](http://tenable.com/) domain.

### Unauthenticated Stored XSS

[AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L/E:P/RL:U/RC:C&version=3.1) 8.3/7.9

CWE:79

It was noted during testing that the target is vulnerable to stored cross site scripting due to insufficient sanitization of questionnaire answers in the candidate application form.

An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this issue by submitting malicious Javascript as the answer to a questionnaire which would then be executed when an authenticated user reviews the candidate's submission. This could be used to steal other users’ cookies and force users to make actions without their knowledge.

#### Proof of concept

To reproduce this issue, send the below request to the OpenCATS target. Note: you will need to change the target IP address in the host header to that of your own target.

CWE: 79

It was noted during testing that the target is vulnerable to stored cross site scripting due to insufficient sanitization of the description when creating a calendar event.

An authenticated attacker with access to a restricted account could exploit this issue by submitting malicious Javascript as the description for a calendar event, which would then be executed in other users' browsers if they browse to that event. This could result in stealing session tokens from users with higher permission levels or forcing users to make actions without their knowledge.

==========================

### Proof of concept

To reproduce this issue, send the below request to the OpenCATS target. Note: you will need to add your own CATS session token and change the target IP address in the host header to that of your own target.

### Cross-site request forgery

[AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L/E:P/RL:U/RC:C&version=3.1)

CWE: 352

There is no CSRF protection for this application; we can see in the POST request below that there is no CSRF token being used.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1Fw8rn8uaSb2fv9JvUg9mt_hY1M8hi1QVh4lm1AmsnK6unJF6JZxVnMXMv9jsAazzmI0PuDbyMXBg9xzx9jO9aiqxQl_ZIO3lZih3KOedg9nGSZyenxaRpoLnkjau_ZZJrb4jWEbXKZGKP8d3LuGKH0a7qQxTn9gfflsSIUoKcXybqyRELhD8Uf2iSf8DQ)

An attacker could exploit this issue by creating a dummy page that would execute Javascript in an authenticated user's session if they were tricked into using the malicious dummy page. However, some actions in this application are made with GET parameters which means an attacker would only need to trick an authenticated user into browsing to a specific URL.

#### Proof of concept

If an authenticated user browses to the below URL they will send an email to a specified address. Note that the fromAddress parameter has to use the domain of the OpenCATS installation, but the username can be anything you like.

  ###### critical

  Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring tool. A critical vulnerability was discovered in the SAML SSO implementation of Sentry. It was reported to us via our private bug bounty program. The vulnerability allows an attacker to take over any user account by using a malicious SAML Identity Provider and another organization on the same Sentry instance. The victim email address must be known in order to exploit this vulnerability. The Sentry SaaS fix was deployed on Jan 14, 2025. For self hosted users; if only a single organization is allowed `(SENTRY\_SINGLE\_ORGANIZATION = True)`, then no action is needed. Otherwise, users should upgrade to version 25.1.0 or higher. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

* ##### [CVE-2025-23040](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-23040)

  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.

This software package has an issue that allows for an authentication bypass in some configurations. An attacker would require the ability to access the system as an unprivileged user. Depending on the configuration, the attacker may also need to know the user's password.
