The provided content describes vulnerabilities related to CVE-2023-27569 and CVE-2023-27570, both affecting the "Tracking et Conversions (eo_tags)" module for PrestaShop. This analysis focuses on CVE-2023-27570, although they are closely related.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `saveGanalyticsCookie()` and `gaParseCookie()` functions when handling the `_ga` cookie, as well as in the `trackReferrer()` function when handling `User-Agent` and `Referer` headers. The code does not properly sanitize or escape user-controlled data before using it in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code through crafted HTTP requests via the `_ga` cookie, User-Agent, or Referer headers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information in the database. This includes technical and personal data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could potentially elevate their privileges by modifying data or executing arbitrary SQL commands. This could lead to gaining admin access.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Forgery:** Attackers forge HTTP requests with compromised `_ga` cookies or crafted User-Agent/Referer headers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be performed by an anonymous user.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Module:** While the module name is hidden in conventional logs, attackers need to be aware of the vulnerable module.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in the `eo_tags` module, specifically in versions between 1.2.0 and 1.4.18. It was fixed in version 1.4.19.
- The vulnerability within `trackReferrer()` existed up to version 1.2.19, after which it was partially mitigated by moving the vulnerable code to `EoTagsStats.php` (`EoTagsStats::setNewGuest()`), requiring user interaction and privileges.
- The exploit using cookies and the referer is difficult to trace in standard frontend logs as it only shows GET/POST requests.
- The fix involves using `pSQL()` function to sanitize the input parameters before using them in SQL queries.
