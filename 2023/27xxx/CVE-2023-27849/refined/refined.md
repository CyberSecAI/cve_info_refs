```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the use of the `child_process.exec` function without input sanitization. User-controlled input passed to the 'command' option is directly used in the exec call.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary command injection (CWE-77)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the operating system where the vulnerable package is being used.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing malicious input to the 'command' option of the `rails-routes-to-json` constructor.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control the input that is passed to the 'command' option of the `rails-routes-to-json` constructor, usually through another package that depends on it. "
