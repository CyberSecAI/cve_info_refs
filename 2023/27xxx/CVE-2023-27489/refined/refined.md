Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from Kiwi TCMS accepting SVG files uploaded by users. These SVG files could contain embedded JavaScript code that would execute if the SVG is viewed directly (not rendered within an HTML page).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript within a user-uploaded SVG file is stored on the server. When the SVG file is accessed directly, the malicious script is executed in the user's browser.
- **Lack of Proper Content Security Policy (CSP):** The application did not have a proper Content Security Policy in place to prevent execution of the JavaScript within the SVG files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when an SVG file is viewed directly. This could lead to:
    - Data theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web application
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the upload of a malicious SVG file via the web interface of Kiwi TCMS.
- The user would need to access the raw uploaded SVG file for the exploit to trigger.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the system (as they would need to be able to upload SVG files).
- The attacker must be able to upload files (i.e., have the necessary privileges).
- The attacker does not require any special access privileges other than a valid user account with file upload capabilities.
- The attacker does not require any specific position in the network, being a network attack vector.

**Additional Details:**

- **Patch:** The vulnerability is addressed by implementing a Content-Security-Policy (CSP) HTTP header in the server configuration, which blocks inline JavaScript in browsers, preventing the malicious script from executing.
- **CVSS Score**: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L is a high score, with high confidentiality and integrity impact and a low availability impact.
- The fix was introduced in version 12.1 of Kiwi TCMS.
- The vulnerability was independently disclosed by Antonio Spataro and @1d8.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability, its cause, impact, and the necessary steps to mitigate it.
