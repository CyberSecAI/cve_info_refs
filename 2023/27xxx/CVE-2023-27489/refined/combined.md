# Stored XSS via SVG file upload

High

[atodorov](/atodorov)
published
GHSA-2wcr-87wf-cf9j
Mar 29, 2023

## Package

Kiwi TCMS

## Affected versions

<=12.0

## Patched versions

12.1

## Description

### Impact

Kiwi TCMS accepts SVG files uploaded by users which could potentially contain JavaScript code. If SVG images are viewed directly, i.e. not rendered in an HTML page, this JavaScript code could execute.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been fixed by configuring Kiwi TCMS to serve with the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header which blocks inline JavaScript in all modern browsers.

### Workarounds

Configure Content-Security-Policy header, see [commit 6617cee0](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/6617cee0fb70cc394b7be6bbc86ef84e6e9de077).

### References

You can visit <https://digi.ninja/blog/svg_xss.php> for more technical details.

Independently disclosed by [Antonio Spataro](https://huntr.dev/bounties/bf99001b-a0a2-4f7d-98cd-983bc7f14a69/) and [@1d8](https://huntr.dev/bounties/f8c73bcc-02f3-4c65-a92b-1caa4d67c2fd/).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

### CVE ID
