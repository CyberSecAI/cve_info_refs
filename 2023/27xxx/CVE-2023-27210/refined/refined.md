The provided content is a description of an online pizza ordering system project built using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and MySQL. It includes details about the system's features, technologies used, and how to run it, along with screenshots of the user interface and admin panel. It also includes a default admin username and password, which is a very bad security practice.

Based on the content provided, there is no direct vulnerability information related to a specific CVE. However, the following potential weaknesses can be inferred:

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Default Credentials:** The system uses default username and password for the admin account ("admin", "admin123"). This is a severe security risk, as anyone who knows this default information can access the admin panel.
*   **Lack of Security Practices:** The description highlights the lack of security practices within the code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain full access to the admin panel using the default credentials or other vulnerabilities, which could allow:
    *   Data manipulation
    *   Changing orders
    *   Changing product prices
    *   Steal user's personal information.
    *   Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access:** Using the provided default admin credentials.
*   **Application Vulnerabilities:** Other vulnerabilities in the PHP code (which are not specified in this content), such as SQL injection, or cross-site scripting could also be used as attack vectors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of web application exploitation.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to access the application through the network.

**Note:** The main issue with the provided content is the default admin credentials which allow for trivial unauthorized access. Other potential vulnerabilities may exist within the code, but are not mentioned in the text.
