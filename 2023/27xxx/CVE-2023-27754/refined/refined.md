The provided content is related to CVE-2023-27754.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Incorrect use of the `memcpy()` function within the `VoxReader::readChunk` function in `VoxReader.cpp`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, an attacker can control `chunkContentSize` and cause a stack overflow via `memcpy(&chunkContent, bytes + 12, chunkContentSize)`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to a stack overflow. The program aborts as a result of a segmentation fault.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a crafted .vox file is processed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted .vox file to the vulnerable application (`vox2obj`).
- The attacker does not need to be local, they can supply the malicious file through a variety of channels that would result in `vox2obj` attempting to process the file.
