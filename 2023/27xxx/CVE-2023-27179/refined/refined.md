Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control and insufficient input validation in the `imgdownload.php` script of the GDidees CMS. Specifically, the `filename` GET parameter is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing arbitrary file downloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Download:** The primary vulnerability is an unrestricted file download, where an attacker can specify a file path using the `filename` parameter, leading to the download of any accessible file on the server.
*  **Incorrect Access Control**: The `imgdownload.php` script is located in the administrative directory but does not implement any admin session control, making it accessible to any visitor.
*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows path traversal, which means an attacker can navigate outside of the intended directories by using sequences such as `../` in the `filename` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can download sensitive files, such as configuration files (potentially containing database credentials) or system files such as `/etc/passwd`. This can expose sensitive information, potentially leading to a full compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a web browser or using tools such as curl.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack involves crafting a specific HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `imgdownload.php` file, including the `filename` parameter with a path to the desired file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need any specific credentials or to be logged in, as the vulnerability is accessible to any visitor. The only requirement is the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server.

**Technical Details**

*   Vulnerable parameter: `filename` within `imgdownload.php`.
*   Vulnerable URL: `http://{gdidees_root}/_admin/imgdownload.php?filename=../../../../../etc/passwd`
*   Affected versions: GDidees CMS v3.9.1 and lower.
*   The server will download the file as a `.png` if the request comes from a browser, or output the file content directly if using curl.

**Additional Notes:**

* The `secureflag.com` content provides a generic explanation of unrestricted file download vulnerabilities and prevention strategies. It also references OWASP guidelines for testing this type of vulnerability.
* The `gdidees.eu` page details the updates in the latest versions of GDidees CMS and provides download links. It shows that versions up to 4.0.4 are available, with the identified vulnerability affecting versions up to and including 3.9.1.
