The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `ehuacui-bbs` project.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not sanitize user-supplied data when displaying usernames on the frontend. Specifically, the application stores the username as is in the database.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability. User-supplied data is not sanitized upon retrieval.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the username field, which will be executed in the browsers of other users when the username is displayed. This can lead to information disclosure, session hijacking, and other malicious actions. The provided example demonstrates cookie exfiltration by using `alert(document.cookie)`.

- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can register a new account with a malicious JavaScript payload as the username.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to register a user account to trigger the vulnerability. No special privileges or positions are required.
