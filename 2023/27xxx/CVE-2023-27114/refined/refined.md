Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2023-27114.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A null pointer dereference occurs in the `wasm_dis` function within the `radare2` project's WebAssembly (Wasm) disassembler. This happens when the `opdef->txt` field is NULL and passed to `strdup`

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference in `strdup` function within `wasm_dis` when `opdef->txt` is NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault leading to a crash of the radare2 application.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted WASM file to radare2 that causes the `opdef->txt` to be NULL during disassembly.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious WASM file to be processed by `radare2`, or have the user open a malicious WASM file using `radare2`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs specifically at line 1112 in `libr/arch/p/wasm/wasm.c`.
- The issue is triggered when using the `pd` command to disassemble the WASM file in `radare2`.
- The commit `a15067a8eaa836bcc24b0882712c14d1baa66509` was created to address the issue, and the fix involves adding a check to make sure that the `opdef->txt` isn't NULL before passing to `strdup`.
