| Tested version: [b80b09d](https://github.com/totaljs/openplatform/commit/b80b09d1e12ada675d0cbb6d9c4af9e5a8097751) (latest)  Steps to reproduce the vulnerability:   * Login in the application. * Click on setup. * Click on settings. * Set `"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>` as platform name and save. * Logout and XSS will fire.

| Hello [edoardottt], Thank you for your comment. The problem can be solved applying String.removeTags(); to remove al html tags from name in both forms that you comment before submit them.  example: form.name = form.name.removeTags();  Sure there are some of others solutions into Total.js. |

| don't rely on these naive solutions, there are specific libraries to sanitize input. you can use symbols in fields but simply they will be rendered as pure text and not html. |

| Hi [@edoardottt](https://github.com/edoardottt). Thank you for the report. I can't reproduce this issue because I think that it's related to the previous issue with the user name. I found a bug in a helper (on FE) for generating name initials. |

| [@petersirka](https://github.com/petersirka) exactly, if in the same instance you have injected the payload in user name this issue is not exploitable (because it's impossible to reach the settings). I had to deploy a new instance from scratch. |
