{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient file extension validation and inadequate restrictions on file execution in the 'trash' directory after deleting a file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Blacklisting of file extensions instead of whitelisting.",
      "Lack of restrictions on executable files within the trash directory.",
      "Inconsistent file handling across different directories."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary remote code execution (RCE) on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Uploading a webshell with a non-blacklisted extension (e.g., .inc) via the admin file upload functionality.",
      "Deleting the uploaded webshell to move it to the trash directory.",
        "Executing the webshell from the trash directory where php code is not disabled."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the file upload functionality. No other special capabilities/position needed."
  }
