- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient memory handling.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper memory handling allows for arbitrary code execution outside of the app's sandbox or with elevated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code outside of a sandboxed app or with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The document doesn't provide specific attack vectors, but it indicates this is a local issue affecting applications.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a sandboxed app to take advantage of this vulnerability.
