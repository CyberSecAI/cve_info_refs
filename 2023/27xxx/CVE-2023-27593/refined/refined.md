  "CVE-2023-27593": {
    "related": true,
    "info": "The Cilium agent container had a vulnerability where it could access the host via a `hostPath` mount. Specifically, the agent pod mounted `/opt/cni/bin` from the host. An attacker with access to the Cilium agent pod could write to this directory, replacing the CNI binary with a malicious one. Upon creation of a new pod on the node, the attacker could gain access to the underlying node.",
    "root_cause": "The Cilium agent pod used a `hostPath` mount for `/opt/cni/bin`, allowing write access to the host filesystem from within the container.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control through hostPath mount"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could gain control of the underlying node by replacing the CNI binary, leading to full system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Compromise a cilium-agent pod",
       "Write to the host's `/opt/cni/bin` directory"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Requires access to a Cilium agent pod to write to `/opt/cni/bin`.",
    "patches": [
      "Cilium versions 1.11.15, 1.12.8, and 1.13.1 were released to address this vulnerability by changing the installation of the CNI plugin binary. The CNI binaries are now installed via an initContainer instead of relying on a hostPath mount."
    ],
    "workarounds": "Use Kubernetes RBAC to deny users and service accounts `exec` access to Cilium agent pods."
