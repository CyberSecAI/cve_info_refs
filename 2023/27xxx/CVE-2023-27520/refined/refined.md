- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web interface of SEIKO EPSON printers/network interface (Web Config) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The web interface does not sufficiently validate the source of the requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing unintended operations on the printer/network interface by viewing a malicious page.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious web page or email containing a forged request that, when visited by a logged-in user, triggers actions on the Web Config interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a user who is already logged into the Web Config interface to visit the malicious page. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the Web Config.
