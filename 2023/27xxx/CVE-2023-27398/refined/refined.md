- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application contains an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer while parsing specially crafted SPP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious SPP file using the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious SPP file and convince the user to open it with the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system.
