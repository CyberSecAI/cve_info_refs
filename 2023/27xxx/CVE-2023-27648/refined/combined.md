September 11, 2023Everything works as it should. However, one major issue for me was the gifs search. There is no general search for gifs, only categories. It pulls only from giphy, samsung keyboard was easy. Within this app, I couldn't even search for 'missing you' to my loved one. I'm an emotional person & I can't send any expressions with cute sweet gifs anymore due to this. I'd have to download them from tenor to send them.. It led to me uninstalling the app. FIX IT.32 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo2024 Themes & KeyboardsSeptember 12, 2023Hi there and thank you for taking the time to send us your feedback.

December 5, 2021This app is really cool~ there are so many different keyboard themes that are free to download and you can purchase different fonts, too, for coins. The app starts you off with enough coins to customize the keyboard with swagger of your choosing, and you can always get more coins by watching a 30 second video. The ads aren't so bad, either.309 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJK6Gaeu5eCE9lzdF2tY-QZtzsq7D4Km0ZU6_lyRnWIniCGCA=s32-rw-mo)Abruey Ezequiel Naranjo*more\_vert*

August 24, 2020It is a great app it is a little hard to get the hand of it at first. But the app is really awsome . So I would recomened it but you can make your own keyboard with color and pic. But if you want other ones you have to get the apps but I love this app so so much. And you can also earn coins when you watch a add but you get 800 for each add and thats awsome. It does not have any adds at all but if you do want 800 coins you have to watch a add but only one. I love this app so so much.üòÅüòÅüòçüòçüòò393 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews
