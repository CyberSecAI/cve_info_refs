Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the MiroTalk P2P web application, specifically within the chat and file sharing functionalities. This lack of sanitization allows malicious JavaScript code to be injected and executed within the browsers of other meeting participants, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS attacks, where malicious payloads are stored and then reflected to other users. This occurs in multiple areas:
    *   **User Names:** A participant can change their name to include malicious JavaScript code. This name is then displayed to all other participants, causing the script to execute in their browsers.
    *   **File Names:** When a user uploads a file, the filename is not sanitized. A malicious filename can inject XSS payloads that are executed when the filename is displayed in the chat or upload popup.
    *   **Websocket data**: The client-side sanitization can be bypassed by intercepting and modifying the websocket requests sent from the client.
    *   **Private messages**: The private message feature is vulnerable because the peer_name is reflected without sanitization.
    *   **Room names**: The room name was not properly sanitized, which could break the loading screen.

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application lacks sufficient input validation and output sanitization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into various parts of the interface.
*   **Client-Side Validation Bypass:** Initial attempts to fix the XSS vulnerability focused on client-side validation which was easily bypassed by intercepting and modifying websocket requests, emphasizing the need for server-side sanitization.
*   **HTML Injection:** Although the XSS vulnerability was fixed with `js-xss` library, HTML injection was still possible although the impact was considered low.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could have serious consequences:

*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially hijack user sessions, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Website Defacement:** Malicious scripts can deface the web interface, altering its appearance or functionality.
*   **Malware Injection:** Attackers could insert malicious content, including malware, into the application's response, potentially infecting user machines.
*   **Redirecting to Malicious Pages:** Users could be redirected to attacker-controlled websites for phishing or malware distribution.
*   **Browser Hijacking:** Malicious scripts could potentially hijack a user's browser, allowing the attacker to control the browser's behavior.
*   **Impersonification**: An attacker could fake the `peer_name` when sharing videos or raising their hand. This allows an attacker to impersonate another participant and potentially share malicious or inappropriate content.
*   **Denial of service**: A user could brick the loading screen by choosing a room name such as `</h1>` or `</>`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct User Input:** Attackers can inject malicious code by modifying their display name, creating malicious filenames, or using the room creation feature.
*   **WebSockets:** Attackers can intercept and modify WebSocket requests to inject malicious payloads bypassing the client-side sanitization.
*   **Private Messages:** Attackers can exploit the private messaging functionality by setting a malicious username, leading to XSS when other users attempt to send them private messages.
*   **Shared content:** Attackers can modify the `peer_name` when sharing videos or raising their hands via websockets

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Meeting Participant:** Attackers need to be a participant in a MiroTalk meeting to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Interception:** To bypass the client-side validation, the attacker would need the capability to intercept and modify WebSocket requests.

The provided content demonstrates a detailed discussion and iterative process of fixing the XSS vulnerability. The initial fix was only client-side which was bypassed by manipulating websocket requests. Ultimately, the vulnerability was addressed by implementing server-side sanitization using the `js-xss` library, and additional sanitization to various parts of the app, including the room name, private messages and name changes.
