          "Incorrect Access Control",
          "Information Leakage via debug interface"

          "Element debugging interface leakage"

        "impact": "The debugging interface leakage can lead to JS code execution (XSS), potentially enabling information leakage, network request manipulation, element code inspection, and unauthorized user data changes.",
        "attackVectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user enters an incorrect invitation code and repeatedly clicks the redeem button after getting a 'too many attempts' error. This action causes a debug console to appear within the app.",
        "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs access to the PikPak application and the ability to interact with the interface and repeatedly click the redeem button."
