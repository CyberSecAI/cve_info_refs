SSA-847261: Multiple SPP File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Tecnomatix
Plant Simulation

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2023-02-14
2023-03-14
V1.1

SUMMARY

Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation has released an update, 2201 Update 6, that ﬁxes multiple
vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads SPP ﬁles. If a user is tricked to open a
malicious ﬁle using the affected application, this could lead to a crash, and potentially also to arbitrary
code execution on the target host system.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest version and to avoid opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown
sources.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

Tecnomatix Plant Simulation:
All versions < V2201.0006

Update to V2201.0006 or later version
https://support.sw.siemens.com/
See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not open untrusted SPP ﬁles from unknown sources

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Tecnomatix Plant Simulation allows you to model, simulate, explore and optimize logistics systems and
their processes. These models enable analysis of material ﬂow, resource utilization and logistics for all
levels of manufacturing planning from global production facilities to local plants and speciﬁc lines, well in
advance of production execution.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
