# FPE in TFLite in conv kernel

Moderate

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-5w96-866f-6rm8
Mar 24, 2023

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.12.0

## Patched versions

2.12.0, 2.11.1

## Description

### Impact

Constructing a tflite model with a paramater `filter_input_channel` of less than 1 gives a FPE.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [34f8368c535253f5c9cb3a303297743b62442aaa](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/34f8368c535253f5c9cb3a303297743b62442aaa).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.11.1.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability was reported by Wang Xuan of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-27579

### Weaknesses
