Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the CGI program of certain Zyxel 4G LTE and 5G NR outdoor routers.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The core issue is a buffer overflow, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries. This specific instance is located within the CGI program of the affected routers.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions. This means the device would become unavailable or unstable, disrupting its normal functionality.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and able to send HTTP requests to the device. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
