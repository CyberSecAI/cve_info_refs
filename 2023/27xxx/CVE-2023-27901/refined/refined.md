The provided content contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2023-27901.

**CVE-2023-27901**

*   **Root Cause:** This CVE is related to a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Apache Commons FileUpload library, which is used by Jenkins to process file uploads.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability stems from the library's handling of multipart/form-data requests with a large number of parts. Specifically, the library didn't properly limit the number of request parts, which could lead to excessive resource consumption.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending crafted requests with a large number of parts to HTTP endpoints processing file uploads.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker sends crafted HTTP requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable Jenkins instance. They must also have at least low-level permissions.

**Additional Details:**
* Jenkins versions 2.393 and earlier, LTS 2.375.3 and earlier are affected.
* Jenkins 2.394, LTS 2.375.4, and LTS 2.387.1 limit the number of request parts to be processed.
* The vulnerability affects both `StaplerRequest#getFile` and `MultipartFormDataParser` in Jenkins.
* While an update to the Apache Commons FileUpload library was previously made, Jenkins-specific changes are necessary for protection.
* The document provides details on system properties (`hudson.util.MultipartFormDataParser.FILEUPLOAD_MAX_FILES` and `org.kohsuke.stapler.RequestImpl.FILEUPLOAD_MAX_FILES`) to adjust the limit on request parts or disable it, and also to limit the size of uploaded files.
