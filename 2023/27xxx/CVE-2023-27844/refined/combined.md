[Friends-Of-Presta Security Advisories](/)

[Cybersecurity Glossary](/glossary/)[About](/about/)

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: DO NOT REPORT VULNERABILITIES SOLELY TO THE AUTHOR OR MARKETPLACE.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities directly to us. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of the PrestaShop ecosystem. Unfortunately, many module developers may not always recognize or acknowledge the vulnerabilities in their code, whether due to lack of awareness, or inability to properly evaluate the associated risk, or other reasons.

Given the rise in professional cybercrime networks actively seeking out these vulnerabilities, it's crucial that any potential threats are promptly addressed and the community is informed. The most effective method to do this is by publishing a CVE, like the one provided below.

Should you discover any vulnerabilities, **please report them to us at: report[@]security-presta.org** or visit [https://security-presta.org](https://security-presta.org/) for more information.

Every vulnerability report helps make the community more secure, and we are profoundly grateful for any information shared with us.

# [CVE-2023-27844] Improper neutralization of SQL parameter in leurlrewrite for PrestaShop

Apr 13, 2023
• #modules • critical (9.8) •
202-ecommerce.com,
TouchWeb.fr,
Friends-Of-Presta.org

In the module “LitExtension Url Plugin” (leurlrewrite) for PrestaShop, an attacker can perform SQL injection up to 1.0. Even though the module has been patched in version 1.0, the version number was not incremented at the time. We consider the issue resolved in versions after 1.0.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-27844](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-27844)
* **Published at**: 2023-04-13
* **Advisory source**: Friends-Of-Presta.org
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: leurlrewrite
* **Impacted release**: < 1.0
* **Product author**: LitExtension
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

A sensitive SQL call the overrided class `Dispatcher::getController()` can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a blind SQL injection through by calling a not found page.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Technical and personal data leaks
* Obtain admin access
* Remove all data of the linked PrestaShop
* Display sensitives tables to front-office to unlock potential admin’s ajax scripts of modules protected by token on the ecosystem

## Patch

*IMPORTANT*: apply the patch and reset the module or update the override/classes/Dispatcher.php of the PrestaShop manually.

```
## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade the module beyond 1.0.4.
* To help improve the security of your PrestaShop installation, we recommend upgrading to the latest version. One of the benefits of upgrading is that it will disable the use of multiquery executions (separated by semicolons). However, please be aware that this **will not protect** your shop against SQL injection attacks that use the UNION clause to steal data. Additionally, it’s important to note that PrestaShop includes a function called pSQL, which includes a strip\_tags function. This helps protect your shop against [Stored XSS (also known as XSS T2) of Category 1](https://security.friendsofpresta.org/modules/2023/02/07/stored-xss.html). If a pSQL function is missing, it could potentially expose your project to critical Stored XSS vulnerabilities due to edge cases. Therefore, it’s crucial to ensure that all relevant functions are properly implemented and used consistently throughout your project.
* Change the default database prefix ps\_ by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skill because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942’s rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.

## **SEO URLs Migration Service: FAQs**

What is SEO URLs migration?

SEO URLs migration is the process of changing website URLs while preserving search engine rankings and maintaining a seamless user experience. This is crucial when moving platforms or restructuring a site.

Why is SEO URLs migration important?

Keeping the same URLs ensures a seamless user experience. Visitors won’t encounter broken links or be redirected, leading to less frustration and lower bounce rates. Plus, it preserves your hard-earned SEO value.

How does URLs migration affect my SEO?

If not handled correctly, URL changes can lead to a significant drop in search rankings and traffic. Broken links confuse search engines, and visitors may abandon your site if they can’t find what they’re looking for.

Can you maintain the URL structure of Source Store after migration?

Each platform has its own structure and rule to write the website address. Therefore when you move your store to a new platform, you cannot keep the same URL by default. There are many sites that users have been building up and developing to have a certain position in Google ranking. It will be a huge damage to your online business if customers cannot find your site at a good place as usual, and they are likely to come to other choices. Even you find a solution to enhance new links, your regular customers could not find your website with the old address and probably meet “404 page not found” error.

Especially, it would be a huge damage if they already registered an account or placed orders in your store. Certainly, while re-platforming for a better customer’s experience, no merchant wants to lose customers.

Can I migrate URLs when migrating to Shopify?

No, you cannot migrate URLs to Shopify. This is due to Shopify’s default URL structure is different from other platforms.

How does your SEO URLs migration service work?

Our service uses automated code to rewrite URLs on the fly. This means that even though your site is on a new platform, the old URLs will still work, leading visitors to the correct pages without redirects.

What platforms do you support SEO URL Migration service?
