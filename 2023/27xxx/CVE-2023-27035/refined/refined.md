The provided content describes a vulnerability related to CVE-2023-27035.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Obsidian application, specifically its Canvas feature, lacks a Session Permission Request handler for embedded web pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper access control allowing embedded web pages within Obsidian Canvas to access sensitive web APIs without explicit user permission.
- Missing permission request handling for web APIs such as microphone access and desktop notifications.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious embedded web pages can silently record user audio through the microphone.
- Attackers can send desktop notifications on behalf of the Obsidian application without user awareness.
-  Other unspecified impacts may occur due to unauthorized access to various web APIs.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by embedding a malicious HTML page with JavaScript code in an Obsidian Canvas.
- The attacker needs to host the HTML content on a server, and then create a canvas file with the URL to that content.
- The user has to open the malicious canvas file with the Obsidian application for the exploit to work.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious HTML page.
- The attacker needs to create a canvas file which references the malicious HTML file.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious canvas file with Obsidian.
- No special privileges are required.
