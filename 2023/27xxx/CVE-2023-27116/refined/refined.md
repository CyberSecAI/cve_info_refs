{
  "cve": "CVE-2023-27116",
  "affected_product": "wabt",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The wasm2c tool in wabt aborts due to an unsupported SIMD instruction/type during the CWriter::MangleType function call.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper error handling for unsupported features. Instead of throwing an exception with a descriptive error, the program aborts."
    ],
    "impact": "The program unexpectedly aborts when encountering SIMD instructions/types during WebAssembly to C conversion.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted WebAssembly file containing SIMD instructions via the wasm2c tool.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a malicious WebAssembly file to the wasm2c tool. No special privileges or user interaction are required, but the user must execute the tool with the malicious file."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The issue was fixed by disabling SIMD in the validator or implementing SIMD support in wasm2c.  The maintainers consider this a non-security issue as it is a well-detected unsupported feature."
