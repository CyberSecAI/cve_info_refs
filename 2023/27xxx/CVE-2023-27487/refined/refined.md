The provided content is related to CVE-2023-27487.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Envoy does not remove the `x-envoy-original-path` header when it is sent from an untrusted client. This header is intended to be internal, and should not be set by external users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: Envoy trusts the `x-envoy-original-path` header even if it originates from an untrusted source. This allows the attacker to set the header to an arbitrary value.
- Use of attacker-controlled data: The forged header is used for logging (trace and gRPC logs) and in the JWT filter, leading to information disclosure and potential bypass of security checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Bypass of JWT checks: By forging the `x-envoy-original-path` header, an attacker can bypass JWT authentication.
- Forged original paths: Attackers can manipulate logs, making it harder to track requests.
- Other upstream uses of the header may be impacted by attacker controlled input.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP request: An attacker can add the `x-envoy-original-path` header to a regular HTTP request when sending it to an Envoy instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Envoy instance. No specific privileges or user interaction is required.
