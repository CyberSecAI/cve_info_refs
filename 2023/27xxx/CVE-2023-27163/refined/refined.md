  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `forward_url` parameter in the `/api/baskets/{name}` and `/baskets/{name}` API endpoints is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can access internal network resources and sensitive information. This includes:\n\n*   Information Disclosure and Exfiltration: Leaking all existing images on the server, as well as any resource accessible via HTTP request on the local network.\n*   Unauthenticated Access to Internal Network HTTP Servers: Connecting to any HTTP server on the same network as the vulnerable server (e.g., internal Nginx servers, RESTful APIs, NoSQL databases, GraphQL databases).\n*   Port and IP Scanning and Enumeration: Scanning for HTTP servers both internal and external, and enumerating machines on the local network with open HTTP ports.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted API request to the `/api/baskets/{name}` or `/baskets/{name}` endpoints, using the `forward_url` parameter to specify the target URL.",
        "Specifically, the attacker sends a POST request to `/api/baskets/{name}` or `/baskets/{name}` with a payload including the malicious `forward_url`.",
      "The server then makes a request to this attacker-controlled URL when the basket is accessed."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required to exploit the SSRF vulnerability."
