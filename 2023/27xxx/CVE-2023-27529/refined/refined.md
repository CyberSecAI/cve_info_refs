Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Wacom Tablet Driver installer for macOS is vulnerable to improper link resolution before file access (CWE-59). This means the installer incorrectly handles symbolic links or similar file system objects when attempting to access files, which could be manipulated by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Link Resolution:** The installer doesn't properly validate symbolic links or similar file system elements before accessing files during the installation process, making it possible for the attacker to redirect file operations to unintended locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By tricking the user into executing a malicious script prior to running the vulnerable installer, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges, which could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have a local presence or be able to execute a script on the target macOS machine before the user runs the vulnerable installer.
- **User Interaction Required:** The user must be tricked into executing a malicious script and then subsequently running the vulnerable installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access or Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a script on the target system prior to the user running the installer. This can be achieved through various means such as social engineering, malware, or prior system compromise.
- **Social Engineering or Trickery:**  The attacker has to convince the user to run the malicious script and then the installer.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Wacom Tablet Driver installers prior to version 6.4.2-1 for macOS.
- The CVSS v3 score is 7.7, indicating a high severity vulnerability
- The CVSS v2 score is 7.6, also indicating a high severity vulnerability
- The vulnerability was reported to IPA by Koh M. Nakagawa.
