Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-27902:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Jenkins creates temporary directories, usually with the `@tmp` name suffix, adjacent to workspace directories for storing build-related temporary files.
- These temporary directories are exposed in the job workspace view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Directory Listing:** Jenkins displays these temporary directories in the job workspace view, even though they are intended for internal use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers with `Item/Workspace` permission can access the contents of these temporary directories, which may contain sensitive data like credentials stored by Jenkins-controlled processes (e.g., SCM tools).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access to the Jenkins web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs to have `Item/Workspace` permission for the Jenkins job.
- No user interaction is required.
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the above permissions.

**Additional Information**

- This vulnerability affects Jenkins versions 2.393 and earlier, and LTS 2.375.3 and earlier.
- The fix is implemented in Jenkins versions 2.394, LTS 2.375.4, and LTS 2.387.1, where temporary directories are no longer listed in job workspaces.
- As a workaround, it is recommended to not grant `Item/Workspace` permission to users who do not have `Item/Configure` permission.
- The Java system property `hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.allowTmpEscape` can be set to `true` to restore the vulnerable behavior.
