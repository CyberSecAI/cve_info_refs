Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3398-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : curl
Version        : 7.64.0-4+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-27533 CVE-2023-27535 CVE-2023-27536 CVE-2023-27538

Several security vulnerabilities have been found in cURL, an easy-to-use
client-side URL transfer library.

CVE-2023-27533

    A vulnerability in input validation exists in curl during
    communication using the TELNET protocol may allow an attacker to pass on
    maliciously crafted user name and "telnet options" during server
    negotiation. The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send
    content or perform option negotiation without the application's intent.
    This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user input,
    thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.

CVE-2023-27535

    An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in the FTP
    connection reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being used
    during subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are kept in a
    connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain
    FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER,
    CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in the
    configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This could
    lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer,
    potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

CVE-2023-27536

    An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in the
    connection reuse feature which can reuse previously established connections
    with incorrect user permissions due to a failure to check for changes in
    the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option. This vulnerability affects
    krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers and could potentially result in
    unauthorized access to sensitive information. The safest option is to not
    reuse connections if the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option has been changed.

CVE-2023-27538

    An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl where it
    reuses a previously established SSH connection despite the fact that an SSH
    option was modified, which should have prevented reuse. libcurl maintains a
    pool of previously used connections to reuse them for subsequent transfers
    if the configurations match. However, two SSH settings were omitted from
    the configuration check, allowing them to match easily, potentially leading
    to the reuse of an inappropriate connection.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
7.64.0-4+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

For the detailed security status of curl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl>

## CVE-2023-27536

# GSS delegation too eager connection re-use

Project curl Security Advisory, March 20th 2023 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-27536.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when the GSS
delegation (`[CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION.html)`) option had been
changed that could have changed the user's permissions in a second
transfer.

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for
subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However,
this GSS delegation setting was left out from the configuration match
checks, making them match too easily, affecting
krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers.

## INFO

CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.22.0](vuln-7.22.0.html) to and including [7.88.1](vuln-7.88.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.22.0](vuln-7.22.0.html) and curl >= [8.0.0](vuln-8.0.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ebf42c4be76df4>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/cb49e67303dba>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [8.0.0](vuln-8.0.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use the `[CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION.html)` option

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on March 7, 2023. We
contacted distros@openwall on March 13, 2023.

curl [8.0.0](vuln-8.0.0.html) was released on March 20 2023, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
