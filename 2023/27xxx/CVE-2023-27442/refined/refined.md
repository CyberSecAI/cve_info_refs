- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Leyka plugin for WordPress versions <= 3.29.2 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to force authenticated users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted request that exploits the lack of CSRF protection in the plugin. An attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into submitting a malicious request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into sending that request to the vulnerable WordPress site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
