The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the ChurchCRM application, specifically within the edit group function.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input validation and output encoding in the backend when editing group names. This allows malicious JavaScript or HTML code to be stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability in `/churchcrm/GroupList.php`.
- Lack of server-side input validation to prevent the injection of malicious code.
- Lack of output encoding when displaying the group names.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code.
- When a victim accesses the affected page, the malicious code executes within their browser.
- This allows attackers to steal sensitive information, hijack user sessions, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the edit group name function in the ChurchCRM application.
- An attacker can insert malicious code into the group name field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the edit group functionality to inject the malicious code. This likely requires having sufficient user permissions to edit group names within the application.

**Technical Details:**
- The malicious code, such as `<img src=1 onclick=alert(document.cookie)>`, is stored in the database when a group name is edited. This code is then executed when another user visits the page displaying the group name.
