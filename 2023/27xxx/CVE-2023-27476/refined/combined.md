Package        : owslib
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-27476
Debian Bug     : 1034182

An arbitrary file reads from malformed XML payload vulnerbility was
discovered in owslib, the Python client library for Open Geospatial (OGC)
web services. This issue has been addressed by always using lxml as the
XML parser with entity resolution disabled.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.23.0-1+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your owslib packages.

For the detailed security status of owslib please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/owslib>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# XML External Entity (XXE) Injection in OWSLib

High

[tomkralidis](/tomkralidis)
published
GHSA-8h9c-r582-mggc
Mar 6, 2023

## Package

pip

OWSLib
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 0.28.1

## Patched versions

0.28.1

## Description

### Impact

OWSLib's XML parser (which supports both `lxml` and `xml.etree`) does not disable entity resolution for `lxml`, and could lead to arbitrary file reads from an attacker-controlled XML payload. This affects all XML parsing in the codebase.

### Patches

* Use only lxml for XML handling, adding `resolve_entities=False` to `lxml`'s parser: [#863](https://github.com/geopython/OWSLib/pull/863)

### Workarounds

```
patch_well_known_namespaces(etree)
etree.set_default_parser(
    parser=etree.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)
)
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
