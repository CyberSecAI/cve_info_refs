Moderate

[martenson](/martenson)
published
GHSA-j8q2-r4g5-f22j
Mar 20, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

likely all

## Patched versions

>= 22.01

## Description

Attacker can modify or delete any Galaxy Visualization or Galaxy Page given they know the encoded ID of it. Additionally they can copy or import any Galaxy Visualization given they know the encoded ID of it.

### Impact

All supported versions of Galaxy are affected i.e. 22.01, 22.05, and 23.0. Unsupported versions are likely affected as far back as the functionality of Visualizations/Pages exists.

### Patches

* Galaxy 22.01: <https://depot.galaxyproject.org/patch/GX-2023-0001/modify_pages_viz-release_22.01.patch>
* Galaxy 22.05: <https://depot.galaxyproject.org/patch/GX-2023-0001/modify_pages_viz-release_22.05.patch>
* Galaxy 23.0: <https://depot.galaxyproject.org/patch/GX-2023-0001/modify_pages_viz-release_23.0.patch>

To apply the patch, navigate to the root of your Galaxy directory, then execute:

```
wget -O - "URL of the patch for your version from above" | patch -p1

```

or:

```
curl "URL of the patch for your version from above" | patch -p1

```

You can test application of the patch before applying it by adding the --dry-run flag to patch.

For the changes to take effect, you must restart all Galaxy server processes.

All supported branches of Galaxy (>= release\_22.01) were amended with the supplied patches.

### Workarounds

You must apply the supplied patch or update to the release\_22.01 or newer. There are no supported workarounds.
