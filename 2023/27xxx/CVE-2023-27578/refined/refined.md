* **Root Cause:** Insufficient permission checks when modifying, deleting, copying, or importing Galaxy Visualizations or Pages.
* **Weaknesses:**
    * **CWE-284:** Improper Access Control. The application fails to properly verify if a user has the necessary permissions before allowing actions on visualizations and pages.
* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * An attacker can modify or delete any Galaxy Visualization or Page if they know the encoded ID.
    * An attacker can copy or import any Galaxy Visualization if they know the encoded ID.
    * This can lead to unauthorized alteration or deletion of data, potentially disrupting workflows and compromising data integrity.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * The attack vector is through the web interface of Galaxy, using the encoded IDs of visualizations and pages.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to know the encoded ID of the target Visualization or Page.
    * The attacker must have access to the Galaxy instance (likely as an authenticated user but without the privileges expected for the requested operation.)

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects all supported versions of Galaxy (22.01, 22.05, and 23.0), and likely older unsupported versions as well.
* Patches are available for each supported version.
* There are no supported workarounds other than patching.
* The vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed by @familiardisaster using the huntr.dev platform.
