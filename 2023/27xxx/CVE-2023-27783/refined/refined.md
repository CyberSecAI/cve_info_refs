  "CVE-2023-27783": {
    "description": "An issue found in TCPreplay tcprewrite v.4.4.3 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via the tcpedit_dlt_cleanup function at plugins/dlt_plugins.c.",
    "affected_versions": "v4.4.3 and prior",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `tcpedit_dlt_cleanup` function within `plugins/dlt_plugins.c`. Specifically, when the program processes a crafted pcap file in `DLT_JUNIPER_ETHER` mode, it reaches an assertion failure due to an incorrect context check during cleanup. The root cause is a missing check for the subcontext (`subctx`) before calling `tcpedit_dlt_cleanup()`, leading to a null pointer dereference when `ctx` is null.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reachable assertion in `tcpedit_dlt_cleanup()`",
      "Missing check for `subctx` before calling `tcpedit_dlt_cleanup()`"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted pcap file which triggers the assertion failure, leading to program termination.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack via crafted pcap file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted pcap file to `tcprewrite` running with `--dlt=jnpr_eth` mode."
