The provided content details a buffer overflow vulnerability in Tenda V15EV1.0 router firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `modifyWifiFilterRules` function within the `/bin/httpd` binary does not properly validate the length of input parameters `pRuleMac` and `pRuleDesc`, which are passed via a POST request.
- The `sprintf()` function is used to copy these parameters to a buffer without checking their length leading to a buffer overflow when a large string is provided for the input fields `wifiFilterListRemark`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer Overflow: Lack of input validation on the length of `pRuleMac` and `pRuleDesc` before copying them into a fixed-size buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Sending an overly long string causes the httpd process to crash leading to a denial of service.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: The buffer overflow overwrites the return address on the stack potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code by crafting a suitable exploit.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `/goform/modifyWifiFilterRules` endpoint.
- The `wifiFilterListRemark` parameter in the POST request is used to trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router.
- Typically, this implies the attacker is on the same network as the router.
- No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability, it appears.
