Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-27180:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **incorrect access control** in the `backup.php` file located within the administrative directory (`_admin`) of the GDidees CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Access:** The `backup.php` file, responsible for generating site backups, can be accessed without proper authentication or authorization.
*   **Insecure Backup Storage:** The generated backup archives are stored in a publicly accessible directory (`_db-backups`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker can access the `backup.php` script and trigger the creation of a zipped backup of the entire web root. This backup includes:
    *   Source code of the GDidees CMS installation.
    *   Database credentials.
    *   Private files.
    *   Potentially other applications residing in the same webroot, outside of the GDidees CMS itself.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** By obtaining the database credentials and source code, an attacker can fully compromise the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the `backup.php` file through a web browser via the URL: `{URL}/_admin/backup.php`.
*   **Backup Download:**  The attacker then accesses the backup archive in the publicly accessible `{URL}/_db-backups/` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the target system.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any form of authentication.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** GDidees CMS version 3.9.1 and lower are vulnerable.
*   **Reference:** The vulnerability is documented by Hadi Mene.
*   **PclZip library:** The provided github content refers to "chamilo/pclzip", which is an unofficial fork of the PclZip library which is likely used by GDidees for creating zip archives. However, the vulnerability is not related to a vulnerability in the PclZip library but to a flaw in how GDidees implements its backup feature.
