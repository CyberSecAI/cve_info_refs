The content is related to CVE-2023-27916.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing font files (e.g., FNT).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: By opening a maliciously crafted font file (FNT file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to provide a malicious font file to the vulnerable application. The attack complexity is low and it requires user interaction.
