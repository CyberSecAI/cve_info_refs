Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-27760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an untrusted search path in Wondershare Filmora, specifically within the `filmora_setup_full846.exe` installer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Untrusted Search Path:** The application or installer searches for required files in locations that are not secured or controlled by the application itself, allowing an attacker to place malicious files in those locations that will be executed instead of the legitimate ones.
- This is identified by CWE-426 (Untrusted Search Path)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including malware installation, data theft, or system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack Vector:**  The attack vector is classified as "Local". This likely means that an attacker needs some form of access or presence on the targeted system to carry out the attack.
- **Installer Modification:** It appears the attacker needs to manipulate the execution environment of the installer to insert malicious files in an uncontrolled path the installer searches.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction Required:** User interaction is required for exploitation. The user would need to execute a modified version of the installer or be tricked into launching it after an attacker has created the necessary malicious files in the untrusted path.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low, meaning that the exploit does not require sophisticated techniques to carry out once the malicious file is present and the user launches the vulnerable installer.
- **No Privileges Required:** The vulnerability does not require any special privileges to be exploited.
- **Remote Attacker:** Although the vulnerability is classified as local, the Github description mentions that it allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands. This seems to imply a local vulnerability that can be triggered by remote actions of an attacker.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Version:** Wondershare Filmora version 12.0.9 is specifically mentioned as being affected.
- **Exploit Title:** "Wondershare Filmora Untrusted Search Path Vulnerability"
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.8 (High), with the following base metrics: AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
- **EPSS Score:** The EPSS score is 0.163% (54th percentile), meaning it's relatively less frequently exploited compared to other vulnerabilities.

In summary, this is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that requires user interaction, where an attacker leverages an untrusted search path in the Wondershare Filmora installer to execute arbitrary commands.
