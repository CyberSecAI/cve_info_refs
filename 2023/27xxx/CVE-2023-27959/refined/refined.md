- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a memory handling issue in the Apple Neural Engine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a generic memory handling issue, which can be exploited if an attacker has the ability to trigger specific code paths within the Apple Neural Engine.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an app to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. This means a malicious app can gain full control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: An app running on the targeted device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious app on a vulnerable device.
