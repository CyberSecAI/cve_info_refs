**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   A double-free vulnerability exists in `sudo`'s per-command chroot feature, specifically in how the command's path is handled.
    *   The root cause is a memory leak fix in the `set_cmnd_path()` function that, when a `CHROOT` setting is present in sudoers rule, the `user_cmnd` variable is freed twice.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Double-Free:** The core vulnerability is a double-free, meaning a memory region is released more than once, leading to heap corruption or potentially other undefined behavior.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered specifically with `per-command chroot` sudoers rules.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to a crash, as mentioned in the NetApp advisory.
	*   Other impacts, such as disclosure of sensitive information or modification of data, are also mentioned in the NetApp advisory but not in the other documents.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is the use of a vulnerable version of `sudo` configured with a per-command chroot (`CHROOT`) sudoers rule.
    *   This specific setting is required to trigger the vulnerability, but not the global `chroot` Defaults setting.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker must be a user with sudo privileges granted via a sudoers rule that includes the `CHROOT` option in a matching rule.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to execute `sudo` on a vulnerable system and have a rule that contains the vulnerable condition.
	*   The attacker must be in a matching host of the sudoer rules containing `CHROOT` settings.

**3. Additional Details and Technical Descriptions:**

*   **Affected Sudo Versions:**  Sudo versions 1.9.8 through 1.9.13p1 (inclusive) are vulnerable, while versions prior to 1.9.8 are not affected. This is more specific than the placeholder description in the CVE itself.
*   **Trigger Details:** The double-free occurs when the `set_cmnd_path()` function frees the `user_cmnd` variable twice when a `CHROOT` setting is present in a sudoers rule and when the rule matches the current host.
*   **Workaround:** Remove or avoid using sudoers rules that use the per-command `CHROOT` setting. This is mentioned in multiple sources including openwall.
*   **Fix:** Sudo 1.9.13p2 patches this vulnerability by fixing the memory leak in the `set_cmnd_path()` function.

**4. NetApp Advisory Specifics:**

*   NetApp states that this vulnerability, if exploited, could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).
*   NetApp assigned a CVSS score of 7.2 (HIGH) with vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   Most NetApp products are listed as *Not Affected*, with `NetApp HCI Compute Node (Bootstrap OS)` being *Under Investigation* at the time of the advisory.
*   They also state no workarounds are currently available

**5. Gentoo Advisory Specifics:**

*   Gentoo identifies multiple CVEs in their advisory, including this one.
*   They assess the severity as high, and the attack vector as remote.

**Summary:**

This CVE details a double-free vulnerability in sudo that can be triggered with a specific configuration (per-command chroot in sudoers rules). Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service. The vulnerability affects sudo versions 1.9.8 through 1.9.13p1, and is fixed in sudo 1.9.13p2. The provided information is more detailed than the placeholder CVE description and includes specifics about vulnerable configurations, how the vulnerability is triggered and how to fix it.
