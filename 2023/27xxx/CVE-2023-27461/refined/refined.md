Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The WordPress "When Last Login" plugin versions 1.2.1 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions on the WordPress site while authenticated. The specific impact depends on the actions the targeted user can perform.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage. This triggers a request to the vulnerable WordPress plugin endpoint, leveraging the user's existing authentication.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into triggering it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
