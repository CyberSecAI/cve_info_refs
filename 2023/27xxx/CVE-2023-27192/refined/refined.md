{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Super Security app loads data from SharedPreference files upon opening and uses this data in important functions. A malicious app can modify this data, causing the Super Security app to behave improperly.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper access control on SharedPreference files, allowing modification by malicious apps. This is due to the application's SharedPreference files being accessible to other applications on the same device.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can modify SharedPreference data to achieve several malicious objectives including:\n- Control the server URL the victim app accesses.\n- Add malicious apps to the virus scan whitelist.\n- Manipulate ad blocking functionality.\nThe injected data persists even after rebooting the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious application running on the same device as the vulnerable Super Security app.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an application installed on the same device as the vulnerable Super Security app. The attacker's application needs the ability to modify the SharedPreference files of the Super Security application."
