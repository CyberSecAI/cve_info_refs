    - Unauthorized data modification or deletion.
    - Plugin configuration changes.
    - Privilege escalation.
    - Other actions as defined by the vulnerable plugin's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

    - Embedding the malicious code in an email or malicious website.
    - Using social engineering to lure the user into clicking a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated access:** The attacker does not need to have any credentials on the target WordPress site.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious site or clicking a link they control.
- **Target User:** The user must be logged into the WordPress site when the attack is executed.

**Additional Information:**
