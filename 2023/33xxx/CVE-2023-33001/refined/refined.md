This document provides details for multiple CVEs, and this specific entry concerns CVE-2023-33001.

**CVE-2023-33001**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The HashiCorp Vault Plugin does not properly mask credentials printed in the build log from Pipeline steps like `sh` and `bat`. This happens when the credentials are printed in build steps executing on an agent and push mode for durable task logging is enabled.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper masking of credentials.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Credentials printed in build logs are not masked, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker can view the unmasked credentials in the build logs. This requires the attacker to have access to the build logs, and the vulnerability is triggered when pipeline steps using 'sh' or 'bat' are used on an agent with push mode logging enabled.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least read access to the build logs. Also, to trigger the vulnerability, push mode for durable task logging needs to be enabled, and the credentials must be printed by pipeline steps 'sh' or 'bat' running on an agent.

The document also notes a workaround present in Credentials Binding plugin 523.525.vb\_72269281873 which implements masking even in affected plugins, but mentions it is temporary and incomplete. It recommends updating the plugin to fix this issue. However, as of the publication of the advisory, there is no fix available for this vulnerability.
