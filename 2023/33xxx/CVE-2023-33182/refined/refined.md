Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Nextcloud Contacts application did not properly sanitize SVG files used as contact avatars. Specifically, the mime type matching was case-sensitive instead of case-insensitive. This could lead to an unsanitized SVG being processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The core issue was the lack of proper sanitization of SVG files. While the vulnerability description states that the unsanitized SVG is converted to a JavaScript blob which the avatar canâ€™t render, the vulnerability lies in the missing sanitization itself.
*   **Case-Sensitive Mime Type Matching:** The application was using a case-sensitive check on the mime type of uploaded files which allowed `image/svg+xml` to pass unsanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   According to the description, the unsanitized SVG file is converted to a JavaScript blob that the Avatar can't render. This does not seem to be exploitable, leading to a low severity rating.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker could upload a malicious SVG file as a contact avatar.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to add or modify contacts within the Nextcloud Contacts application, which implies having at least low privileges.
*   No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability after the malicious SVG is uploaded.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix was to implement case-insensitive mime type matching, ensuring that SVGs are properly sanitized.
*   The vulnerability is rated as low severity because the unsanitized SVG does not render, but the missing sanitization is still a vulnerability to address.
