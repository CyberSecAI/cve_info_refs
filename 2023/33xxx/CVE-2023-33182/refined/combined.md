# Contacts - PHOTO svg only sanitized if mime type is all lower case

Low

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-hxr6-cx85-gcjx
May 25, 2023

## Package

Contacts
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

≥ v5.0.0, ≥ v4.1.0

## Patched versions

v5.0.3, v4.2.4

## Description

### Impact

The unsanitized SVG is converted to a JavaScript blob (in memory data) that the Avatar can't render. Due to this constellation the missing sanitization does not seem to be exploitable.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Contacts app is upgraded to 5.0.3 or 4.2.4

### Workarounds

* Disable Contacts app

### References

* [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/1789602)
* [PullRequest](https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts/pull/3199)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-33182
