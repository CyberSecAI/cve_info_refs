  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2023-33255",
    "description": "User supplied input in the form of DICOM or NIFTI images can be loaded into the Papaya web application without any kind of sanitization. This allows to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the image's metadata which will in consequence be executed as soon as the metadata is displayed in the Papaya web application.",
    "root_cause": "The Papaya web application does not sanitize user-supplied input in DICOM or NIFTI image metadata.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Papaya web application. This can lead to impersonation or session theft, potentially disclosing sensitive medical data.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker can craft a malicious DICOM or NIFTI image with embedded JavaScript in the metadata. When a user opens the image and views the metadata, the injected script executes within the user's browser.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious image to the victim. In the reported case, the attacker was able to upload the image to a server and cause other users to view it.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when the 'Show Header' functionality is used to display metadata. The 'Manufacturer' metadata field was specifically targeted, but other fields may be vulnerable as well.\n\nThe vendor was unresponsive to initial reports, but fixed the vulnerability after a public disclosure timeline was announced."
