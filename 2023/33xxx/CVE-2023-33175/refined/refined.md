Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-33175:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the use of `Flask-Caching` (specifically `SimpleCache`) to store user variables in the ToUI application. The developer mistakenly believed that these caches were stored client-side (in the browser), but they are actually stored server-side. This results in user-specific variables being shared across different users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Data Storage:** User-specific data was incorrectly stored in a shared server-side cache rather than being isolated per user session. This exposes the data to other users of the application.
- **Misunderstanding of Caching Mechanism:** A misunderstanding of how Flask-Caching's `SimpleCache` works led to this vulnerability.
- **User-Specific Variables**: The `Website.user_vars` property was used to store user-specific information which was then accessible by other users due to the shared server-side cache.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** User-specific data, intended to be private, is leaked and visible to other users of the application using the same website. This could include sensitive user information, session data, or other potentially confidential variables.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves any user accessing the website, particularly those who use features relying on the `Website.user_vars` property.
- Any user can potentially see the `user_vars` of another user due to the shared cache.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Regular User Access:** No specific attacker capabilities are required. Any user of a vulnerable website is able to see other user's variables.
- The attacker simply needs to use the web application and interact with features that make use of the `Website.user_vars` property or use the `Website.signin_user()` in version 2.4.0.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects ToUI versions v2.0.1 and v2.4.0.
- The fix was implemented in version v2.4.1, which uses `session.sid` to store user variables, ensuring proper isolation.
- A workaround for versions v2.0.1 to v2.4.0 is to avoid using `Website.user_vars`, and in version 2.4.0 avoid using `Website.signin_user()`.
- The severity of the vulnerability is marked as "Critical".
- No CWEs are listed for this vulnerability.
