Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2023-33741:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect access control implementation in the com.macrovideo.v380pro application (version 1.4.97). Specifically, when a device is shared, the cloud service transmits the device's ID and password to the shared user. Even after the owner revokes the sharing, the previously shared user retains the device ID and password.
*   **Weakness:** The core weakness is the failure to invalidate or revoke shared user access when the device owner unshares the device. This leads to the retention of sensitive information (device ID and password) by the former shared user, allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker (former shared user) can receive alarm messages from the device, even after the sharing is revoked. This unauthorized access to alarm notifications indicates a broader potential to monitor or interact with the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the device sharing feature of the application. When a device is shared and then unshared, the vulnerability is triggered if the former shared user still has the device ID and password.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have previously been a "shared user" of the device, meaning they were granted access via the application's sharing feature.
    *   They must have received the device ID and password during the sharing period.
    *   The attacker does not need to be the owner, and can continue using the device ID and password even after the owner unshares the device.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability lies in the application's failure to properly revoke access after a device has been unshared.  A user who had access during the sharing period can continue to receive alarm notifications after the sharing has been revoked.  This can have serious security implications.
