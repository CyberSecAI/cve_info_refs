# Missing "--allow-net" permission check for built-in Node modules

High

[bartlomieju](/bartlomieju)
published
GHSA-vc52-gwm3-8v2f
May 30, 2023

## Package

deno
(deno)

## Affected versions

=1.34.0

## Patched versions

1.34.1

deno\_runtime
(deno)

=0.114.0

0.115.0

## Description

### Impact

Outbound HTTP requests made using the built-in "node:http" or "node:https" modules are incorrectly not checked against the network permission allow list (`--allow-net`). Dependencies relying on these built-in modules are subject to the vulnerability too.

Users of Deno versions prior to 1.34.0 are unaffected. Deno Deploy users are unaffected.

### Patches

This problem has been patched in Deno v1.34.1 and all users are recommended to update to this version.

### Workarounds

No workaround is available for this issue.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-33966

### Weaknesses

[CWE-269](/advisories?query=cwe%3A269)
