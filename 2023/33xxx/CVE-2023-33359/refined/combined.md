### **[2308652512](/2308652512)** commented [May 1, 2023](#issue-1690372075)

| This vulnerability lies in the 'add tags' function in the backend. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27283436/235408051-ac0c44e8-32e0-4912-a260-83f0b8891db2.png)  Try creating a new label here. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27283436/235408127-ba083289-7885-4be2-8ce4-942db7401af2.png)  Use burpsuite to intercept this request. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27283436/235408173-fba8ba87-c076-44ff-8d9d-f676b012bc1a.png)  You can see that CSRF-Token does not exist here,So we can generate a CSRF POC. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27283436/235408363-e77366d5-a4a7-4f7c-8171-f6a647328a34.png)  Execute this poc,note that there are no tags here at this time [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27283436/235408598-989972f6-1af3-4c2f-a910-3ce86b9dda7e.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27283436/235408639-8b68b254-ab51-4a28-b1bf-ac3849c3ba89.png)  After executing the POC, it was found that there were new tags added [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27283436/235408695-1388a381-607f-4234-a33c-87df2daabe70.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27283436/235408722-176217b6-0685-4378-bfcf-816576092fe8.png) //CSRF POC: ` <script> history.pushState('', '', '/'); document.forms[0].submit(); </script> ` Of course, only one CSRF vulnerability is not serious. Next, I will demonstrate the possibility of combining it with XSS vulnerabilities for exploitation |

### **[plegall](/plegall)** commented [May 5, 2023](#issuecomment-1535889768)

| You're right, there is no `pwg_token` parameter on the `pwg.tags.add` API method. We don't plan to have one. Adding a tag is not much of a problem and I don't want to break the 3rd party apps using this method.  We already have this parameter (preventing from CSRF attacks) on `pwg.tags.delete` or `pwg.tags.merge`. |
