Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The 'add tags' function in the backend of Piwigo lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection. Specifically, the `pwg.tags.add` API method does not include a `pwg_token` parameter which is used to prevent CSRF attacks in other API methods such as `pwg.tags.delete` or `pwg.tags.merge`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The absence of CSRF protection in the 'add tags' functionality makes it susceptible to cross-site request forgery attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can force a logged-in user to add arbitrary tags to the Piwigo photo gallery without the user's consent or knowledge. While the impact of adding a tag may seem minor on its own, it could be combined with other vulnerabilities for more significant harm.
* The developer has stated that they don't plan to add a token, so this will be a permanent vulnerability unless they change their minds.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page (or similar) containing a form that makes a request to the vulnerable 'add tags' endpoint of the Piwigo application.
*   The attacker then tricks a logged-in user into visiting the malicious page (e.g., through phishing or other social engineering means).
*   When the user visits the page, the attacker's form is automatically submitted to the Piwigo server.
*   If the user is authenticated with Piwigo, the request will be successfully processed by the server, adding the attacker's desired tags using the user's session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious page.
*   The attacker must trick a logged-in Piwigo user into visiting their malicious page.
* The user must have an active session with Piwigo for the attack to succeed.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content includes a Proof-of-Concept (POC) HTML code snippet that demonstrates the vulnerability:
```html
<script>
 history.pushState('', '', '/');
 document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
```
* The vulnerability was reported to affect Piwigo version 13.6.0.
* The developer has acknowledged the vulnerability but has stated that they do not plan to fix it for compatibility reasons.
