- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$_GET['id']`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive information (like database name in this case), modify or delete data, or potentially gain further access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the URL of `/eval/admin/manage_task.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed to reach this endpoint.
