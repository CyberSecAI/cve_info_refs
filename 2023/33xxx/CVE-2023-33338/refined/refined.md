```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application's login functionality is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the username parameter.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can bypass authentication, gain unauthorized access to the admin account, and potentially take complete control of the application. This could lead to data breaches, modification, or loss for all users and the application itself.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is the login form, specifically the 'username' parameter in the HTTP POST request to `/oahms/admin/login.php`.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and know the location of the login form to inject the SQL payload.
