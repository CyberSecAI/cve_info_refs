        "attack_vectors": [
          "The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL that includes JavaScript code in the query parameters.",
           "A remote attacker can send the malicious link to a victim via email or other means and if the victim clicks on the link, the malicious javascript code will get executed in the victims browser session."

No authentication is required to exploit the XSS itself, although stealing an authenticated user session requires a valid user to be logged in. The attacker does not need direct access to the eScan application or server."
