```
{
  "Root cause": "A malformed proposed entry of the `intoto/v0.0.2` type can cause a panic on a thread within the Rekor process.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "The code does not properly handle malformed `intoto/v0.0.2` entries, specifically those with missing or malformed signature fields such as `PublicKey` or `Sig`.",
     "Lack of defensive checks when unmarshalling the signatures within an intoto envelope, allowing null values or missing data to cause a panic."
  ],
  "Impact": "A panic on a thread within the Rekor process. While the thread is recovered, the client receives a 500 error message. The service continues to run with minimal availability impact.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network. An attacker can send a malformed `intoto/v0.0.2` entry to the Rekor service.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Rekor service."
