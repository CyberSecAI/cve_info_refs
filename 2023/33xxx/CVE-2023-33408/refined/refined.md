The provided content relates to CVE-2023-33408.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Edit Room Note" functionality of the Minical application. Specifically, the application does not encode or validate user input before storing and displaying it on the user interface which leads to stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected content. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Stealing of sensitive information like cookies or authentication tokens.
    - Other malicious actions within the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects the malicious payload through the "Edit Room Note" field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the ability to access and edit room notes within the Minical application.
