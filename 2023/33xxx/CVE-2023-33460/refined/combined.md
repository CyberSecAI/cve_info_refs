| 3. crash input: "{"@\\n\\""  It is slightly ambiguous whether the leading and trailing quotes here were intended to be part of the example JSON document. AFAICT though, to get the same set of *three* LeakSanitizer reports, requires *omitting* the leading/trailing quotes. i.e. parsing this document:  ``` {"@\\\n\\\\"  ```  And these three leaks were actually fixed by a much older commit: [openEuler-BaseService@3d65cb0c](https://github.com/openEuler-BaseService/yajl/commit/3d65cb0c6db4d433e5e42ee7d91d8a04e21337cf)  If you include the trailing and leading quotes, asking it to parse this document:  ``` "{"@\\\n\\\\""  ```  Then you only get *two* different leaks:  ``` ==642532==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks  Direct leak of 40 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:     #0 0x7fa2aa2d92ff in malloc (/lib64/libasan.so.8+0xd92ff) (BuildId: dc689b05ca2577037af24700212bb5cce1f91c8a)     #1 0x403b5c in value_alloc /home/berrange/src/external/yajl/src/yajl_tree.c:63     #2 0x403b5c in handle_string /home/berrange/src/external/yajl/src/yajl_tree.c:276  Indirect leak of 2 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:     #0 0x7fa2aa2d92ff in malloc (/lib64/libasan.so.8+0xd92ff) (BuildId: dc689b05ca2577037af24700212bb5cce1f91c8a)     #1 0x403ba1 in handle_string /home/berrange/src/external/yajl/src/yajl_tree.c:280  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: 42 byte(s) leaked in 2 allocation(s).  ```  and they are indeed fixed by this newer commit:  please refer to: [openEuler-BaseService@23a122e](https://github.com/openEuler-BaseService/yajl/commit/23a122eddaa28165a6c219000adcc31ff9a8a698)  IOW, anyone patching a vanilla lloyd yajl 2.1.0 needs to pull both commits  [openEuler-BaseService@23a122e](https://github.com/openEuler-BaseService/yajl/commit/23a122eddaa28165a6c219000adcc31ff9a8a698) [openEuler-BaseService@3d65cb0c](https://github.com/openEuler-BaseService/yajl/commit/3d65cb0c6db4d433e5e42ee7d91d8a04e21337cf) |

| CMake is the worst abomination, perhaps ever, in the software world, and certainly in the software configuration and construction sphere.  Try my "fork" using BSD Make to build and test:  <https://github.com/robohack/yajl>  I've already fixed this problem, and I'll be making a new release in the next week or so. |

| That's not the right way to run `parse_config`. It only reads input from standard input and ignores all its command-line parameters. In the way you've run it the program is waiting for you to type the input to it. You can echo the input to it on a pipeline, or redirect it's input from a file.  The regression tests run by `bmake regress` will do that test (in the `example` subdirectory). Not with the exact same input, but exercising what was the same bug. |

Package        : burp
Version        : 2.1.32-2+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-16516 CVE-2022-24795 CVE-2023-33460
Debian Bug     : 1040036

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the version of yajl bundled
with burp, a simple cross-platform network BackUp and Restore Program.
yajl is a JSON parser and small validating JSON generator.

CVE-2017-16516

  When a crafted JSON file is supplied to yajl, the process might
  crash with a SIGABRT in the yajl_string_decode function in
  yajl_encode.c.  This potentially results in a denial of service.

CVE-2022-24795

  The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer
  overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing
  with large (~2GB) inputs.

CVE-2023-33460

  There's a memory leak in yajl 2.1.0 with use of yajl_tree_parse
  function, which potentially cause the server to run out of memory and
  crash.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
2.1.32-2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your burp packages.

For the detailed security status of burp please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/burp>

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 38 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [Add FORTIFY\_SOURCE=3](/wiki/Changes/Add_FORTIFY_SOURCE%3D3_to_distribution_build_flags "Changes/Add FORTIFY SOURCE=3 to distribution build flags")
* [fno-omit-frame-pointer](/wiki/Changes/fno-omit-frame-pointer "Changes/fno-omit-frame-pointer")
* [Perl replace MODULE\_COMPAT by generator](/wiki/Changes/Perl_replace_MODULE_COMPAT_by_generator "Changes/Perl replace MODULE COMPAT by generator")

## Before the rebuild

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, January 18th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f38
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to the next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to the next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f38. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f38 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f38
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages are currently built from the source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-01-19 15:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on Libera.CHAT IRC.

**********************************************************************
        This is YAJL 2.  For the legacy version of YAJL see
              <https://github.com/lloyd/yajl/tree/1.x>
**********************************************************************

Welcome to Yet Another JSON Library (YAJL)

## Why does the world need another C library for parsing JSON?

Good question.  In a review of current C JSON parsing libraries I was
unable to find one that satisfies my requirements.  Those are,
0. written in C
1. portable
2. robust -- as close to "crash proof" as possible
3. data representation independent
4. fast
5. generates verbose, useful error messages including context of where
   the error occurs in the input text.
6. can parse JSON data off a stream, incrementally
7. simple to use
8. tiny

Numbers 3, 5, 6, and 7 were particularly hard to find, and were what
caused me to ultimately create YAJL.  This document is a tour of some
of the more important aspects of YAJL.

## YAJL is Free.

Permissive licensing means you can use it in open source and
commercial products alike without any fees.  My request beyond the
licensing is that if you find bugs drop me a email, or better yet,
fork and fix.

Porting YAJL should be trivial, the implementation is ANSI C.  If you
port to new systems I'd love to hear of it and integrate your patches.

## YAJL is data representation independent.

BYODR!  Many JSON libraries impose a structure based data representation
on you.  This is a benefit in some cases and a drawback in others.
YAJL uses callbacks to remain agnostic of the in-memory representation.
So if you wish to build up an in-memory representation, you may do so
using YAJL, but you must bring the code that defines and populates the
in memory structure.

This also means that YAJL can be used by other (higher level) JSON
libraries if so desired.

## YAJL supports stream parsing

This means you do not need to hold the whole JSON representation in
textual form in memory.  This makes YAJL ideal for filtering projects,
where you're converting YAJL from one form to another (i.e. XML).  The
included JSON pretty printer is an example of such a filter program.

## YAJL is fast

Minimal memory copying is performed.  YAJL, when possible, returns
pointers into the client provided text (i.e. for strings that have no
embedded escape chars, hopefully the common case).  I've put a lot of
effort into profiling and tuning performance, but I have ignored a
couple possible performance improvements to keep the interface clean,
small, and flexible.  My hope is that YAJL will perform comparably to
the fastest JSON parser out there.

YAJL should impose both minimal CPU and memory requirements on your
application.

## YAJL is tiny.

Fat free.  No whip.

enjoy,
Lloyd - July, 2007

# CVE-2022-24795

| **Name** | CVE-2022-24795 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl\_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size\_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size\_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL. |

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2072912#c0)  Vipul Nair    2022-04-07 09:24:00 UTC  ``` yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.

Is it in v2.1?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2072912#c10)  Vipul Nair    2024-01-15 17:43:11 UTC  ``` I think maintainers decided it was not an issue for Yajl and the fix is only applied for yajl-ruby as per maintainers comment. <https://github.com/lloyd/yajl/pull/240>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2072912#c11)  Vipul Nair    2024-01-15 17:44:30 UTC  ``` the infinite loop that they are talking about seems to fixed in <https://github.com/robohack/yajl/commit/166b384aec1cf304859d69f03e42c3ab85c34858> yajl release 2.2   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2072912#c12)  Tom Sweeney    2024-01-16 15:33:37 UTC  ``` @vinair thanks for the update, we'll push to update with yajl release 2.2.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2072912#c13)  Tom Sweeney    2024-01-16 15:45:17 UTC  ``` Vipul, yet another question.  This is not a GitHub Repo that I've seen before or was aware of <https://github.com/robohack/yajl>.   Is this the valid repo to use?   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2072912#c14)  Vipul Nair    2024-01-17 12:19:12 UTC  ``` ohh my bad for not being more descriptive, I was merely showing you the fix,if you wish to implement it.I dont think lloyd /yajl is actively being maintained.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2072912#c15)  Tom Sweeney    2024-01-17 20:43:16 UTC  ``` Ah, gotcha Vipul. Thanks for the follow-up and the pointer.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2072912#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-25 15:07:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:2063 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2063](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2063)   ``` |  |

**********************************************************************
        This is YAJL 2.  For the legacy version of YAJL see
              <https://github.com/lloyd/yajl/tree/1.x>
**********************************************************************

Welcome to Yet Another JSON Library (YAJL)

## Why does the world need another C library for parsing JSON?

Good question.  In a review of current C JSON parsing libraries I was
unable to find one that satisfies my requirements.  Those are,
0. written in C
1. portable
2. robust -- as close to "crash proof" as possible
3. data representation independent
4. fast
5. generates verbose, useful error messages including context of where
   the error occurs in the input text.
6. can parse JSON data off a stream, incrementally
7. simple to use
8. tiny

Numbers 3, 5, 6, and 7 were particularly hard to find, and were what
caused me to ultimately create YAJL.  This document is a tour of some
of the more important aspects of YAJL.

## YAJL is Free.

Permissive licensing means you can use it in open source and
commercial products alike without any fees.  My request beyond the
licensing is that if you find bugs drop me a email, or better yet,
fork and fix.

Porting YAJL should be trivial, the implementation is ANSI C.  If you
port to new systems I'd love to hear of it and integrate your patches.

## YAJL is data representation independent.

BYODR!  Many JSON libraries impose a structure based data representation
on you.  This is a benefit in some cases and a drawback in others.
YAJL uses callbacks to remain agnostic of the in-memory representation.
So if you wish to build up an in-memory representation, you may do so
using YAJL, but you must bring the code that defines and populates the
in memory structure.

This also means that YAJL can be used by other (higher level) JSON
libraries if so desired.

## YAJL supports stream parsing

This means you do not need to hold the whole JSON representation in
textual form in memory.  This makes YAJL ideal for filtering projects,
where you're converting YAJL from one form to another (i.e. XML).  The
included JSON pretty printer is an example of such a filter program.

## YAJL is fast

Minimal memory copying is performed.  YAJL, when possible, returns
pointers into the client provided text (i.e. for strings that have no
embedded escape chars, hopefully the common case).  I've put a lot of
effort into profiling and tuning performance, but I have ignored a
couple possible performance improvements to keep the interface clean,
small, and flexible.  My hope is that YAJL will perform comparably to
the fastest JSON parser out there.

YAJL should impose both minimal CPU and memory requirements on your
application.

## YAJL is tiny.

Fat free.  No whip.

enjoy,
Lloyd - July, 2007

| 3. crash input: "{"@\\n\\""  It is slightly ambiguous whether the leading and trailing quotes here were intended to be part of the example JSON document. AFAICT though, to get the same set of *three* LeakSanitizer reports, requires *omitting* the leading/trailing quotes. i.e. parsing this document:  ``` {"@\\\n\\\\"  ```  And these three leaks were actually fixed by a much older commit: [openEuler-BaseService@3d65cb0c](https://github.com/openEuler-BaseService/yajl/commit/3d65cb0c6db4d433e5e42ee7d91d8a04e21337cf)  If you include the trailing and leading quotes, asking it to parse this document:  ``` "{"@\\\n\\\\""  ```  Then you only get *two* different leaks:  ``` ==642532==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks  Direct leak of 40 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:     #0 0x7fa2aa2d92ff in malloc (/lib64/libasan.so.8+0xd92ff) (BuildId: dc689b05ca2577037af24700212bb5cce1f91c8a)     #1 0x403b5c in value_alloc /home/berrange/src/external/yajl/src/yajl_tree.c:63     #2 0x403b5c in handle_string /home/berrange/src/external/yajl/src/yajl_tree.c:276  Indirect leak of 2 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:     #0 0x7fa2aa2d92ff in malloc (/lib64/libasan.so.8+0xd92ff) (BuildId: dc689b05ca2577037af24700212bb5cce1f91c8a)     #1 0x403ba1 in handle_string /home/berrange/src/external/yajl/src/yajl_tree.c:280  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: 42 byte(s) leaked in 2 allocation(s).  ```  and they are indeed fixed by this newer commit:  please refer to: [openEuler-BaseService@23a122e](https://github.com/openEuler-BaseService/yajl/commit/23a122eddaa28165a6c219000adcc31ff9a8a698)  IOW, anyone patching a vanilla lloyd yajl 2.1.0 needs to pull both commits  [openEuler-BaseService@23a122e](https://github.com/openEuler-BaseService/yajl/commit/23a122eddaa28165a6c219000adcc31ff9a8a698) [openEuler-BaseService@3d65cb0c](https://github.com/openEuler-BaseService/yajl/commit/3d65cb0c6db4d433e5e42ee7d91d8a04e21337cf) |

| [@NotmebutWind](https://github.com/NotmebutWind) [@berrange](https://github.com/berrange) I'm not cmake expert, and I tried to add the following lines into CMakeLists.txt then compile it, but it doesn't work for me, I also tried to use gcc or clang directly[1][2], but it always raised undefined reference, the yajl\_tree.h indeed exists under the build/yajl-2.1.1/include/yajl/ and /usr/include/yajl/, so I think my testing must be wrong, please correct me, it will be better if your guys can share your configuration of the CMakeLists.txt, thank you so much!  ``` SET(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "Debug") SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG "$ENV{CXXFLAGS} -O0 -Wall -g -Wno-attributes") set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11) set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer")  ```  [1]  ``` [root@sweetpig-21 yajl]# ls build/yajl-2.1.1/include/yajl/ yajl_common.h  yajl_gen.h  yajl_parse.h  yajl_tree.h  yajl_version.h [root@sweetpig-21 yajl]# ls /usr/include/yajl/ yajl_common.h  yajl_gen.h  yajl_parse.h  yajl_tree.h  yajl_version.h [root@sweetpig-21 yajl]# rpm -qf /usr/include/yajl/ yajl-devel-2.1.0-22.el9.x86_64 [root@sweetpig-21 yajl]# pwd /root/yajl [root@sweetpig-21 yajl]# git log -1 commit 5e3a7856e643b4d6410ddc3f84bc2f38174f2872 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge: 12ee82a a30c6f7 Author: Lloyd Hilaiel <lloyd@hilaiel.com> Date:   Thu Sep 24 13:16:46 2015 -0600      Merge pull request #157 from setempler/bugfix-configure          Fixed configure script to accept "-h" and "--prefix".

| CMake is the worst abomination, perhaps ever, in the software world, and certainly in the software configuration and construction sphere.  Try my "fork" using BSD Make to build and test:  <https://github.com/robohack/yajl>  I've already fixed this problem, and I'll be making a new release in the next week or so. |

| That's not the right way to run `parse_config`. It only reads input from standard input and ignores all its command-line parameters. In the way you've run it the program is waiting for you to type the input to it. You can echo the input to it on a pipeline, or redirect it's input from a file.  The regression tests run by `bmake regress` will do that test (in the `example` subdirectory). Not with the exact same input, but exercising what was the same bug. |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-0b0bb84049
2023-07-21 02:25:07.834330
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : R-jsonlite
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 1.8.5
Release : 2.fc38
URL : [https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=jsonlite](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package%3Djsonlite)
Summary : A Simple and Robust JSON Parser and Generator for R
Description :
A reasonably fast JSON parser and generator, optimized for statistical data and
the web. Offers simple, flexible tools for working with JSON in R, and is
particularly powerful for building pipelines and interacting with a web API.
The implementation is based on the mapping described in the vignette (Ooms,
2014). In addition to converting JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite'
contains functions to stream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests
included with the package verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded
consistently for use with dynamic data in systems and applications.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3492-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : yajl
Version        : 2.1.0-3+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-16516 CVE-2022-24795 CVE-2023-33460
Debian Bug     : 1040036

Multiple vulnerabilties have been found in yajl, a JSON parser / small
validating JSON generator# written in ANSI C, which potentially can
cause memory corruption or DoS.

The CVE-20117-16516 had been addressed already in DLA-3478, however the
fix has been found to be incomplete as it missed an additional memory
leak.  This update fixes that problem.

CVE-2017-16516

  When a crafted JSON file is supplied to yajl, the process might
  crash with a SIGABRT in the yajl_string_decode function in
  yajl_encode.c. This results potentially in a denial of service.

CVE-2022-24795

  The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer
  overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing
  with large (~2GB) inputs.

CVE-2023-33460

  There's a memory leak in yajl 2.1.0 with use of yajl_tree_parse
  function, which potentially cause out-of-memory in server and cause
  crash.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.1.0-3+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your yajl packages.

For the detailed security status of yajl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/yajl>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio.

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.
