The provided content is related to CVE-2023-33362.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `profile` function of Piwigo. The `user_id` parameter, received via the URL, is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query within the `getuserdata()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to sanitize user-provided input (`user_id` parameter), allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete data in the database.
- The attacker can use the SQL injection to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL parameter `user_id` passed to the `profile` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application (Piwigo)
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter `user_id`
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement for exploitation from the provided information.
