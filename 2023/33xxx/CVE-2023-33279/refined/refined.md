- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of multiple SQL parameters. Specifically, a sensitive SQL call can be executed with a trivial HTTP call, which can be exploited to forge a blind SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Technical and personal data leaks
    - Obtain admin access
    - Remove all data of the linked PrestaShop
    - Display sensitive tables to front-office, potentially unlocking adminâ€™s ajax scripts of modules protected by token.
- **Attack vectors**: Network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction. The attack can be performed remotely.
