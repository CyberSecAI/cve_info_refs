DETAILED DESCRIPTION

◼ CVE-2023-33217: Missing integrity check on upgrade package
Severity
Base score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H - 7.5 -HIGH

                      November 2023

1/4

Alternative score:  if you have kept the default Enforced Security mode or enabled the mTLS to identify the origin of the
command  issued to the terminal then the severity becomes CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N  - 4.9 -
MEDIUM
Description
By abusing a design flaw in the firmware upgrade mechanism of the impacted terminal it's possible to cause a permanent
denial of service for the terminal. the only way to recover the terminal is by sending back the terminal to the manufacturer.

◼ CVE-2023-33218: Stack Buffer Overflow in a binary run at upgrade startup
Severity
Base score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N - 9.1 - CRITICAL

Alternative score:  if you have kept the default Enforced Security mode or enabled the mTLS to identify the origin of the
command  issued to the terminal then the severity becomes CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N  - 6.5 -
MEDIUM

Description
The Parameter Zone Read and Parameter Zone Write command handlers allow performing a Stack  buffer overflow.
This could potentially lead to a Remote Code execution on the targeted device.

◼ CVE-2023-33219: Stack Buffer Overflow when checking retrofit package
Severity
Base score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N - 9.1 - CRITICAL

Alternative score:  if you have kept the default Enforced Security mode or enabled the mTLS to identify the origin of the
command  issued to the terminal then the severity becomes CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N  - 6.5 -
MEDIUM

Description
The handler of the retrofit validation command doesn't properly check the boundaries when performing certain validation
operations.  This  allows  a  stack-based  buffer  overflow  that  could  lead  to  a  potential  Remote  Code  Execution  on  the
targeted device.

◼ CVE-2023-33220: Stack Buffer Overflow when checking some attributes during retrofit
Severity
Base score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N - 9.1 - CRITICAL

Alternative score:  if you have kept the default Enforced Security mode or enabled the mTLS to identify the origin of the
command  issued to the terminal then the severity becomes CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N  - 6.5 -
MEDIUM

Description
During the retrofit validation process, the firmware doesn't properly check the boundaries while copying some attributes
to check. This allows a stack-based buffer overflow that could lead to a potential Remote Code Execution on the targeted
device.

◼ Heap Buffer Overflow when reading DESFire card - CVE-2023-33221:
Severity
Base score: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H - 7.8 - HIGH

Description
When  reading  DesFire  keys,  the  function  that  reads  the  card  isn't  properly  checking  the  boundaries  when  copying
internally  the  data  received.  This  allows  a  heap  based  buffer  overflow  that  could  lead  to  a  potential  Remote  Code
Execution on the targeted device. This is especially problematic if you use Default DESFire key.

◼ Stack buffer overflow when reading DESFire card - CVE-2023-33222:
Severity
Base score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N - 9.1 - CRITICAL

Description
When handling contactless cards, usage of a specific function to get additional information from the card which doesn't
check the boundary on the data received while reading. This allows a stack-based buffer overflow that could lead to a
potential Remote Code Execution on the targeted device.

CAUSE

The vulnerabilities arise from lack of boundaries check when manipulating buffers, or improper check of firmware update
file structure.

RESOLUTION

Update your device firmware to the non-vulnerable version:

Product

SIGMA Lite & Lite+

SIGMA Wide

SIGMA Extreme

MorphoWave Compact/XP

VisionPass

MorphoWave SP

WORKAROUND

Non vulnerable versions

Firmware 4.15.5 or higher

Firmware 2.12.2 or higher

Firmware 1.2.7 or higher

•  For all described vulnerabilities except CVE-2023-33222: activate mTLS on the device by following your user

manual to prevent arbitrary source from issuing thrift command

•  For CVE-2023-33221, CVE-2023-33222: ensure your device uses diversified DESFire keys

•  For  CVE-2023-33222:  there  is  no  workaround,  although  the  attacker  needs  to  have  physical  access  to  the

device

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

We would like to thank Lucas Georges from Synacktiv for helping identify those vulnerabilities.
