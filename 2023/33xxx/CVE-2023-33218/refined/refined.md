- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow exists in a binary that runs during the upgrade startup process. This is due to a lack of proper boundary checks in the Parameter Zone Read and Parameter Zone Write command handlers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential remote code execution on the targeted device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted Parameter Zone Read or Parameter Zone Write command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned, but it can be triggered remotely, and if default security mode is not enabled, the attacker can potentially exploit the device without prior access. If the default Enforced Security mode or mTLS is enabled, the attacker needs privileged access (PR:H).
