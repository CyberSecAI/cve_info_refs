    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"

     "attack_vectors": [
        "An authenticated malicious user inserts a malicious payload (e.g., `<img src=1 onerror='alert(document.cookie)'/>`) into the 'Name' field when creating a contact role.",
        "When a user views or interacts with content displaying the contact role (e.g., editing a contact assignment), the stored XSS payload is triggered in their browser."
