- **Root cause:** Insufficient input filtering in the "data-original-title" Bootstrap popover attribute. The application does not sanitize the user-supplied first and last name fields, which are then rendered as innerHTML when a hover event triggers a Bootstrap popover.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a backend user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker submits a malicious casting application with an XSS payload in the first or last name fields. When a backend user views the submitted casting applications and hovers over the "Kontakt" button, the XSS payload is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to submit casting applications. No special privileges or access are required beyond this. The backend user only needs to view the detail of the application, and hover over a specific button.
