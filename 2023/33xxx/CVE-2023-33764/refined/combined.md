# eMedia Consulting simpleRedak - Stored Cross-Site Scripting

A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the casting backend (/#/de/casting/show/detail/).

The vulnerability was reported as CVE-2023-33764.

**Versions affected: simpleRedak <= 2.47.23.05**

## Background

An attacker may submit a malicious casting application that contains an XSS payload in the first or last name fields. Once a backend user opens the detail view of the submitted casting applications, hovering over a Bootstrap popover component results in XSS.

## Steps to Reproduce

[![Figure 1: Submitting an exemplary application with a malicious last name](/rauschecker/CVEs/raw/main/CVE-2023-33764/33764_1.png "Figure 1: Submitting an exemplary application with a malicious last name")](/rauschecker/CVEs/blob/main/CVE-2023-33764/33764_1.png)

Figure 1: Submitting an exemplary application with a malicious last name

For the proof-of-concept screenshots we have used the following payload:

```
Test <img src=a onerror=alert(1111)>

```

Once the user in the backend hovers over the "Kontakt" button, a Bootstrap popover is created. Should the next profile be the profile with our malicious name, the XSS payload is executed:

[![Figure 2: Hovering over the Kontakt button results in XSS via a Bootstrap popover event](/rauschecker/CVEs/raw/main/CVE-2023-33764/33764_2.png "Figure 2: Hovering over the Kontakt button results in XSS via a Bootstrap popover event")](/rauschecker/CVEs/blob/main/CVE-2023-33764/33764_2.png)

Figure 2: Hovering over the Kontakt button results in XSS via a Bootstrap popover event

## Root Cause

This issue exists due to insufficient input filtering in the "data-original-title" Bootstrap popover attribute. No adequate sanitization is performed and the malicious name is rendered as an innerHTML assignment when the hover-Event fires:

[![Figure 3: Root cause: Hover event creates a Bootstrap popover that includes malicious HTML](/rauschecker/CVEs/raw/main/CVE-2023-33764/33764_3.png "Figure 3: Root cause: Hover event creates a Bootstrap popover that includes malicious HTML")](/rauschecker/CVEs/blob/main/CVE-2023-33764/33764_3.png)

## Fix

All software versions up to and including version 2.47.23.05 are affected. The vendor was informed of the finding on May 5, 2023. The vulnerability is fixed with version 2.47.23.06.
