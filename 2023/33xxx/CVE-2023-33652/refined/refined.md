The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Sitecore 9.3, including:

**1. IIS Authorization Bypass to RCE:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `Sitecore.Mvc.DeviceSimulator.Controllers.SimulatorController` exposes an action named `Preview` that takes a `previewPath` parameter. This parameter is then used in a call to `Server.Execute`, which redirects execution to the specified path *without* re-running the entire HTTP pipeline. This allows bypassing most IIS-level authorization controls.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Uncontrolled `Server.Execute` call allows redirecting execution to any file in the webroot.
    *   Lack of input validation on `previewPath`.
    *   Ability to access configuration backups due to predictable file names.
    *   Exploitation of the Telerik UI deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-18935) through leaked configuration (Web.config).
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) by leveraging a vulnerable Telerik component, after obtaining configuration from web.config file.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1.  Send a request to `/api/sitecore/Sitecore.Mvc.DeviceSimulator.Controllers.SimulatorController,Sitecore.Mvc.DeviceSimulator.dll/Preview` with the `previewPath` parameter set to a file within the webroot (e.g., `/App_Data/license.xml` or a config backup).
    2.  Retrieve a configuration backup (e.g. `web.config`) by iterating through potential backup file names.
    3.  Use Telerik deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-18935) to achieve remote code execution using leaked keys from the web.config file
*  **Required Capabilities:** Unauthenticated access to the application. The attacker needs to identify and locate config files, and exploit the Telerik deserialization vulnerability

**2. Unsafe Reflection:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `/sitecore/shell/Invoke.aspx` page allows authenticated users to instantiate arbitrary classes and execute instance methods with string parameters by calling `ReflectionUtil.CallMethod`
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Ability to instantiate arbitrary classes using user-controlled input.
    *   Ability to execute instance methods on instantiated classes with user-controlled string parameters.
    *   Usage of `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize` within `PivotGridFilterPersistenceHelper.DeserializeObject`, which can be triggered via a property setter on `Telerik.Web.UI.RadPivotGrid`.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) via insecure deserialization.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1.  Send a POST request to `/sitecore/shell/Invoke.aspx` with the `__OBJECT` parameter set to `Telerik.Web.UI.RadPivotGrid.set_FiltersPersistence("PivotGridReportFilter;x;[ysoserial payload]")`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Requires authenticated access to the application.

**3. Authorization Bypass Two: EXM Boogaloo**

*   **Root Cause:** The EXM component sets the `HttpContext.User` to a configured `Renderer User` if valid `ec_message_id` and `ec_id` query parameters are provided. This bypasses authentication checks when accessing restricted pages.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Setting `HttpContext.User` based on controllable query parameters.
    *   Lack of verification on EXM parameters, allowing an unauthenticated user to impersonate the Renderer User.
    *   Abuse of the `Server.Execute` vulnerability to access `/sitecore/shell/Invoke.aspx` using the context of the renderer user.
*   **Impact:** Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) by combining the EXM authentication bypass with the unsafe reflection vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1.  Obtain valid `ec_message_id` and `ec_id` parameters.
    2.  Send a request to `/api/sitecore/Sitecore.Mvc.DeviceSimulator.Controllers.SimulatorController,Sitecore.Mvc.DeviceSimulator.dll/Preview` including `ec_message_id`, `ec_id`, and `previewPath=/sitecore/shell/Invoke.aspx`.
    3.  Include the `__OBJECT` parameter containing the deserialization payload.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid `ec_message_id` and `ec_id` from emails generated by EXM.

**4. Bonus Authenticated RCE**

*  **Root Cause**: The `Sitecore.Pipelines.ConvertToRuntimeHtml.ConvertWebControls` pipeline processor uses `Base64ToObject` to deserialize a value from the `value` attribute of an HTML node that was created using the class `scInlineControl`.
*   **Vulnerabilities**: Unsafe deserialization using `BinaryFormatter` on base64 encoded data provided in a HTML document.
*  **Impact**: Remote Code execution for authenticated users.
*  **Attack Vectors**:
    1.  Send a POST request to `/sitecore/shell/Applications/Content%20Manager/Execute.aspx?cmd=convert&mode=HTML` with a HTML payload that includes an `scInlineControl` and its corresponding `_inner` element containing a ysoserial payload in the `value` attribute
*   **Required Capabilities:** Authenticated access to the application.
