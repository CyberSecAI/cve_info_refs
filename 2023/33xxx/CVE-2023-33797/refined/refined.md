{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new site, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to full compromise of the user's session and data. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal cookies, or redirect the user to malicious sites.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the 'Name' field when creating a new site. This payload is then stored in the system and executed when the site is displayed, for example when adding a rack.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Netbox application to create a new site and inject the malicious payload."
