The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Netbox version 3.5.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization in the "Create Rack Roles" function within the "Organization" feature. Specifically, the "Name" field allows for the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious script is stored in the database and executed when a user accesses the affected functionality.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input in the "Name" field when creating a new rack role.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to:
- Session hijacking: stealing session cookies.
- Defacement: modifying the displayed content of the web page.
- Phishing attacks: redirecting users to a malicious page or performing actions on the user's behalf.
- Full account compromise: if the victim has elevated privileges, the attacker could gain full control of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects a malicious payload (e.g., `<img src=1 onerror='alert(document.cookie)'/>`) into the "Name" field when creating a rack role via `/dcim/rack-roles/`.
- The stored payload is triggered when a user views the rack role by going to `/dcim/racks/` and selecting a role.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated access to the Netbox application.
- Ability to create rack roles within the "Organization" feature.
