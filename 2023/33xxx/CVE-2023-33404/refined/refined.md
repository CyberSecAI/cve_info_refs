Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and a hardcoded file upload path in BlogEngine.NET CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users with "EditOwnPosts" rights to upload files to a specific location without proper validation on the file type or content.
*   **Hardcoded File Path:** The application saves uploaded files to a hardcoded path, making it predictable and exploitable.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** While the application checks for "EditOwnPosts" rights, this level of authorization is not sufficient to prevent the upload of malicious files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious file (e.g., a web shell), an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a POST request to the `/api/upload` endpoint with the parameter `action=video`.
*   **File Upload:** The attacker includes a malicious file in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have a user account with the "EditOwnPosts" right on the BlogEngine.NET CMS.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in BlogEngine.NET CMS version 3.3.8.0 and earlier.
*   The application first verifies if a user has `EditOwnPosts` permissions before processing the file upload request.
*   The application uses a function called `UploadVideo` which saves the file to a hardcoded directory after performing a check to see if the target directory exists.
*   The hardcoded location of uploaded file allows the attacker to request and execute it, resulting in RCE
