# Stored XSS in the Task External Link Functionality

Moderate

[fguillot](/fguillot)
published
GHSA-8qvf-9847-gpc9
Jun 3, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 1.2.29

## Patched versions

1.2.30

## Description

### Summary

A **stored XSS** allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript and any user who views the task containing the malicious code will be exposed to the **XSS** attack.

**Note**: The default CSP **blocks** the javascript attack, tho it can be exploited if an instance is badly configured and at the moment it's vulnerable to **CSS injection** because of the **unsafe-inline** on the default CSP so I think that would be also good to take a look into that and maybe remove that flag from the default **CSP**.

### Details

The stored XSS vulnerability is present in the file `/app/Template/task_external_link/table.php`, on **line 32**.

The input variable `$link['url']` is not properly escaped with the `e` function, unlike the other variables used in the same context.

```
<a href="<?= $link['url'] ?>" title="<?= $this->text->e($link['url']) ?>"
target="_blank"><?= $this->text->e($link['title']) ?><span class="ui-helper-
hidden-accessible"> (<?= $this->text->e($link['url']) ?>)</span></a>
```
### PoC

1. Create a task in any project you wish
2. Create a **external link** of any type ( for example, **auto** ) and then click save
3. Change the **URL** value again, insert the following payload `"><meta http-equiv="refresh" content="2;url=http://example.com/" />` and you got now a **Stored XSS** in that task.

stored\_xss\_kanboard.mp4

### Impact

The **stored XSS** allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript in any user context when the malicious task is viewed by a user which also can lead to the attacker escalating his privileges within the software if a "Administrator" views the task containing the malicious code.

This would also mean massive exploitation because combined with the **Broken Access Control Vulnerability** reported before, an attacker can spray a malicious task containing the **XSS** payload into any project (personal or not) and just wait for anyone who uses the software to view it.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
