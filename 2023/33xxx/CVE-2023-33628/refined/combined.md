## Vulnerability Description
H3C Magic R300-2100M firmware version R300-2100MV100R004 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the DelvsList interface at /goform/aspForm.

In line 28, the maximum size in the getElement function is limited to 64. When the length of input less than 64, the string will be copied into a1 by memcpy function. The size of the original array has been completely exceeded, resulting in a buffer overflow vulnerability.
