The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input, specifically when setting the logo or other image's file\_url, which allows for JavaScript code injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can maintain permissions and steal credentials.
- Malicious JavaScript code execution in the context of the application, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- By manipulating the file\_url field of a logo or other images.
- By submitting a request with malicious JavaScript code in the file\_url field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the logo or other image's file\_url within the Dcat Admin application. This likely requires a valid user account with sufficient privileges within the Dcat Admin system.
