Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper neutralization of multiple SQL parameters in the `scexportcustomers` module for PrestaShop, which allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): The module is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to unsanitized user input being directly used in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- Technical and personal data leaks
- Potential for gaining administrative access
- Ability to remove all data from the linked PrestaShop instance
- Displaying sensitive tables on the front-office, potentially exposing admin ajax scripts of modules protected by tokens.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via a simple HTTP call.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific privileges or user interaction is needed to exploit the vulnerability. An anonymous user can execute the attack.

**Additional notes:**
- The module was patched in version 3.6.2, and versions up to 3.6.1 are vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is considered critical with a CVSS score of 9.8.
- The advisory mentions that updating PrestaShop disables multiquery executions but does not protect against SQL injection using the UNION clause.
- The advisory highlights the importance of using the `pSQL` function in PrestaShop to prevent Stored XSS vulnerabilities.
