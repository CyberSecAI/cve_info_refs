The provided content is related to CVE-2023-33786.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Create Circuit Types" function in Netbox 3.5.1.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that malicious code injected by a user is stored on the server and executed when other users view the affected data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, they can fully compromise that user. This can lead to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves an authenticated malicious user navigating to the `/circuits/circuit-types/` page, clicking "Add", and inserting a malicious payload such as `<img src=1 onerror='alert(document.cookie)'/>` into the "Name" field. The payload is stored in the system. Later when an admin user views the stored payload when creating a circuit, the script will execute in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create circuit types in Netbox.
