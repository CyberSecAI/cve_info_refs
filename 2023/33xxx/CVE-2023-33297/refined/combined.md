# bitdrain - bitcoin cpu/mem dos/crash and $ attack

remote p2p cpu/mem and upstream financial attack against bitcoin, dogecoin, etc.

github issue [dogecoin/dogecoin#3243](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/3243)

by using `drain-doge.py`, `drain-btc.py` and `drain-ltc.py` we can force dogecoin/bitcoin/litecoin/fork nodes to upload unlimited data to an attacking machine - which caps out, throttles and in many cases charges overuse fees on upstream - making this a financial attack against bitcoin and its forks. certain protocol messages aren't rate limited and can be used to remotely overwhelm a server's upstream in a financially damaging way.

# dogecoin issue report

there is a remote attack that can be carried out in perpetuity against vulnerable nodes in a way that a single attacking machine can force `dogecoind` to upload > 130MB/s to the attacking machine in a sustained way.

doge nodes on isps or cloud providers that charge for or throttle upstream after a cap has been reached are, unless hardened against this attack at a server level, vulnerable to the attack.

i did some testing and ran my digitalocean bandwidth costs to > $175 relatively quickly.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38997186/229753562-079d844f-8b82-4d23-9fd8-56fc6bcca3d7.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38997186/229753562-079d844f-8b82-4d23-9fd8-56fc6bcca3d7.png)

making this a financial attack against vulnerable nodes - but not an attack capable of taking the network offline.

the attack is carried out by an [evil multithreaded script](https://github.com/visualbasic6/drain) that pretends to be several valid nodes. this is accomplished by operating in the network at a low p2p protocol level. after performing a complete handshake with the target node, resulting in a healthy peer connection, the script begins to request protocol message content in a loop. at this point a single attacking machine can trigger, again, `dogecoind` into sending > 130MB/s worth of data. additionally - with code alterations it is likely that the evil script could target multiple dogecoin nodes simultaneously, from one machine, assuming that certain conditions are met on the attacker's end.

i can't find a bug bounty program so i'm just posting it here. it's not really the exploit of the century so i'm not concerned with evil actors carrying out bandwidth attacks against their enemies. that said - still - [get that fixed](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BU3tDES29sY&t=143s).

bitcoin and litecoin are also vulnerable to the attack.

but blockstream (skids) and their approved programmers (skids) are ants at a picnic when it comes to irresponsible public disclosure. i'd like to think that, at least here in the doge community, we like to have a bit of fun and [do a little trolling](https://youtu.be/PobQzVsj7GE?t=4).

thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

### Is there an existing issue for this?

* I have searched the existing issues

### Current behaviour

We are the technical team from AntPool. We found that when the Bitcoin wallet node processes the process message recently, the single-threaded CPU 100% causes block parsing delays, resulting in serious technical failures.

Our version number is the latest version 24.0.1。

Not only antpool, we also asked other mining pools and found this problem. This will lead to increasingly serious orphan blocks and forks.

### Expected behaviour

Run ProcessMessage with multiple threads to reduce the performance problem of CPU single-thread ProcessMessage.

Or are there other configurations that can alleviate this problem?

### Steps to reproduce

Run the wallet, synchronize to the latest height, and then observe the CPU usage. You can see that there is a single-core CPU usage that remains at 100% for a long time

### Relevant log output

*No response*

### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core

Pre-built binaries

### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?

v24.0.1

### Operating system and version

Ubuntu 22.04 LTC

### @ajtowns **[ajtowns](/ajtowns)** commented [May 10, 2023](#issue-1702906330)

Couple of performance improvements when draining the inventory-to-send queue:

* drop txs that have already been evicted from the mempool (or included in a block) immediately, rather than at the end of processing
* marginally increase outgoing trickle rate during spikes in tx volume

Sorry, something went wrong.

If transactions are being added to the mempool at a rate faster than 7tx/s

become relatively large. If this happens, increase the number of txids
we include in an INV message (normally capped at 35) by 5 for each 1000
txids in the queue.

This will tend to clear a temporary excess out reasonably quickly; an
excess of 4000 invs to send will be cleared down to 1000 in about 30

Could this increase the number of transactions we're announcing beyond `INVENTORY_MAX_RECENT_RELAY = 3500` so things fall out of `m_recently_announced_invs` (essentially what you said in [#27602 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27602#discussion_r1189250200))?

Maybe we want to increase `INVENTORY_MAX_RECENT_RELAY`, e.g. equal to `MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS = 5000` (the max requesting coming from the receiver end if they're Bitcoin Core - imo it could make sense for these to be symmetrical)?

The `3500` figure is calculated based on outbound peers, which already have 2.5x the INV rate of inbound peers. An inbound peer would need to be at 65 or 70 txids per INV message to have the same 1-in-a-million chance of a problem, implying a tx rate of 13 or 14 tx/s. To get to a 1-in-100 chance of a problem, you'd need to hit 90-to-95 txids per INV (and sustain that for ~40 INVs, and hit the 1-in-100 chance of sending those 40 INVs in a 2 minute period). Those seem okay to me.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Note to others: we may send outbound peers 7 \* 2.5 \* 60 \* 2 ~= 2100 transaction ids per 2 minutes. Depending on random variation it can be more. `UNCONDITIONAL_RELAY_DELAY = 2min;` is the period of time that we have to remember what we sent to a specific peer. For privacy reason we don't want to reveal these transactions to *other* (spy) peers yet. We do this tracking with a bloom filter `m_recently_announced_invs` that has a 1 in a million chance of messing up. I forgot if it's false positive (we give the spy a transaction we shouldn't have) or negative (we deny them a transaction we just announced).

Now my question:

This change increases the max rate for outbound rate too, so I'm still confused why we don't have to increase the `3500`. This PR increases the maximum rate to outbound peers from 7 \* 2.5 = 17.5 tx/s to 1000 / 2 = 500 tx/s (in theory, presumably not in practice), so a 4 second burst would fill it up.

From [below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27610/commits/5b3406094f2679dfb3763de4414257268565b943#r1190574243):

> (Could make sense to limit it to 90 for inbounds and 45 for outbounds as (if sustained for two minutes) those values would hit roughly a 1-in-100 chance of overflowing `INVENTORY_MAX_RECENT_RELAY`)

That would make more sense to me as well, plus:

Why stop at 1000? If it's the same rationale could you use this constant?

It's more related to `MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS=5000` (we don't want to send more than we would be willing to receive) and `INVENTORY_MAX_RECENT_RELAY=3500` (we don't want to advertise txids and then refuse to relay them because we've forgotten that we advertised them).

`[net_processing: Boost inv trickle rate](/fanquake/bitcoin/commit/128da6e41fc2acc5bd1f4e2bddf2953f2fa62a68 "net_processing: Boost inv trickle rate

If transactions are being added to the mempool at a rate faster than 7tx/s
(INVENTORY_BROADCAST_PER_SECOND) then peers' inventory_to_send queue can
become relatively large. If this happens, increase the number of txids
we include in an INV message (normally capped at 35) by 5 for each 1000
txids in the queue.

This will tend to clear a temporary excess out reasonably quickly; an
excess of 4000 invs to send will be cleared down to 1000 in about 30
minutes, while an excess of 20000 invs would be cleared down to 1000 in
about 60 minutes.

If transactions are being added to the mempool at a rate faster than 7tx/s
(INVENTORY_BROADCAST_PER_SECOND) then peers' inventory_to_send queue can
become relatively large. If this happens, increase the number of txids
we include in an INV message (normally capped at 35) by 5 for each 1000
txids in the queue.

This will tend to clear a temporary excess out reasonably quickly; an
excess of 4000 invs to send will be cleared down to 1000 in about 30
minutes, while an excess of 20000 invs would be cleared down to 1000 in
about 60 minutes.

question (feel free to ignore): I tried to figure out if there was a reason why this was re-ordered, but couldn't find one. An equivalent patch of simply changing the literals `false` to `true` and `true` to `false` in this function should have achieved the same, right?

The `CompareTxMemPoolEntryByScore` comparator returns `false` on equality (ie, it's "less than" not "less than or equal"), so this preserves that behaviour.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Thanks, I should have just read the documentation: <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Compare> , which would have answered this.

Post-Merge ACK.

I've been running this patch (plus added reporting in `getpeerinfo`, [mzumsande@6932997](https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/commit/6932997b1b41d2197094a0a9c71601df72630501)) for a few days, and have neither seen extremely high backlogs > 5000 in `m_tx_inventory_to_send` nor enhanced CPU use.

In order to better monitor the efficacy of this, it might make sense to expose the size of `m_tx_inventory_to_send` via RPC permanently?

Sorry, something went wrong.

For a followup it would be could to clarify "should be considered" *for what*. It's somewhat confusing to reason about because the call site reverses a and b.

The first case in the comment is "a is not in the mempool, but b is", but the line of code checks if b is not in the mempool.

Sorry, something went wrong.

> The first case in the comment is "a is not in the mempool, but b is", but the line of code checks if b is not in the mempool.

If b is not in the mempool, the function must return false, see [#27610 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27610#discussion_r1191235815)

If b is in the mempool, the function will continue over the early return `false`, and checks to see if a is missing, in which case it should be considered sooner.

> "should be considered" for what

For processing, which begins by dropping a transaction from `m_tx_inventory_to_send` before deciding whether to send it. Since we stop processing after having sent `broadcast_max` transactions, it makes sense to do the cleaning first.

A return value of `true` means hasha is lower, i.e. would be at the bottom of the (max)heap and processed last. But because we swap a and b when calling this, it works. That was introduced in the second commit of [#7840](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7840).

We could prune non-mempool transactions even before making a heap, but that would double the mempool lookups, and the [flame graph](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27610#issuecomment-1542339344) suggests that `make_heap` is plenty fast already now.

Sorry, something went wrong.

It was about that high running v24 release but dropped to 30% or so when I first switched to this branch and restarted.  [@pinheadmz](https://github.com/pinheadmz) I've been running the patch on multiple nodes for a week now and haven't seen 100% CPU usage in the b-msghand thread again. If you haven't restarted or if it happens again, it would be helpful to see which functions are slow. `perf top -p $(pidof bitcoind)` should do the trick. |

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One caused bitcoin to crash on some machines when processing a transaction containing an OP\_LSHIFT. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

After these bugs were discovered, many currently-unused script words were disabled for safety.

On July 29 2010, it was discovered that block [71036](http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000997f9fd2fe1ee376293ef8c42ad09193a5d2086dddf8e5c426b56) contained several transactions with a ton of OP\_CHECKSIG commands. There should only ever be one such command. This caused every node to do extra unnecessary work, and it could have been used as a denial-of-service attack. A new version of Bitcoin was quickly released. The new version did not cause a fork on the main network, though it did cause one on the test network (where someone had played around with the attack more).

On August 15 2010, it was [discovered](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0) that block 74638 contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins for two different addresses. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed. A new version was published within a few hours of the discovery. The block chain had to be forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the "bad" block chain, the "good" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691. The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain.

The block and transaction:

## CVE-2010-5140

Summary: Never confirming transactions
Fix Deployment: 100%

```

| bitcoindwxBitcoin | \* - 0.3.12 | 0.3.13 |

Around September 29, 2010, people started [reporting](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.0) that their sent transactions would not confirm. This happened because people modified Bitcoin to send sub-0.01 transactions without any fees. A 0.01 fee was at that time required by the network for such transactions (essentially prohibiting them), so the transactions remained at 0 confirmations forever. This became a more serious issue because Bitcoin would send transactions using bitcoins gotten from transactions with 0 confirmations, and these resulting transactions would also never confirm. Because Bitcoin tends to prefer sending smaller coins, these invalid transactions quickly multiplied, contaminating the wallets of everyone who received them.

Bitcoin was changed to only select coins with at least 1 confirmation. The remaining sub-0.01 transactions were cleared by generators who modified their version of Bitcoin to not require the micropayment fee. It took a while for everything to get cleared, though, because many of the intermediate transactions had been forgotten by the network by this point and had to be rebroadcast by the original senders.

Block hash collisions can easily be made by duplicating transactions in the merkle tree.
Such a collision is invalid, but if recorded (as Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind prior to 0.6.1 did) would prevent acceptance of the legitimate block with the same hash.
This could be used to fork the blockchain, including deep double-spend attacks.

| hi,  there is a remote attack that can be carried out in perpetuity against vulnerable nodes in a way that a single attacking machine can force `dogecoind` to upload > 130MB/s to the attacking machine in a sustained way.  doge nodes on isps or cloud providers that charge for or throttle upstream after a cap has been reached are, unless hardened against this attack at a server level, vulnerable to the attack.  i did some testing and ran my digitalocean bandwidth costs to > $175 relatively quickly.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38997186/229753562-079d844f-8b82-4d23-9fd8-56fc6bcca3d7.png)  making this a financial attack against vulnerable nodes - but not an attack capable of taking the network offline.  the attack is carried out by an [evil multithreaded script](https://github.com/visualbasic6/drain) that pretends to be several valid nodes. this is accomplished by operating in the network at a low p2p protocol level. after performing a complete handshake with the target node, resulting in a healthy peer connection, the script begins to request protocol message content in a loop. at this point a single attacking machine can trigger, again, `dogecoind` into sending > 130MB/s worth of data. additionally - with code alterations it is likely that the evil script could target multiple dogecoin nodes simultaneously, from one machine, assuming that certain conditions are met on the attacker's end.  i can't find a bug bounty program so i'm just posting it here. it's not really the exploit of the century so i'm not concerned with evil actors carrying out bandwidth attacks against their enemies. that said - still - [get that fixed](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BU3tDES29sY&t=143s).  bitcoin and litecoin are also vulnerable to the attack.  but blockstream (skids) and their approved programmers (skids) are ants at a picnic when it comes to irresponsible public disclosure. i'd like to think that, at least here in the doge community, we like to have a bit of fun and [do a little trolling](https://youtu.be/PobQzVsj7GE?t=4).  demo:  [asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/577193)  mad <3, [kev](https://twitter.com/123456) (pad) |

| Ok. Eyes on this on my end as well.. In addition to tracking a limit of amount of data sent to a single requesting node, some heuristic trigger which could identify a bogus loop of requests versus legitimate ones. Wouldn't want to implement too harsh of a rate limit that slows the network down as initial synchronization is already a pain point for setting up a new node. But it probably, definitely, needs to happen at least to mitigate the severity. On my radar as well, though. |

| patrick - while i suspect that hammering `mempool` will produce similar (or worse) behavior - i think this issue is associated with `getheaders` returning up to 2000 block headers at once resulting in > 0.15MB responses that aren't rate limited.  <https://github.com/visualbasic6/drain/blob/c8373b55d83832f95fb0a77aca56436adeffb58d/drain-doge.py#L111>  ``` def create_getheaders_payload(num_headers=1999):     version = 77777     num_hashes = 1     start_hash = binascii.unhexlify("82bc68038f6034c0596b6e313729793a887fded6e92a31fbdf70863f89d9bea2")[::-1]     stop_hash = binascii.unhexlify("a4f5e07dfe69ce652866a496a1f15f1fdf1d8d20ab3a6eb6c13aaf6d379ba594")[::-1]     return struct.pack('<L', version) + struct.pack('<B', num_hashes) + start_hash + stop_hash  ``` |

| All this can be protected with `-maxuploadtarget`:  ```   -maxuploadtarget=<n>        Tries to keep outbound traffic under the given target (in MiB per 24h),        0 = no limit (default: 0)  ``` |

| submitted 5 months ago 🤨  is there a sensible patch for this? i've run projections and have clocked a single attacking charging a digitalocean vps running `bitcoind` (interchangeable with `dogecoind` in this case) roughly $3,000USD per month through a victim's node. even running on hetzner which is world renowned for its upstream pricing results in > $300USD per month - making it fiscally impractical to run public listening nodes given that a spam cartel botnet operation could theoretically short the markets and launch a scaled attack against vulnerable swaths of the network. this is actually a critically important exploit to solve. i am not sure if schooling sub-amateur sysadmins to mitigation tactics is the optimal strategy here.  if any of you have found a reasonable fix for this - i would like to hear about it. ideally it is something very simple, like an upcoming default configuration setting or anything else that is generally simplistic. i hope this isn't a giant barrier - because it's a pretty dirty financial attack that could be violently amplified by a formidable [**botnet**](https://youtu.be/O65y6ocniKs?t=70).  wouldn't `-maxuploadtarget` just slow the network down? if the answer is "not really" or "no" - what is the best way to signal boost this to - uh - everyone?  if anyone has any questions i will answer them if i am able to. additionally i can also be privately messaged on [x](https://x.com/123456). i will make myself available.  tl;dr this is potentially a bigger deal than we're thinking and could potentially be used for the purpose of attacking networks for the purpose of shorting markets, as an example. so - as i requested nearly 6 months ago - please roll out a patch for this as soon as possible - and let me know if i can be of assistance whatsoever.  ```                    _             .--,-"" ""-.

| Since per-connection limits are not capable of protecting against DDoS, the only tracking we can effectively do on a trustless p2p network is limiting the overall bytes transmitted.  wouldn't `-maxuploadtarget` just slow the network down?  It may slow down temporarily while nodes try reconnecting to unobstructed peers, and of course the number of useful peer slots will decrease globally when this happens at scale, but with a 16-to-1 in/out ratio, if 1-in-16 nodes is either unmetered or does not have slots to exploit, this should not be a downtime event. Did you find any other issues while [validating this mitigation](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/3243?issuecomment-1523344080#issuecomment-1523344080)?  However, on my fastest (and unmetered) nodes, the most traffic comes from syncing up new nodes; not relaying new transactions and blocks. Even during the 1.5 month of insane transaction spam we saw this year, sync still was the bigger cost in terms of data on these nodes.  if the answer is "not really" or "no" - what is the best way to signal boost this to - uh - everyone?  We should definitely put a reminder in the release notes for 1.14.7. I think that perhaps it would be useful to make a clear instruction in the [getting started guide](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md). Could you give us your best recommendation?  if any of you have found a reasonable fix for this - i would like to hear about it.   1. [Add setmaxuploadtarget RPC command #3255](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/3255) will add hot change capability for `maxuploadtarget` (also needs [Add extra configuration file to persist RPC-set features #3328](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/3328), so there's a bit of a path to it) 2. [[WIP] net: Implement ADDRv2 for TorV3 support #3149](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/3149) will update onion support - this should ultimately allow operators to enable some additional DoS protection features like Tor's new-ish RandomX PoW protection for hidden services. |

## Description

![@ajtowns](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127186?u=547375ac58f0e1938debaf9135787fc644ae9820&v=4&size=48)[ajtowns](https://github.com/ajtowns)opened [on May 6, 2023](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27586#issue-1698374069)

I've been seeing 100% cpu usage on one of my bitcoind nodes recently, with transactions taking >60s to be accepted into the mempool. Digging into it, the problem seems to be `BOOST_MULTI_INDEX_ENABLE_SAFE_MODE` which was introduced in [#24395](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24395). That results in iterator destruction taking O(n) time (in the number of other active iterators on the same multi-index) in the worst case, rather than O(1) time, due to keeping the iterators in a [singly linked list](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/boost/multi_index/detail/safe_mode.hpp):

```
 * Iterators are chained in a single attached list, whose header is
 * kept by the container. More elaborate data structures would yield better
 * performance, but I decided to keep complexity to a minimum since
 * speed is not an issue here.

```

Speed does become an issue here though, as we keep an iterator around for every mempool entry (in `vTxHashes`).

This isn't always a problem: presumably in the normal case new iterators are added to the head of the list then removed while they're still roughly at the head of the list, giving O(1) timing; but somehow having a full mempool (and hence TrimToSize actually doing things) triggers worst case behaviour?

Bitcoin Core version 24.1 is now available from:
 <https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-24.1/>
This release includes various bug fixes and performanceimprovements, as well as updated translations.
Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:
 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues>
To receive security and update notifications, please subscribe to:
 <https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/>
How to Upgrade==============
If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completelyshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run theinstaller (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).
Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL ispossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Oldwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.
Compatibility==============
Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systemsusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer. BitcoinCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not asfrequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core onunsupported systems.
