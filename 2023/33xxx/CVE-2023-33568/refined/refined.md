Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-33568:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `htdocs/public/ticket/ajax/ajax.php` file within Dolibarr versions 16.0.0 to 16.0.4.
*   The `ajax.php` script, intended for handling AJAX requests related to tickets, had insufficient input validation, specifically on the 'email' parameter when the action is 'getContacts'.
*   The script uses a SQL `LIKE` operator with the user-supplied email, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The `ajax.php` file is accessible without authentication, allowing anyone to send requests.
*   **SQL Injection:** The use of the `LIKE` operator in the SQL query with the unfiltered 'email' parameter allows attackers to inject SQL wildcards, specifically the '%' character.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The code fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input, allowing for malicious queries to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract the entire contact database, including customer files, prospects, suppliers, and potentially employee information, by injecting the '%' wildcard in the email parameter.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Along with the contact data, private and public notes associated with contacts can be accessed.
*   **Database Technical Information Disclosure:** The attacker can also access some technical data about the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `ajax.php` file.
*   **URL Parameters:** The attack utilizes the `action` and `email` parameters in the URL.
*   **SQL Injection Payload:** The attacker provides `%` as the value for the 'email' parameter, which is then used within a SQL LIKE clause.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Dolibarr instance, but no prior authentication or privileges are needed.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker only needs basic knowledge about how to send HTTP requests with URL parameters to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered during a penetration test.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Dolibarr version 16.0.5.
*   Dolibarr version 17 disables access to this page by default, requiring a specific setting to re-enable it, indicating that the developers are aware of the potential risk.
*   The initial fix was a regression introduced by commit `be82f51`, which was then addressed by `bb7b69e`, which changed the parameter sanitization from `alphanohtml` back to `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL`, but did not fix the SQL injection vulnerability. This was later fixed by using a parametrized query instead of concatenating the user input.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a CVSSv3 score of 7.5, but due to the ease of exploitation and the sensitive data exposed, it was considered a critical vulnerability.

In summary, this vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to extract sensitive contact data from a vulnerable Dolibarr instance by exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability through a publicly accessible AJAX endpoint.
