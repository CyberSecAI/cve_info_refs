# Project identifier information leakage through robots.txt

High

[oliverguenther](/oliverguenther)
published
GHSA-xjfc-fqm3-95q8
Jun 1, 2023

## Package

OpenProject

## Affected versions

all

## Patched versions

12.5.6

## Description

### Impact

For any OpenProject installation, a robots.txt file is generated through the server to denote which routes shall or shall not be accessed by crawlers. These routes contain project identifiers of all public projects in the instance. Even if the entire instance is marked as "Login required" and prevents all truly anonymous access, the /robots.txt route remains publicly available.

### Patches

You can download the following patchfile to apply the patch to any OpenProject version > 10.0: <https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/opf/openproject/pull/12708.patch>

### Workarounds

Mark any public project as non-public for the time being and give anyone in need of access to the project a membership.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Release date: 2023-06-01

We released [OpenProject 12.5.6](https://community.openproject.com/versions/1794).

The release contains a security related bug fix and we recommend updating to the newest version.

### CVE-2023-31140: Project identifier information leakage through robots.txt

For any OpenProject installation, a robots.txt file is generated through the server to denote which routes shall or shall not be accessed by crawlers. These routes contain project identifiers of all public projects in the instance. Even if the entire instance is marked as "Login required" and prevents all truly anonymous access, the /robots.txt route remains publicly available.

This results in the URL part of the project (i.e., the project identifier) to be publicly visible. As these identifiers are derived from the project name, they may contain sensitive information.

For more information, [please see our security advisory](https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-xjfc-fqm3-95q8).

**Patches**

You can download the following patchfile to apply the patch to any OpenProject version > 10.0: <https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/opf/openproject/pull/12708.patch>

**Workaround**

If you are unable to update or apply the provided patch, mark any public project as non-public for the time being and give anyone in need of access to the project a membership.
