- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient path validation when displaying the details of a note received through an externally-provided intent.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper validation of file paths for attachments within notes, specifically when the note is received via an external intent. This allowed a malicious application to provide an arbitrary file path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious application can force Omni-notes to copy files from its internal storage to its external storage directory. These files become accessible to any component with permission to read the external storage. This enables an attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data stored within the application's internal storage.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs via an externally provided intent that triggers the display of a note. The attacker crafts an intent containing an attachment path to a file they want to exfiltrate.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have another application installed on the same Android device, with the capability to send specially crafted intents. The attacker does not need any special permissions other than to read the files on external storage.
