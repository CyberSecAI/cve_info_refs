# Missing Access Control allows User to move and duplicate tasks to any project in the software

Moderate

Jun 3, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 1.2.29

## Patched versions

1.2.30

## Description

### Summary

A **missing access control vulnerability** that allows a user with **low privileges** to create or transfer tasks to **any project** within the software, even if they have **not been invited** or the project is **personal**.

The vulnerable features are **Duplicate to project** and **Move to project**, which both utilize the `checkDestinationProjectValues()` function to check his values.

### Details

The vulnerability lays in the function **checkDestinationProjectValues** in the **/app/Model/TaskDuplicationModel.php** file, line **88** :

```
 public function checkDestinationProjectValues(array &$values)
    {
        // Check if the assigned user is allowed for the destination project
        if ($values['owner_id'] > 0 && ! $this->projectPermissionModel->isUserAllowed($values['project_id'], $values['owner_id'])) {
            $values['owner_id'] = 0;
        }

        // Check if the category exists for the destination project
        if ($values['category_id'] > 0) {
            $values['category_id'] = $this->categoryModel->getIdByName(
                $values['project_id'],
                $this->categoryModel->getNameById($values['category_id'])
            );
        }

        // Check if the swimlane exists for the destination project
        $values['swimlane_id'] = $this->swimlaneModel->getIdByName(
            $values['project_id'],
            $this->swimlaneModel->getNameById($values['swimlane_id'])
        );

        if ($values['swimlane_id'] == 0) {
            $values['swimlane_id'] = $this->swimlaneModel->getFirstActiveSwimlaneId($values['project_id']);
        }

        // Check if the column exists for the destination project
        if ($values['column_id'] > 0) {
            $values['column_id'] = $this->columnModel->getColumnIdByTitle(
                $values['project_id'],
                $this->columnModel->getColumnTitleById($values['column_id'])
            );

            $values['column_id'] = $values['column_id'] ?: $this->columnModel->getFirstColumnId($values['project_id']);
        }

        // Check if priority exists for destination project
        $values['priority'] = $this->projectTaskPriorityModel->getPriorityForProject(
            $values['project_id'],
            empty($values['priority']) ? 0 : $values['priority']
        );

        return $values;
    }
```

As we can see, there's a check in this part of the code to check if the User is allowed to move to the project declared :

```
if ($values['owner_id'] > 0 && ! $this->projectPermissionModel->isUserAllowed($values['project_id'], $values['owner_id'])) {
            $values['owner_id'] = 0;
}
```

However, only assigning **0** to the owner\_id variable is **not enough** because it doesn't prevent the code from keeping running.

This means that unauthorized users can still add tasks to other projects.

**Note:** It is also necessary to check the **owner\_id** value and make sure it cannot be modified by the users as someone can equal to the **owner id** of the project that users is trying to exploit and that way bypass the `isUserAllowed()` function

### PoC

1. Go to any task you wish to move and click on **Move to Project**
2. Select a random project you have, click **Save**, and intercept the request.
3. Change the value **project\_id** to any project ID you want.
4. After that, the task gets added to the Project you've chosen ( even tho it's not yours )

**Note:** The admin project showed in the video it's a **personal project**.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
