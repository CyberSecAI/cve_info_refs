**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can deploy malicious WAR files, potentially leading to remote code execution and full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to the `/upgrade` endpoint of the Talend Data Catalog remote harvesting server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must have network access to the affected server and be able to send HTTP requests to the `/upgrade` endpoint. No authentication is required.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated

**Mitigation:**
- The remote harvesting server should be placed behind a firewall that restricts access to only the Talend Data Catalog server.
