    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2023-33863",
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow when handling a client-provided length for a string.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow",
        "Heap-based buffer overflow"
      ],
       "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can overflow a heap-based buffer, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the machine running RenderDoc.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network"
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a specially crafted handshake packet with a string length of 0xffffffff to the RenderDoc server over TCP port 38920.",
       "details": "When a client sends a string of 0xffffffff bytes, the server casts this to a signed integer and then to a size_t, which becomes SIZE_MAX (0xffffffffffffffff). When allocating memory, the size is incremented resulting in an integer overflow to 0, leading to the allocation of a smaller buffer than needed. When the server copies the client-provided data it overflows this buffer."
