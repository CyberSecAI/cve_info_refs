The provided content relates to CVE-2023-33289.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a regular expression used for trimming file extensions (e.g., `.html`) in URLs during normalization. The regex is vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the URL normalization process. The regex defined for trimming `.html` extensions is inefficient and can lead to excessive backtracking when processing malicious input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A specially crafted URL can cause the application to become unresponsive, consuming significant CPU resources and leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can provide a malicious URL to the `urlnorm` library, which when processed using the vulnerable regex, triggers the ReDoS vulnerability. The malicious URL contains a large number of repeated file extensions (e.g., "A5.html"), which causes the regex engine to backtrack extensively and take a long time to complete.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply an input URL to the `urlnorm` library.
