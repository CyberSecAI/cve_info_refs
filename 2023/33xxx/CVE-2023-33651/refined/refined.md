The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Sitecore 9.3, including:

**1. IIS Authorization Bypass via `Server.Execute` leading to RCE**
   - **Root Cause:** The `ExecuteHandlerAction` in `Sitecore.Mvc.DeviceSimulator.Controllers.SimulatorController` uses `Server.Execute` without proper sanitization of the `previewPath` parameter. This allows redirecting execution to arbitrary files within the webroot, bypassing IIS-level access controls.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
        - Unvalidated input to `Server.Execute`.
        - Lack of authorization checks within `ExecuteHandlerAction`.
        - Improper usage of `Server.Execute`, allowing bypass of IIS-level authorization.
   - **Impact:**
        - Arbitrary file access within the webroot, including sensitive files like `license.xml` and configuration backups.
        - Remote code execution can be achieved by combining the file access with a Telerik deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-18935) using leaked encryption keys from a configuration file.
   - **Attack Vectors:**
        - Sending a crafted HTTP request to `api/sitecore/Sitecore.Mvc.DeviceSimulator.Controllers.SimulatorController,Sitecore.Mvc.DeviceSimulator.dll/Preview` with a malicious `previewPath` to redirect the request.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        - Unauthenticated access to the Sitecore instance.
        - Ability to send HTTP requests.

**2. Unsafe Reflection via `Invoke.aspx` leading to RCE**
   - **Root Cause:** The `Invoke.aspx` page uses `ReflectionUtil.CallMethod` to instantiate arbitrary classes and execute any instance method, with string parameters, on the instance.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
        - Unrestricted class instantiation and method invocation through reflection.
        - Lack of input validation when calling `ReflectionUtil.CallMethod`
   - **Impact:**
        - Remote code execution via deserialization vulnerability in `Telerik.Web.UI.RadPivotGrid` when calling the setter for `FiltersPersistence` with a malicious payload.
   - **Attack Vectors:**
        - Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/sitecore/shell/Invoke.aspx` with a malicious `__OBJECT` parameter.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
       - Authenticated access to the Sitecore instance to access the `/sitecore/shell/Invoke.aspx` page.
   
**3. EXM (Email Experience Manager) Authorization Bypass**
   - **Root Cause:** The `LoadEmailRenderSessionUser` pipeline processor in EXM sets the HttpContext user to the configured Renderer User based on provided `ec_message_id` and `ec_id` query parameters, without proper validation or authentication.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
        - Missing checks on the validity of `ec_message_id` and `ec_id` parameters.
        - Unsafe setting of `HttpContext.User`.
   - **Impact:**
        - Ability to bypass authentication and access restricted resources by leveraging a valid `ec_message_id` and `ec_id` parameters.
        - Can be combined with the `Server.Execute` vulnerability to gain unauthenticated remote code execution by using the RCE on the Invoke.aspx page.
   - **Attack Vectors:**
        - Sending a crafted HTTP request including valid `ec_message_id` and `ec_id` parameters to trigger the authentication bypass, and redirect to `/sitecore/shell/Invoke.aspx` to trigger the unsafe reflection vulnerability.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
         - Unauthenticated access to the Sitecore instance.
        - Valid `ec_message_id` and `ec_id` parameters (obtainable through the mailing list).

**4. Authenticated RCE via HTML Conversion Pipeline**
   - **Root Cause:**  The `Sitecore.Pipelines.ConvertToRuntimeHtml.ConvertWebControls` pipeline processor processes unfiltered input and calls `Sitecore.Convert.Base64ToObject`, which deserializes arbitrary data via `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize`.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
        - Unfiltered input is passed to `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize` via the `Base64ToObject` method.
   - **Impact:**
         - Remote code execution.
   - **Attack Vectors:**
        - Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/sitecore/shell/Applications/Content%20Manager/Execute.aspx?cmd=convert&mode=HTML` with a malicious payload in the html parameter.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
         - Authenticated access to the Sitecore instance to access the endpoint.
