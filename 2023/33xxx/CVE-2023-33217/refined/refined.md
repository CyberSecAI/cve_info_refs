- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing integrity check on the firmware upgrade package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of integrity check in the firmware upgrade mechanism. This allows a malicious firmware to be loaded onto the device.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can lead to a permanent denial of service, rendering the terminal unusable and requiring the device to be sent back to the manufacturer for recovery.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by abusing the firmware upgrade mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned except that the attacker must be able to supply a malicious firmware package to the device using the upgrade mechanism. By default this can be done remotely with no authentication, however if the device is configured with enforced security mode or mTLS is enabled, the attacker needs to be authenticated.
