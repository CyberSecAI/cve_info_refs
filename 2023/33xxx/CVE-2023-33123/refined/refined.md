- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted CGM files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious CGM file in the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious CGM file. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system, and this vulnerability can be exploited locally.
