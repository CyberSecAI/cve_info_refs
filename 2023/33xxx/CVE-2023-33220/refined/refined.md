- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of boundary checks during the process of copying attributes while validating a retrofit package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Potential Remote Code Execution on the targeted device.
- **Attack vectors:** Network based, by sending a crafted retrofit validation command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. However, if the device has enabled mTLS or enforced security mode, then the attacker needs to have high privileges.
