- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of permission control in the Amazon module for PrestaShop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Inadequate access controls allowed guest users to access personal data, including order secrets. The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Exposure of personal information from the `ps_customer` table, such as name and surname. Also, the exposed order secret could be used in other modules to bypass access control. The module could also expose other sensitive technical information in other ways.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges or user interaction are required, meaning an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
