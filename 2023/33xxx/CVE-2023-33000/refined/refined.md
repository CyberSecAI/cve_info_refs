  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2023-33000": {
      "root_cause": "The NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin stores credentials in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration. Although the credentials are encrypted on disk, they are displayed unmasked on the job configuration form.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Credentials displayed without masking"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can observe and capture the credentials when they are displayed unmasked on the job configuration form, increasing the potential for credential compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the job configuration form in the Jenkins UI.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to access the job configuration form to observe the unmasked credentials."
    }
