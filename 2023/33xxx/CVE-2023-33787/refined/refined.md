The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Netbox version 3.5.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when creating a tenant group, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization for the "Name" field when creating a tenant group.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
- Full compromise of the user's account.
- Stealing of session cookies.
- Defacement of the application.
- Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Name" field when creating a tenant group.
- When a user views a site that is associated with the malicious tenant group, the stored XSS is triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
- The attacker must be able to access the "Create Tenant Groups" functionality within the "Organization" feature.
