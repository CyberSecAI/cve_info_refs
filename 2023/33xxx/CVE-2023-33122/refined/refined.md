- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected applications contain an out-of-bounds read vulnerability while parsing a specially crafted CGM file. Specifically, the read occurs past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: This vulnerability could allow an attacker to disclose sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious CGM file needs to be opened by the user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious CGM file and trick a user into opening it with the vulnerable application. User interaction is required.
