- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists while parsing specially crafted CGM files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Null pointer dereference (CWE-476)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could crash the application, causing a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application reads malicious CGM files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious CGM file with the affected products. The attacker needs local access, no privileges, user interaction is required and the scope is unchanged.
