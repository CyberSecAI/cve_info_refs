### @mydea **[mydea](/mydea)** commented [Mar 20, 2023](#issue-1632391748)

Actually I noticed that `el.type` returns `text` when type is not explicitly set, so this is slightly incorrect.

This was slightly incorrect in [#1170](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/pull/1170)

Sorry, something went wrong.

# html inputs of type password recorded in plaintext when converted to text inputs

Moderate

[Vadman97](/Vadman97)
published
GHSA-9qpj-qq2r-5mcc
May 25, 2023

## Package

npm

highlight.run
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<6.0.0

## Patched versions

6.0.0

## Description

### Impact

Highlight may record passwords on customer deployments when a password html input is switched to `type="text"` via a javascript "Show Password" button. This differs from the expected behavior which always obfuscates `type="password"` inputs. A customer may assume that switching to `type="text"` would also not record this input; hence, they would not add additional `highlight-mask` css-class obfuscation to this part of the DOM, resulting in unintentional recording of a password value when a `Show Password` button is used.

### Patches

`highlight.run@6.0.0` resolves the issue via [rrweb-io/rrweb#1184](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/pull/1184)

This patch tracks changes to the `type` attribute of an input to ensure an input that used to be a `type="password"` continues to be obfuscated.

### Workarounds

We have deployed a change to our data ingest to obfuscate passwords server side from older clients.

This means that upgrading to the latest version of highlight.run is not necessary but recommended to prevent potential network transfer of recorded password data to our backend.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
