- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption while parsing specially crafted CGM files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious CGM file using the affected applications (JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a malicious CGM file to a user of the affected software, and the user must open the file. No special privileges or network access is required.
