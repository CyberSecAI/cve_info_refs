- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Marval MSM uses a static encryption key and IV for storing secrets in the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Use of a static, shared encryption key and IV for all instances of Marval MSM.
    - The encryption algorithm used is TripleDES.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker who gains access to the encrypted secrets from a database dump can decrypt the secrets using the static key and IV from another instance. This could expose stored credentials and other sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Gaining access to a database dump from a Marval MSM instance.
    - Obtaining the static encryption key and IV from a different Marval MSM instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have access to a database dump of a vulnerable Marval MSM instance.
    - The attacker also needs to have access to a different instance of Marval MSM to extract the static encryption key and IV.
    - The attacker needs to be able to decrypt the data.
