Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-33958:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `notation verify` command did not limit the number of signature attempts when verifying an artifact.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of limit on signature attempts during the verification process. This allows an attacker to potentially provide an infinite number of signatures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) on the host machine running the `notation verify` command. The process can be overwhelmed if the registry sends an infinite number of signatures.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network based attack where an attacker controls or compromises a registry.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs control over a container registry that can be used by the `notation verify` command. The attacker must be capable of serving an unlimited number of signatures for a given artifact.
- User interaction is required as the user needs to run `notation verify` command.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was found during a security audit.
- The issue is fixed in version 1.0.0-rc.6 of the `notation` package.
- The CVSS score is 5.4, which is considered moderate.
- There is no specific CWE assigned to this vulnerability.
