# Default `maxSignatureAttempts` in `notation verify` enables an endless data attack

## Package

gomod

github.com/notaryproject/notation
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.0.0-rc.6

## Patched versions

1.0.0-rc.6

## Description

### Impact

An attacker who controls or compromises a registry can make the registry serve an infinite number of signatures for the artifact, causing a denial of service to the host machine running `notation verify`.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in the release [v1.0.0-rc.6](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.6). Users should upgrade their notation packages to [v1.0.0-rc.6](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.6) or above.

### Workarounds

User should use secure and trusted container registries

### Credits

The `notation` project would like to thank Adam Korczynski ([@AdamKorcz](https://github.com/AdamKorcz)) for responsibly disclosing the issue found during an security audit (facilitated by OSTIF and sponsored by CNCF) and Shiwei Zhang ([@shizhMSFT](https://github.com/shizhMSFT)) for root cause analysis.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L

### CVE ID
