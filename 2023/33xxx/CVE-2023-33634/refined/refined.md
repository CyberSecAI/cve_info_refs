- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow occurs in the `EdittriggerList` function due to insufficient bounds checking when processing input from the `param` parameter. The `getElement` function splits the input string, but the size of the local variable receiving the split strings is fixed at 20 bytes, while `getElement` allows for a maximum split string size of 64 bytes. This mismatch causes the buffer to overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow. The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper size validation when handling the input string within the `EdittriggerList` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a stack overflow, causing the web process to crash. It can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker crafts a specific exploit, potentially allowing them to gain a root shell on the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint with the `CMD=EdittriggerList` and a long string in the `param` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface, which requires network connectivity to the device. The attacker also needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameters. The attacker is expected to be on the same network or have access to the router.
