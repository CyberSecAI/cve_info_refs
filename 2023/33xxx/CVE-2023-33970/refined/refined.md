Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing access control check in the `create()` and `update()` functions within `TaskLinkModel.php` when creating or updating internal task links. Specifically, the application did not verify if the user had permission to access the "opposite task" (the task being linked to) before creating or modifying the link.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Broken Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is the lack of authorization checks, allowing a user to interact with resources they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Information Leakage:**  By manipulating the `opposite_task_id` during the creation or update of a task link, an attacker can cause the application to expose information (task and project titles) of tasks that should be inaccessible to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** An attacker with the lowest user privileges can access and leak the titles of all tasks and projects within the application. This can expose sensitive information contained within task/project titles.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** While not explicitly detailed, leaking task information could potentially aid an attacker in planning further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network using standard web requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account with the lowest level of privileges within the application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the application.
*   **Ability to Intercept/Modify HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP request parameters sent to the application to inject a target `opposite_task_id`.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of Kanboard `<= 1.2.29` are vulnerable.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is addressed by adding permission checks within the `createTaskLink` and `updateTaskLink` functions in `app/Api/Procedure/TaskLinkProcedure.php` and `save` and `update` functions in `app/Controller/TaskInternalLinkController.php` .
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided Python script demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability to enumerate tasks and their project titles by iterating through task IDs, creating a task link using the manipulated `opposite_task_id` parameter, then retrieving task and project details, and finally deleting the created task link.
*   **CVSS v3 Score:** 5.4 (Moderate) with a vector string of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N` which reflects the vulnerability being network-based, low complexity, requiring low privileges, no user interaction, an unchanged scope, low impact to confidentiality and integrity, and no impact to availability.

In summary, the provided content clearly demonstrates a broken access control vulnerability that allows a low-privilege user to leak sensitive task and project information.
