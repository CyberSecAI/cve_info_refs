[00:00] all right thank you so I'm going to talk
[00:02] about a
[00:04] ultrasonic attack on network
[00:06] communication environments we call it
[00:07] Nuance my co-author Force McKee and I'm
[00:10] David Nova and we're in the United
[00:12] States
[00:13] so the problem statement we're trying to
[00:15] address is can an attacker or a hacker
[00:19] send inaudible commands covertly onto
[00:23] voice activated devices so this is
[00:26] largely a demonstration from
[00:27] experimental standpoint but also we
[00:30] wanted to understand
[00:31] the nature of these voice activated
[00:34] devices how common are there are they
[00:37] and where would they appear in
[00:39] day-to-day live
[00:41] so the outline of the talk is I'm going
[00:43] to go through an introduction it's both
[00:45] a hardware and software vulnerability
[00:48] and voice active activated devices so
[00:50] that actually can be the phone or it can
[00:53] be a computer if you have Windows
[00:56] Cortana or it can be a standalone device
[01:00] like a Amazon Alexa
[01:03] we're going to demonstrate that we've uh
[01:07] all we've developed it as what's called
[01:09] knew it attack so that was a term that
[01:12] was first coined in February of 2023
[01:16] as the near ultrasound inaudible Trojan
[01:20] there are two versions we'll discuss one
[01:22] is a single
[01:24] device so that could be your phone uh
[01:27] broadcasting and receiving or it can be
[01:30] two devices so a phone broadcasting to a
[01:33] computer or vice versa and we're going
[01:36] to extend that to multiple networked
[01:39] configurations so you might consider if
[01:42] it's new at one and two we're going to
[01:44] talk about new at n
[01:46] which is multiple network devices and
[01:48] each one of these devices will have
[01:50] escalating skills meaning they could do
[01:53] different kinds of things on voice
[01:55] activation and also larger attack
[01:57] surfaces it's largely a demonstration
[01:59] we're going to we're going to show you
[02:00] some scoring results and finally discuss
[02:03] future work so this is basically the
[02:06] attack we're talking about
[02:08] an attacker comes up with a phone
[02:11] recording in this case most of these
[02:14] devices these are Amazon Alexa's most of
[02:18] these devices with a wake word such as
[02:21] Alexa or hey Google or hey Cortana or
[02:26] hey Siri those would be four examples of
[02:29] of common devices but rather than
[02:32] broadcast in the audible range you can
[02:36] shift the frequency to a range that's
[02:41] generally speaking inaudible to humans
[02:43] so that begins about 16 kilohertz word
[02:47] as a high frequency attack so in some
[02:50] some people like to call it a dog
[02:51] whistle attack you've taken a normal
[02:54] command and you've shifted its frequency
[02:57] and so there's a couple different
[02:59] configurations in this case the phone is
[03:02] the broadcaster and The Internet of
[03:05] Things device is the receiver
[03:07] um
[03:08] the reason it exists is because micro
[03:11] these microphones are have a gain to
[03:14] them or a non-linear gain particularly
[03:17] at the high frequency range and so we'll
[03:19] take advantage of that but this would be
[03:21] a classic what would be called a two
[03:24] device attack an Android device to an
[03:27] echo dot generation two or three and you
[03:30] might the attack might simply say Alexa
[03:32] what's the weather
[03:34] and no one else in the room would be
[03:37] aware of this attack so it's somewhat of
[03:39] a stealth attack
[03:40] so why be interested in voice activated
[03:43] devices and why might they need security
[03:46] references
[03:48] um there are about 8.4 billion digital
[03:51] devices expected in 2024 that's doubling
[03:54] from the current number which is about
[03:56] 4.2 billion so basically one device per
[04:01] human globally
[04:03] um these are listing devices really
[04:05] within Arm's Reach almost any time of
[04:07] the day particularly the phone uh 36
[04:10] percent of global users have a voice
[04:13] activated phone or some capability to
[04:16] reach it through voice of course the
[04:19] convenience is the internet of things
[04:20] such as a personal assistant or music
[04:23] player and of course it's not just that
[04:25] the devices have them but about 3.4 3.1
[04:29] billion voice searches appear per month
[04:32] so Alexa tell me the weather is an
[04:35] example
[04:36] um and that's about
[04:38] four per person per year
[04:41] one of the strange things from
[04:43] convenience when you think about the way
[04:44] that these devices are set up is that
[04:47] they have no natural concept of
[04:49] administrative privilege or identity so
[04:52] you could say
[04:53] [Music]
[04:53] um
[04:54] uh there's some of them you can
[04:57] establish a profile but basically
[04:59] there's no common sense of voice
[05:01] authentication uh Siri probably is the
[05:04] first one to have any sort of profile in
[05:06] a biometric sense
[05:08] the other interesting part about these
[05:10] voice activated devices is how much
[05:12] potential power they give to the
[05:15] attacker so for example you can access
[05:17] someone's search history what what this
[05:21] device looked for last week and we'll
[05:24] show some examples of that you also can
[05:26] probe or search personal information
[05:28] such as prior purchases uh you can look
[05:32] at someone's personal finance or in fact
[05:35] trigger purchases
[05:38] particularly on the Amazon side
[05:41] uh people obviously aren't unaware of
[05:43] this about 42 percent of the shoppers
[05:46] for voice activated devices site audio
[05:49] security as their number one buying
[05:52] concern
[05:54] so this is kind of a pictorial way of
[05:56] showing that that these always listening
[05:58] microphones have become quite popular
[06:01] and they are in a common interface to
[06:04] our security environment
[06:08] um this is a matrix which kind of
[06:10] describes the the sender and receiver in
[06:13] this attack so and the references here
[06:16] are prior prior work so for example an
[06:20] iPhone attacking an iPhone
[06:22] uh this could be a self-attack or it
[06:25] could be a cross attack between source
[06:28] and Target iPhone attacking Alexa iPhone
[06:31] attacking a computer if if it's a
[06:34] Windows computer Cortana iPhone
[06:36] attacking an Android phone and finally
[06:39] you can embed these uh voice activation
[06:42] within the silent parts of another
[06:45] broadcast so it could sit on YouTube and
[06:49] finally many of these voice activated
[06:51] devices control other parts of the home
[06:55] so for example you can have a a voice
[06:57] activated Alexa that unlocks the door
[07:00] and so there have been probably four to
[07:03] five major papers that have attempted to
[07:05] kind of map this Matrix we're we're
[07:08] primarily going to focus on this part
[07:11] which is using an Android phone to
[07:14] attack an Alexa device an interesting
[07:16] and interesting ways
[07:18] so I do mention prior security work on
[07:21] voice activation this also includes
[07:23] sensors associated with ultrasound on uh
[07:28] for example a car but they go by these
[07:31] broad sense of dolphin attack meaning
[07:34] it's a distorted command at high
[07:37] frequency
[07:39] um the difference between what we're
[07:40] doing and what this is
[07:42] typically is these require some kind of
[07:45] special uh amplifier like you you would
[07:49] they don't have an obvious way you could
[07:51] just in a stealth way take a device up
[07:54] to another device they need some
[07:56] augmentation another one is a surfing
[08:00] attack so that would be like a long
[08:02] range attack
[08:04] with a voice assistant that you just
[08:06] broadcast out ultrasound it's almost
[08:10] more like a jamming attack
[08:13] um
[08:14] the other one is is of course
[08:17] using ultrasound high frequency to
[08:20] broadcast so create a covert channel
[08:22] that is beyond human hearing and then
[08:26] finally the group we're really talking
[08:28] about
[08:30] um which is inaudible Trojan so you're
[08:33] sending a an unwanted command to another
[08:36] device
[08:37] either in one or two pairs
[08:41] so there are a number of places in our
[08:46] lives that these exist they and they
[08:48] certainly aren't just internet of Home
[08:50] things their internet of all kinds of
[08:52] things including uh the cars including
[08:55] workplaces including many of them your
[08:58] entire Computing experiences run through
[09:02] uh say Hey Cortana exercise from uh on
[09:07] the window side and of course different
[09:11] personal assistants so it's it's it's a
[09:14] pretty broad spectrum of uh what you
[09:16] could call the attack surface
[09:19] so what do people use voice activation
[09:22] for and this will get really to the
[09:24] heart of what we try to accomplish in
[09:27] the paper and this is kind of a
[09:29] frequency from a a
[09:33] industry survey in which uh this is the
[09:37] rank order of questions I asked to voice
[09:41] acted many devices and most of these are
[09:44] kind of the convenience questions so you
[09:46] want to listen to the news or set alarm
[09:49] but very quickly when you get it down
[09:52] into this group these are quite personal
[09:54] questions such as control my smart home
[09:57] or access my calendar or message someone
[10:00] or finally make a purchase so in this
[10:03] case you know probably 30 30 35 percent
[10:07] um of all use frequencies do involve uh
[10:11] the person has at least once tried to
[10:13] make a purchase from the voice activated
[10:15] device so if in the extreme case you
[10:18] could imagine someone sort of walking
[10:20] around with their wallet or their purse
[10:22] and someone inadvertently in a stealth
[10:24] sort of way could
[10:26] um trigger that person open
[10:30] um and generally speaking these are
[10:31] these kind of escalation of activities
[10:35] that can happen in an ultrasound way can
[10:38] trigger some very unusual skills so we
[10:41] used to we looked at the example of the
[10:45] Amazon Alexa universe but almost all of
[10:49] these devices do have a a sort of skill
[10:52] associated with them uh um in fact that
[10:56] Alexa university has about 70 000
[10:58] different skills everything from tell me
[11:01] a joke to
[11:03] purchase something to check my bank
[11:05] account
[11:06] so this is an interesting
[11:09] um this is actually from a U.S patent
[11:11] that Amazon got for the Lexa but the
[11:14] cartoon here is
[11:17] um the the person in this case uh just
[11:21] coughs and that Alexa hears that
[11:26] um trigger and that leads to a whole
[11:28] Cascade of events everything from uh
[11:31] sort of ordering uh food for the cough
[11:34] so you know ordering chicken soup in
[11:37] this case or it can start ordering cough
[11:40] drops for you just from the cough and
[11:43] then finally you know confirm that order
[11:46] so I think this is kind of an
[11:48] interesting
[11:49] uh event Cascade from something that
[11:53] maybe people don't expect these devices
[11:56] to do but uh it's it's a single trigger
[12:00] that leads to either medical advice
[12:02] cooking instructions or in some sense a
[12:05] purchase agreement
[12:08] um the other thing that was kind of
[12:09] interesting is uh what a second patent
[12:13] issue to Amazon many of these may not be
[12:16] on every device but it's an interesting
[12:18] kind of way of thinking about the attack
[12:20] surface and that we call in the paper
[12:23] kind of a poisoning attack in the sense
[12:25] that this is a typical recommender
[12:27] system that Amazon is describing so the
[12:31] device is listening in the background to
[12:33] a story about a vacation to the zoo
[12:36] it um the device is is enabled to pull
[12:40] out key events from the conversation
[12:43] such as who's the speaker
[12:46] um what are they talking about in this
[12:48] case a winery in Santa Barbara and
[12:50] they've uh they're actually two speakers
[12:52] in this conversation and they're
[12:55] attaching different interests to them so
[12:57] it's not all that different from
[12:59] shopping on Amazon where you for example
[13:01] view an item I think it's just a little
[13:04] maybe uh it's less
[13:06] comfortable when it's extracting your
[13:09] likes and dislikes from the conversation
[13:11] itself and this is kind of a cartoon I
[13:14] think from a Google home example of uh
[13:17] at the say 66 different places these
[13:21] devices typically might sit in a home
[13:24] so one of the things we did is we did a
[13:27] classic teardown of the echo Dot and so
[13:31] if you unpack this
[13:32] this device during the attack or
[13:36] certainly as to try to understand what's
[13:38] happening
[13:40] um the key to this there are really four
[13:43] well there are two printed circuit
[13:46] boards and then there's an interface
[13:48] that the user has which is really these
[13:51] buttons turn up the volume turn down the
[13:53] volume
[13:55] mute the device or give it power but
[13:58] these what we're showing here from our
[14:01] teardown are these seven spots which are
[14:04] also shaded with the microphone so it
[14:07] has some ability when it gets a command
[14:10] um the blue The Familiar blue ring will
[14:13] trigger this as I'm listening and if you
[14:16] have a device that has the ultrasound
[14:18] attack replaying then that device can be
[14:22] owned through these microphones there's
[14:25] other interesting parts to this like
[14:28] this the speaker itself
[14:30] and the speaker contacts that we were
[14:32] able to identify by part number
[14:36] so this is the basic
[14:38] ultrasound attack in a different in a
[14:41] different view so
[14:43] um in some sense it's a it's a modulated
[14:45] signal so
[14:47] um in the original paper from uh other
[14:51] researchers who started looking at this
[14:53] it's sometimes called the single upper
[14:55] sideband amplitude modulation or sus
[14:58] bomb
[14:59] um but the idea is to take the 0 to 20
[15:04] roughly 22 000 kilohertz signal of a
[15:08] spoken command and and flatten the
[15:12] amplitude below 16 kilohertz so this
[15:15] makes it inaudible to the human ear it
[15:18] could be audible to babies or small
[15:21] children
[15:21] at a certain age the human ear no longer
[15:26] can hear these high frequency sounds but
[15:29] the message is flattened here and
[15:31] shifted here
[15:33] um you think if you took this entire
[15:36] frequency space and and shifted the bell
[15:40] curve or the or the frequency
[15:42] here it turns out you do not get enough
[15:46] uh bandwidth in frequency space to get
[15:51] the command to trigger so you cut the
[15:54] the signal in half and you take just the
[15:58] right half of the bell curve so that's
[16:01] why you get this sort of familiar shape
[16:04] and it can happen on any command and we
[16:07] did about 50 different Alexa experiments
[16:09] where we're issuing commands doing for
[16:12] the device to do different things and
[16:14] each time we
[16:15] flat and low frequency and then cut off
[16:18] the left arm of this curve in time
[16:22] domain this is the waveform so this
[16:25] would be four repetitions of Alexa
[16:27] what's the weather Alexa what's the
[16:29] weather Alexa what's the weather Etc and
[16:33] that would be one session and then we do
[16:37] that multiple times and watch the
[16:39] results
[16:40] spectrogram again is is a version of
[16:43] this but you see there's no real power
[16:46] to the Spectrum below 16 kilohertz and
[16:49] this is where your sort of four prong
[16:52] signal Alexa where's the weather Alexa
[16:54] where the weather all the amp all the
[16:57] power is in the high frequency
[16:59] this is a different version of that
[17:01] which is overlaid on the same signal and
[17:04] you'll see a couple of these but this is
[17:06] your original
[17:08] human spoken term this is the modulated
[17:11] version and this is the waveform as it
[17:14] might appear on the microphone
[17:17] so
[17:18] um The Original Part contribution of the
[17:21] work is to generalize what previously
[17:24] has been shown as a one or two device
[17:25] attack into multiple attacks people have
[17:30] um you know anywhere from eight to ten
[17:32] of these in different rooms of the house
[17:33] or different rooms of the business or
[17:36] you can imagine
[17:37] uh in a conference room the number of
[17:40] phones that might be listening so this
[17:43] would be what we would describe as an
[17:45] ultrasound 3 attack this device is
[17:47] broadcasting to these two Internet of
[17:51] Things devices and they both activate at
[17:53] the same time executing different
[17:55] commands and this would be a the
[17:58] generalization to four so you have your
[18:01] attacker device here which is replaying
[18:03] an ultrasound attack inaudibly in these
[18:06] uh human but these three devices pick up
[18:09] on it simultaneously
[18:12] so we wanted to be a little systematic
[18:14] and disciplined about the way to
[18:16] approach
[18:17] um this kind of attack and so we did
[18:19] want to map it to What's called the
[18:20] miter attack framework for people in
[18:23] cyber security this is kind of familiar
[18:25] but um generally speaking this is a is a
[18:28] kind of slice of that table in which
[18:31] you're looking at uh what the attacker
[18:33] might want to achieve so for example
[18:36] initial access to the device
[18:38] typically even in an audible sense is
[18:42] quite easy you know that's the purpose
[18:44] of these convenience devices is given a
[18:47] wake word
[18:48] gain initial access so sometimes you
[18:52] could imagine this would be drive by
[18:54] compromise the attacker just passes the
[18:57] device and his recording is playing on a
[19:01] loop and that would be a drive-by
[19:03] compromise
[19:04] the good part is you're interested in
[19:06] defending against these kind of attacks
[19:08] and so each attack is paired to
[19:12] um what's called the defend attack so it
[19:15] is written in this Elite form of uh
[19:18] where in alphabetic terms given a number
[19:20] but generally someone like initial
[19:22] access is really a user training issue
[19:24] like set up a profile that only responds
[19:27] to your voice so that would be security
[19:30] awareness training and then in the paper
[19:32] we map whether that tactic and technique
[19:36] of the attacker also has a tactic and
[19:39] technique for the defender and whether
[19:41] the device or this
[19:43] approach is potentially an ultrasonic
[19:47] attack
[19:48] privilege escalation is I gain uh sort
[19:52] of power to execute commands on a valid
[19:55] account and credential access is a third
[19:57] category where I'm able to hold an
[20:00] ongoing conversation with device without
[20:02] the user's knowledge
[20:05] so this is a scorecard from the paper of
[20:07] us running 50 different commands so this
[20:11] is a list
[20:12] since simple tabulation of the multiple
[20:16] commands so for example Alexa set the
[20:19] volume to five that's typically a first
[20:22] move if you're an attacker is you don't
[20:26] want even though your broadcasting
[20:29] inaudibly you don't want the device to
[20:32] speak at speak respond uh in a high
[20:36] volume sense so a lot of the first
[20:38] attack is set the volume to six percent
[20:41] or something like that and so we tracked
[20:44] whether you could do that in the audible
[20:46] space for 50 commands and that had 100
[20:49] success right and then this category is
[20:52] whether the device in this case an echo
[20:56] generation 2 whether that failed or
[21:00] succeeded and there's two versions of
[21:02] success here one is did it trigger any
[21:05] response of acknowledgment so the blue
[21:08] ring on the device comes on so it's
[21:10] listening or did it fully succeed
[21:13] meaning it executed the command meaning
[21:16] you ask it what the weather is in
[21:18] audibly and it responds audibly and it
[21:21] turns out the success rate overall in
[21:24] the ultrasound version is 58
[21:28] really only 16 percent failed outright
[21:33] um 26 percent at least triggered
[21:35] acknowledgment and 58 triggered the
[21:39] actual command execute so we wanted that
[21:44] raises some interesting questions we did
[21:47] use a text to speech generator just to
[21:51] make it all sort of repeatable so this
[21:55] is not triggering by a particular
[21:56] person's voice and we did use the same
[21:59] ultrasonic algorithm to shift the
[22:02] frequency so you can ask why are these
[22:04] devices only 60 successful really 85
[22:08] percent successful at least in one
[22:11] capacity and so we wanted to segregate
[22:14] those results and explore some
[22:16] additional Network skills
[22:19] so an important part of debugging the
[22:22] that signal is can you recover it from
[22:25] the ultrasound and meeting you upshift
[22:28] the signal and then you want to
[22:30] demodulate it back to the audible
[22:34] um the original audible signal so this
[22:36] is an example
[22:38] um where you have your input and then
[22:41] you shift it to a high frequency and
[22:43] then you recover it back and that
[22:46] reversibility is important if you
[22:49] imagine defensing filtering it turns out
[22:51] the device itself
[22:53] when it at when you ask it a question
[22:55] it's sending the signal from that
[22:58] microphone to you could call it the
[23:01] mothership or a server in this case run
[23:04] by Alexa and at some point they
[23:05] demodulated and we'll show you where you
[23:08] can
[23:09] debug listening to what the server is
[23:12] receiving in an ultrasound case
[23:15] in fact that's what this is
[23:17] an important part of the paper is
[23:20] demonstration is to show not only are
[23:23] you triggering actions at the microphone
[23:25] but you're also triggering a Cascade of
[23:28] events on the server turns out Alexa for
[23:33] privacy reasons does at least to the
[23:36] user allow someone to review you the
[23:38] entire voice
[23:39] history of the device so today's
[23:42] commands or all history so it turns out
[23:46] on the server there's a voice profile so
[23:49] the device is actually trying to figure
[23:51] out who's speaking and then you can hit
[23:53] this play button uh on in this case we
[23:57] one of the commands was how do you spell
[23:58] apple and this was a successful
[24:02] ultrasound
[24:04] attack and the device responded by
[24:07] giving the answer APPL and it's very
[24:11] interesting to replay it when it's
[24:14] demodulated by the server and of course
[24:17] it it does sound as you would imagine
[24:21] similar when it shifted back into
[24:22] Audible
[24:25] so this debugging cycle of what what did
[24:29] we send what and what was received
[24:31] um kind of has this nice three panel
[24:33] you're looking at the the original input
[24:37] signal across all the Spectrum here
[24:40] um this is the waveform asking in a
[24:43] question and this is the spectrogram of
[24:46] of power so
[24:48] um the attack we're talking about is
[24:50] shifted all of this energy to high
[24:53] frequency you still see the carrier
[24:55] signal here there's no activity in the
[24:59] audible range and then at the actual
[25:02] microphone and the server
[25:04] you you do see the original signal in
[25:08] some form or another here and all the
[25:10] power has been remapped into audible
[25:14] um and at this point is actionable
[25:17] this is another another version that
[25:19] kind of lines all these four pieces up
[25:22] and so you have your
[25:26] if you start here
[25:29] um you you have your uh your headphone
[25:32] uh this I guess is from the speaker to
[25:36] our modification of the signal to the
[25:40] demodulated version on the device to the
[25:43] demodulated spoken version on the server
[25:46] in both waveform inspector branding and
[25:49] so it gives a kind of a nice view of the
[25:52] whole ecosystem associated with this
[25:54] inaudible command
[25:58] um and so we wanted to map this to a
[26:02] whole scenario of attacks and this is
[26:04] just one of them that we used within the
[26:06] paper to illustrate the potential of
[26:09] this kind of
[26:11] um cyber security issue
[26:14] um and we walked it through various
[26:16] stages in this case if you're talking
[26:18] about one device broadcasting to many
[26:21] you can embed this ultrasound signal in
[26:24] another signal so it can broadcast from
[26:27] for example a public announcer a PA
[26:29] system at a stadium in the silent
[26:33] section you could trigger all the
[26:34] devices in a stadium that was a scenario
[26:37] that was always interesting that would
[26:39] be the extreme of a Trojan attack on say
[26:42] a hundred thousand devices at a football
[26:45] stadium the other one is to embed it in
[26:49] a viral video
[26:51] um say a tick tock video or a YouTube
[26:53] video and the ultrasound signal is in a
[26:57] Island section either at the beginning
[26:58] the middle or end of that broadcast and
[27:01] you would randomly trigger
[27:03] some action on the other side there is a
[27:07] kind of timing element to that these
[27:10] devices don't typically there's a
[27:13] there's a narrow gap between the Wake
[27:15] word where you say Alexa and and the
[27:17] command and so you have to you have to
[27:19] get all of that kind of ride
[27:22] we did trigger this in our own code
[27:24] using python which gives you the ability
[27:27] to make it not only through
[27:30] text-to-speech but also through many
[27:33] many Downstream analytics we were able
[27:35] to run on the attack and defend
[27:40] um so you want to you really want to pay
[27:42] attention to different ways you would
[27:43] want to defend this kind of attack and
[27:46] we offer kind of uh five different broad
[27:50] categories you could Shield the device
[27:52] and these devices have a geometric
[27:55] sensitivity so for example
[27:58] um they don't respond well in a highly
[28:01] reflective environment which is a you
[28:04] know a corner with sharp surfaces like a
[28:06] shelf so you could design devices that
[28:09] potentially could acoustically Shield
[28:11] you an obvious thing is to frequency
[28:14] filter
[28:15] uh high frequency if it's inaudible you
[28:19] shouldn't broadcast it
[28:22] um we think the defender has a number of
[28:25] machine learning techniques
[28:27] um which some of which we've already
[28:29] developed to classify is this likely an
[28:31] ultrasound attack or not is there enough
[28:34] energy in the two different windows that
[28:37] you saw and um obviously just like the
[28:40] internet if you're on Amazon's device or
[28:43] Amazon's website or app Apple's website
[28:47] with Siri
[28:48] user authentication is an obvious
[28:50] Gateway that you would want particularly
[28:53] for executing sensitive actions so
[28:56] um
[28:57] these devices probably have come on so
[29:00] strong in the last two to three years
[29:02] and people are comfortable in in the
[29:05] sort of privacy of their home without
[29:06] authentication
[29:08] um but it's certainly possible to
[29:10] imagine
[29:12] um devious things happening and of
[29:13] course the real challenge we might
[29:15] mentioned in the paper is this is a
[29:17] distributed Network and many of these
[29:19] devices may not
[29:21] have the ability to regularly have
[29:24] security updates for example a
[29:26] thermostat
[29:27] and device level up security updates may
[29:31] not have Hardware associated with for
[29:33] example adjusting the microphone
[29:37] um and so this is in the appendix of the
[29:39] paper we go through the full
[29:41] um spectrum of attack techniques uh we
[29:45] map it to known attacks and different
[29:48] ways to to defend them and whether they
[29:51] would be all of these cases so lateral
[29:54] movement from device to device ways to
[29:57] get command and control and ways to
[29:59] exfiltrate data would be all stages of a
[30:02] Cyber attack so for future work we want
[30:04] to build on this one-to-many concept
[30:07] there are so many different network
[30:10] configurations to consider even in a
[30:13] one-to-one device there's many different
[30:15] so that would be kind of the broad
[30:18] configuration there's also a deep
[30:20] configuration meaning once an attacker
[30:23] has control of the device you can Bridge
[30:26] it to deeper and deeper skills through
[30:29] task chaining and that was kind of like
[30:31] the example we showed earlier where a
[30:33] simple cough leads to a call to the
[30:36] doctor or a purchase of cough drops or
[30:39] um
[30:41] or even even a food recipe we hope to
[30:44] get more into the physics of these
[30:46] microphones how is that non-linear
[30:49] uh gain being modulated and demodulated
[30:52] and so we have some examples going on
[30:55] now of small devices that mimic these
[30:58] that allow us to run more Diagnostics on
[31:01] the specific microphone we want to look
[31:04] at the what I would call the identity
[31:06] manager aspect and the scale of it so
[31:09] we've run in our example
[31:12] several runs of 50 different commands
[31:14] you can imagine 500 different commands
[31:16] under different profiles so for example
[31:19] a child's voice a woman's voice a gender
[31:22] or an age difference so that's the text
[31:25] to speech and clearly if we're
[31:28] succeeding 84 percent of the time we
[31:31] want to look at sensitivity to what
[31:33] makes it the geometry I've mentioned the
[31:35] proximity this is typically a pretty
[31:38] close up attack so the in the case of
[31:41] two devices you know the the ultrasound
[31:44] needs to be close to one device and so
[31:47] the obvious thing is digital signal
[31:49] processing so with that I will turn it
[31:52] back to the floor and I appreciate your
[31:54] attention thank you

Microphone

Abstract

Voice Control Systems (VCSs) offer a convenient interface
for issuing voice commands to smart devices. However, VCS
security has yet to be adequately understood and addressed as
evidenced by the presence of two classes of attacks: (i) inaudi-
ble attacks, which can be waged when the attacker and the
victim are in proximity to each other; and (ii) audible attacks,
which can be waged remotely by embedding attack signals
into audios. In this paper, we introduce a new class of at-
tacks, dubbed near-ultrasound inaudible trojan (NUIT). NUIT
attacks achieve the best of the two classes of attacks men-
tioned above: they are inaudible and can be waged remotely.
Moreover, NUIT attacks can achieve end-to-end unnoticeabil-
ity, which is important but has not been paid due attention
in the literature. Another feature of NUIT attacks is that they
exploit victim speakers to attack victim microphones and their
associated VCSs, meaning the attacker does not need to use
any special speaker. We demonstrate the feasibility of NUIT
attacks and propose an effective defense against them.

1 Introduction

Voice Control Systems (VCSs) are widely used in smart de-
vices, especially those which do not have keyboards, includ-
ing smartphones and smart home devices such as iPhone and
Alexa. VCSs offer a great deal of convenience by allowing
users or owners to use voice commands to activate and op-
erate VCS devices, such as asking iPhone to make phone
calls or send text messages when driving, or asking Alexa to
play music or control other devices (e.g., smart home devices
including locks). This is made possible by advancements in
speech recognition, which uses artificial intelligence/machine
learning (AI/ML) techniques to recognize voice commands.
Like any new technology, the security of VCS devices has
yet to be thoroughly analyzed. A body of existing literature
proposed the two classes of attacks discussed below.

One class of attacks uses inaudible voice commands to
attack VCS devices (e.g., smart phones) [1–4]. These attacks

are stealthy because the attack signals are inaudible to hu-
mans but can be understood by VCS devices. For example,
the DolphinAttack [2] and its siblings [1, 3] modulate audi-
ble voice commands into inaudible ultrasound signals, which
are then used to attack VCS devices. These attacks exploit
a physical property of VCS devices, known as microphone
nonlinearity, which basically says that when the input sig-
nal’s sound pressure level is high, a microphone can generate
unexpected frequency components [1]. For technical reasons,
these attacks can only be waged from a short distance between
the attack device and the victim device, despite efforts at en-
larging the distance [4]. In addition to ultrasound, inaudible
attacks can also exploit laser technology [5].

Another class of attacks hides attack commands into some
audible carrier audio (e.g., music). Two examples are Com-
manderSong [6] and Metaphor [7]. Unlike the preceding class
of attacks, these attacks do not require the attacker-victim
proximity assumption because they can be waged remotely,
which will be referred to as remote capability hereafter. How-
ever, the requirement of audible base media (e.g. music) limits
the attack to only non-silent attack scenarios, rendering these
attacks noticeable by careful users especially when they are
in a quiet environment.

In this paper, we propose a new class of attacks, which
modulate voice commands into near-ultrasound inaudible
signals and embed these signals into an appropriate carrier
(e.g. app, website or video); this is similar to embedding a
Trojan Horse into an innocent program. We call the new fam-
ily of attacks near-ultrasound inaudible trojan (NUIT).1 When
audio with embedded NUIT signals is replayed, the NUIT sig-
nals will attack a victim VCS device, which is also similar to
how Trojan Horses are activated to wage attacks. From an at-
tacker’s point of view, NUIT attacks have three salient features.
(i) They achieve the best of the two known classes of attacks
mentioned above, by simultaneously entertaining inaudibility
(as NUIT signals are inaudible) and remote capability (as the
attacker can wage attacks remotely). (ii) They can achieve

1“Nuit” is a French word which means “night” in English.

end-to-end unnoticeability, which we define as inaudible at-
tack signals and silent responses. This is important because
the response of a smart device to an inaudible command may
be audible and thus may alert the victim about the presence of
attacks. (iii) They do not require the attacker to use any spe-
cial hardware; instead, the attacker exploits victim speakers
to attack victim microphones and their associated VCSs.

(a) Illustration of NUIT-1.

(b) Illustration of NUIT-2.
Figure 1: Illustration of two instances of the NUIT attack.

NUIT has two instances, which differ in whether the victim
speaker and the victim microphone are on the same device or
not. In the instance dubbed NUIT-1 and illustrated in Figure
1a, the victim device runs an app, which secretly replays
audio with embedded NUIT signals; as a consequence, the
NUIT signals attack the microphone and the associated VCS
on the same device to open a smart lock. In the instance
dubbed NUIT-2 and illustrated in Figure 1b, the victim uses
a computer to browse a website, which replays audio with
embedded NUIT signals to attack the microphone and Alexa
on a different device to open a smart lock.
Challenges in Realizing NUIT Attacks. To wage NUIT at-
tacks, we must tackle three challenges. The first challenge
is to make the NUIT attacks (i.e., both NUIT-1 and NUIT-2)
able to exploit the limited bandwidth of Commercial-Off-
The-Shelf (COTS) speakers to attack victim microphones and
their associated VCSs. This challenge has no counterpart in
previous inaudible attacks where the attacker uses special
speakers; by contrast, NUIT exploits victims’ COTS speakers.
This challenge also has no counterpart in previous remote
attacks because their attack signals are audible; by contrast,
NUIT signals are inaudible. We address this challenge by us-
ing the Single-sideband Amplitude Modulation (SSB-AM)
scheme [8, pp. 30], while adapting its demodulation method
to leverage the microphone nonlinearity. It is worth mention-

ing that a windowed NUIT signal contains burst noise caused
by spectral leakage; this can be addressed by leveraging the
Tukey window [9] (cf. Appendix C).

The second challenge, which is relevant to the NUIT-1 at-
tack (but not the NUIT-2 attack), is to embed NUIT signals into
the limited time window imposed by the fact that VCS devices
immediately mute, or lower the volume of, their speakers after
processing the activation keyword (e.g., “Hey Siri” for Apple
devices); this design is intended to make devices able to hear
the subsequent action commands from the user clearly (e.g.,
“Open the door”) without interference from the device’s own
speaker. This matter is relevant because when the speaker is
muted or turned down, it cannot be exploited to wage NUIT-1
attacks. We address this challenge by identifying and exploit-
ing the reaction time window.

The third challenge is to make the NUIT attacks (i.e.,
both NUIT-1 and NUIT-2) achieve end-to-end unnoticeabil-
ity, which we define as inaudible attack signals and silent
responses. This is important because VCSs’ responses to
voice commands can be audible (e.g., Siri would respond
to the inaudible command “open the door” with an audible
response like “ok, the door is open”), thus alerting the vic-
tim about the presence of attacks. This issue is inherent to
the system design of VCS devices, and does not appear to
have been mentioned in the literature until very recently [10],
where the authors suggest that the attacker may send an in-
audible command (e.g. “turn the volume to 3”) to turn down
the victim device’s speaker to an inaudible level to make the
VCS’ response unnoticeable. This method can be applied
to make NUIT-2 achieve end-to-end unnoticeability. How-
ever, this method fails to make NUIT-1 achieve end-to-end
unnoticeability because NUIT-1 exploits a victim’s speaker
to attack the same victim’s microphone and VCS on the same
device; for many VCS devices, turning down their speaker
also makes NUIT-1 fail. We address this challenge by testing
VCSs’ response mechanism to find that NUIT-1 can attack
Siri devices while achieving end-to-end unnoticeability.
Our Contributions. We make four contributions. First, we
introduce a new class of attacks against VCS devices, dubbed
NUIT, which can simultaneously achieve the inaudibility of
attack signals, the remote capability for waging attacks, and
the silent response as devices permit. NUIT has two instances:
NUIT-1 exploits a victim’s speaker to attack the same victim’s
microphone and VCS on the same device; NUIT-2 exploits
a victim’s speaker to attack the same victim’s microphone
and VCS on a different device. Second, we demonstrate the
feasibility of NUIT, by addressing the three challenges men-
tioned above. The ideas we use to address these challenges
may be of independent value, such as the adaptation of the
SSB-AM modulation to achieve inaudibility. Mathematical
reasoning of SSB-AM demodulation to leverage the micro-
phone nonlinearity. To help understand NUIT, we make our
attack demo videos available at [11]. Third, we find that the
NUIT attacks fail to attack iPhone 6 Plus, which reminds us

that the DolphinAttack also fails to attack iPhone 6 Plus [2].
Since there is no explanation for why iPhone 6 Plus can resist
these attacks, we conduct a study and find the reason is that its
microphone has weak nonlinearity, which is caused by its low
gain audio amplifier. This does not means that using micro-
phones with weak nonlinearity is a good strategy to harden the
security of devices, because it also hurts the legit use of VCSs.
Fourth, since known defenses have limitations in defending
against NUIT, we propose a single-factor software-based de-
fense, which leverages the attack’s success to counter it, as
follows: When the attack succeeds, the victim microphone
must have detected and recognized the embedded NUIT sig-
nals at a near-ultrasound frequency; this capability can be
leveraged to detect NUIT. We use simulation to evaluate our
defense because the VCS devices available to us do not have
open-source code or interfaces we can use. Simulation results
show that it has zero false-positives and zero false-negatives,
which is attributed to the leverage of physical properties of
VCS devices.
Other Scenarios of NUIT Attacks. There are many ways to
wage NUIT attacks than what is illustrated in Figure 1, such as
the following. (i) NUIT can be waged in a standalone fashion—
the attacker uses its own COTS speaker to attack a victim’s
microphone and VCS, as in the case of the DolphinAttack [2]
and its siblings. (ii) Figure 1b illustrates that the NUIT-2
attacker can exploit victim A’s speaker on one device to attack
A’s microphone on another device. This attacker could exploit
A’s speaker to attack B’s microphone, for example when A
and B sit next to each other.
Ethical Issues. Since NUIT exploits physical properties of
COTS speakers and microphones, rather than software vul-
nerabilities, spreading awareness is a sensitive matter. This is
similar to what was encountered by the DolphinAttack [2] and
its siblings [5, 10, 12]. Nevertheless, our attack experiments
are conducted in controlled environments against our own
devices and pose no threats to others.

Prior Studies Related to Near-Ultrasound Signals. In the
literature, near-ultrasound signals have been used to synchro-
nize TV shows with smart device app services [13], facilitate
two-factor authentication [14], and enable wearable medical
devices communications [15], medium-range (25m) commu-
nications [16], and high-throughput communications between
COTS devices [17]. By contrast, NUIT is the first to exploit

near-ultrasound signals to wage attacks against VCS devices.

Prior Studies on Attacks Related to NUIT. As mentioned
above, we divide previous attacks related to NUIT into two
classes: inaudible vs. audible. Table 2 compares previous
attacks and NUIT. Previous inaudible attacks carry attack
signals via electromagnetic waves [18, 19], laser beams [5],
or ultrasound waves [1, 2, 4, 10, 12] (through air while as-
suming line-of-sight or LOS [1, 2, 4], or through solid mate-
rial [10]). Previous audible attacks are incomprehensible to
humans [6, 7, 20, 21]. But attacks in [20, 21] sound like ran-
dom noises to humans and may alert the presence of attacks.
CommanderSong [6] and Metaphoer [7] require audio (e.g.
music) to hide the command, thus cannot achieve inaudibility.
These attacks exploit either the difference in computer vs. hu-
man speech recognition systems [20], or adversarial examples
against computer speech recognition systems [6, 7, 21].

Among the attacks reviewed above, CommanderSong [6]
is closely related to NUIT because they both can be waged
remotely by embedding attack signals into some audible car-
rier media (e.g., video/audio). However, two differences make
NUIT more stealthy. (i) NUIT is not noticeable to the victim
user even in a quiet environment, owing to the use of inaudible
attack signals by design; whereas, CommanderSong attack
signals are audible noise-like signals by design. (ii) NUIT can
embed inaudible attack signals into a silent app or website, but
CommanderSong must use audible carrier media (e.g music).
Prior Studies on Defenses Related to NUIT. Known de-
fenses against inaudible attacks can be divided into two
categories: Single-factor defenses [2, 4, 10, 22] and Multi-
factor defenses [22–25]. Single-factor defenses can further
be divided into two sub-categories: hardware-based [22] vs.
software-based [2, 4, 10]. Hardware-based Single-factor de-
fenses (e.g. [22]) have the limitation that they require modi-
fication of device hardware, therefore fail to protect existing
devices on the market that don’t allow hardware modifica-
tion. Software-based Single-factor defenses [2, 4, 10] detect
“abnormal” behaviors in the frequency domain of commands
received from the mono microphone to detect attack signals,
which can be easily implemented on all existing devices via
a software update; our defense belongs to this type. How-

ever, as elaborated in Appendix D, existing defenses can be
evaded by a specially crafted attack signal (e.g. our SSB-AM
based NUIT signal). Instead of just using the mono micro-
phone, multi-factor defenses exploit additional sensors on
certain VCS devices, (e.g. motion sensors [23], microphone
array [24, 25], extra speakers [26]) to extract features in other
dimensions to detect whether the received command is legit or
not. These multi-factor defenses can defeat inaudible attacks
including NUIT, but have the limitation that the victim VCS
device must contain such additional sensors, and thus fail to
protect most existing devices without such sensors.

3 Preliminaries

VCS User-to-Device Authentication. A VCS has two main
components. The voice-capturing component is responsible
for capturing sound waves and digitizing them for further
processing. This component consists of a microphone, an
amplifier, a Low-Pass Filter (LPF), and an analog-to-digital
converter (ADC), where LPF often operates at the frequency
of 20kHz. The speech recognition component uses AI/ML to
detect a device-specific activation keyword (e.g., “Hey Siri"
for Apple, “Alexa” for Amazon, “Hey Google” for Google As-
sistants, and “Cortana” for Microsoft) and subsequent action
commands (e.g., “Call phone #123-4567"). A VCS constantly
listens for its activation keyword. We use the term voice com-
mands to accommodate both activation keywords and action
commands. A VCS uses voiceprint to authenticate the activa-
tion keyword, but we are not aware of any VCS device that
uses voiceprint to authenticate action commands.
VCS Response Mechanism and Its Implications. VCSs of-

ten respond to action commands with confirmations, which ap-
pear to depend on their comprehension of an action command.
For example, Siri would respond to the command "Open the
door" with a response "Your door is open". Since the response
to an inaudible action command may alert the presence of at-
tacks, the attacker would want to silence the response. We find
that Siri’s responses are controlled by a separate mechanism
rather than using the media volume, which makes it possible
to achieve silent responses and end-to-end unnoticeability.
However, Google Assistant, Cortana, and Alexa’s responses
use the same volume as their media volume, meaning that
the attacker cannot silence responses without jeopardizing the
success of NUIT attacks.

Audible Frequency Range. Human ears are most sensitive
to sound with a frequency between 2kHz and 5kHz and insen-
sitive to sound with a frequency higher than 16kHz [27, 28].
Sound with a frequency ≥ 16kHz is deemed high frequency
to humans [17]. In this paper, the attacker modulates human
voice commands in the frequency range 50Hz-6kHz [29]
to sound waves at the inaudible near-ultrasound frequency
between 16kHz and 22kHz.

Double Sideband and Amplitude Modulation (DSB-
AM) Is Not Sufficient for NUIT. COTS speakers have a
Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) with at least a sample
rate of 44.1kSa/s (Samples per second). According to the
Nyquist–Shannon Sampling Theorem [30], this means that the
audio output frequency of COTS speakers is upper bounded
at 22kHz. Since the minimum inaudible frequency is 16kHz,
the frequency range of COTS speakers that can be used to
wage inaudible attacks is 6kHz (i.e., 16kHz-22kHz), which is
the range that can be exploited in theory. This is confirmed
by our experiments as shown in Appendix A.

However, this 6kHz (i.e., 16kHz-22kHz) inaudible band-
width is too narrow for the DSB-AM modulation scheme,
which is used by previous inaudible attacks. This is because
DSB-AM signals require at least 12kHz bandwidth (see Ap-
pendix B for details), which cannot fit into the 6kHz inaudible
bandwidth of COTS speakers without causing audio leak-
age at the left sideband (i.e., frequency range 10kHz-16kHz),
making the attack audible as shown in Figure 2. This means
NUIT needs a different modulation scheme to accommodate
the 6kHz inaudible bandwidth of COTS speakers.

Figure 2: Illustrating why DSB-AM cannot be used in NUIT.

4 Threat Model

The attacker’s goal is to remotely exploit the speaker on a
victim device to inject voice commands as NUIT into the mi-
crophone and associated VCS on the same device (NUIT-1)
or on a different device (NUIT-2), without the victim user’s
notice during the delivery, invocation and execution of the
attack. To achieve end-to-end unnoticeability, we assume no
user interaction with the microphone device when NUIT is
waged, otherwise victims may be alerted by the presence of
attacks. For example, NUIT-1 can be waged by a malicious
app running in the background when the victim is sleeping.
Similarly, the microphone device is assumed not in use (re-
gardless of the speaker device) when waging NUIT-2. The
following requirements must be achieved for waging NUIT.
Phase 1. Stealthy Preparation. The attacker can embed
NUIT signals into some appropriate carrier without being
noticed. For example, the attacker can write a malicious app or
compromise an innocent app that can replay a NUIT audio, or
upload NUIT audio to social media platforms (e.g., YouTube).
Moreover, the attacker has a sample (or adversarial example)
of a victim user’s activation keyword when voiceprint-based
authentication is enforced. This is not difficult to achieve, as
assumed in previous attacks.
Phase 2. Remote Delivery. We assume that the attacker can
remotely deliver NUIT audio to a victim. For example, exploit-
ing social engineering means luring a victim to download and
install a malicious app that can replay malicious audio, or
victims visit a malicious website as mentioned above.
Phase 3. Inaudible Invocation. NUIT attacks can be invoked
inaudibly when (i) the downloaded maliciously app is au-
tomatically replaying a silent audio in the background (or
opened by the victim) and/or the maliciously website contain-
ing NUIT signals replaying a silent audio is visited by victims.
This silent setting contains no carrier audio noise, which has
never been achieved in previous studies. NUIT can also be au-
tomatically waged when victims are (ii) watching malicious
videos that contain carrier audio noise, which is similar to the
threat model of CommanderSong [6].
Phase 4. Unnoticeable Execution. The execution of the NUIT
attack achieves end-to-end unnoticeability, meaning that the
NUIT signals are inaudible and VCS responses are silent.

5 Addressing the Challenges

5.1 Addressing Challenge 1

One approach to addressing this challenge, namely making
NUIT able to exploit the 6kHz bandwidth of COTS speakers, is
to proceed in two steps. (i) Identify the minimum bandwidth
that can be used to activate victim VCSs. (ii) Modulate voice
commands into the inaudible frequency range of victim COTS
speakers while assuring successful demodulation.

5.1.1

Identifying the Minimum Activation Bandwidth

To make NUIT widely applicable, we consider four popular
VCS devices [31]: Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Assis-
tant, and Microsoft Cortana. To accommodate them simulta-
neously, we identify the minimum bandwidth that is needed
to activate them. For this purpose, we analyze their spectrum
by repeatedly replaying their activation keywords and increas-
ing the sample rate until they are activated. For example, we
replay “Hey Siri” starting at a sample rate of 8kSa/s (i.e., 8k
samples per second); if Siri is not activated, we try 12kSa/s,
16kSa/s, and so on, until Siri is activated. Experimental re-
sults show: Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Cortana all
require a sample rate of 8kSa/s for activation, but Siri requires
a sample rate of 12kSa/s. Thus, making NUIT applicable to
all these devices requires a minimum of 12kSa/s baseband
sample rate (i.e., 6kHz baseband bandwidth [30]).

5.1.2 SSB-AM: Leveraging Microphone Nonlinearity to
Cope with COTS Speaker Bandwidth Constraint

The attacker can use Single-Sideband Modulation-Amplitude
Modulation (SSB-AM) [8, pp. 124–132] to modulate voice
commands into the 6kHz bandwidth identified above.
SSB-AM Modulation. We briefly review the basic ideas
while please refer to [8, pp. 125–129] for derivation details.
The two forms of SSB-AM, namely the Upper Sideband Am-
plitude Modulation (USB-AM) signal, denoted by SUSBAM,
and the Lower Sideband Amplitude Modulation (LSB-AM)
signal, denoted by SLSBAM, can be expressed as:

SUSBAM(t) = (1 + v(t)) cos(2π f u
SLSBAM(t) = (1 + v(t)) cos(2π f l

c t) − ˆv(t) sin(2π f u
ct) + ˆv(t) sin(2π f l

c t),
ct),

(1)

(2)

where v(t) is the baseband voice command signal and ˆv(t) is
its Hilbert transform [8, pp. 82–83], and f u
c respectively
denote the carrier frequency for SUSBAM and SLSBAM.

c and f l

Now the question is: Should the attacker choose USB-AM
or LSB-AM to modulate voice commands? To make NUIT
inaudible, the attacker must assure that the spectrum mag-
nitude is always below the threshold of the human hearing
curve, which is illustrated in Figure 3. In theory, LSB-AM al-
lows the attacker to set the carrier in the ultrasound frequency
range (> 19kHz) to generate high-power NUIT signals (up to
80db SPL), while making NUIT inaudible. In practice, how-
ever, many COTS speakers have increasingly deteriorated
frequency responses going beyond 19kHz (see Appendix A).
This means that using LSB-AM would lead to a low attack
success rate for mobile devices. Although this can be com-
pensated by using a high-volume speaker, it does not apply to
most mobile devices. Thus, the attacker would use USB-AM
with carrier wave at frequency f u
c = 16kHz for most devices.
SSB-AM Demodulation. Now we discuss how SSB-AM
modulated NUIT signals can be demodulated by COTS micro-
phones. We focus on the demodulation of USB-AM signals,
while noting that the idea equally applies to LSB-AM.

Figure 3: Illustrating the hearing curve and how to make NUIT
signals inaudible for USB-AM and LSB-AM modulation.

time for VCSs to process the activation keyword. The design—
muting, or lowering the volume of, speakers after hearing the
activation keyword—is for making the microphone listen to
action commands without interference from the audio that is
replayed by the speaker. Because (i) VCS can only mute, or
lower the volume of, the speaker on the same device, and (ii)
NUIT exploits victim speakers to wage attacks, the reaction
time has one subtle yet important implication for NUIT-1,
which exploits the speaker to attack the microphone on the
same device, but not for NUIT-2 that exploits the speaker to
attack the microphone on a different device.

Figure 4: Illustration of SSB-AM demodulation.

Figure 4 illustrates the basic idea. When a microphone
receives the USB-AM signal SUSBAM(t) given by Eq. (1), it
generates the following output signal:

Sout = SUSBAM(t) + S2

USBAM(t),

(3)

where SUSBAM(t) does not contribute to the attack because
its frequency is above 16kHz (i.e., it is out of the speech fre-
quency range and thus ignored by the VCS). [But, this linear
term can be leveraged for defense as we will show later!]
Note that the quadratic term S2
USBAM(t) has three components:
a high-frequency 2 f u

a Direct Current (DC) component 1/2, and an audible com-
ponent sb(t) = 1
2 (v2(t) + 2v(t) + ˆv2(t)). The high-frequency
component is filtered by the Low-Pass Filter (LPF) of the mi-
crophone with a cut-off frequency of 20kHz because 2 f u
c =
32kHz > 20kHz. The DC component is filtered by the mi-
crophone’s capacitor. Thus, only the audible component sb(t)
and the linear component SUSBAM(t) can pass the microphone
filtering system. Moreover, only sb(t) contributes to the attack
because sb(t) contains the voice command signal v(t).

Insight 1 COTS microphones are not designed to demodulate
SSB-AM signals, but their nonlinearity happens to enable it.

5.2 Addressing Challenge 2

Understanding and Measuring the Reaction Time. The
concept of reaction time is inherent to all VCS devices. Upon
receiving the activation keyword, VCSs either mute their
speakers or lower their speakers’ volume to its minimum. The
reaction time is the interval between (i) when the activation
keyword is received and (ii) when the speaker is muted or its
volume is lowered. The reaction time is inevitable as it takes

Figure 5: Illustration of the injection of malicious action com-
mands within the reaction time window in the NUIT-1 attack.
For the VCSs that mute the speaker after the reaction time,
the attack cannot continue to exploit the muted speaker. Thus,
the attacker’s malicious voice commands must fit into the
reaction time window; otherwise, the attack will fail. For the
VCSs that lower the volume of the speaker after the reac-
tion time, the attack can continue to exploit the speaker but
may still fail (depending on the volume). To make NUIT-1
widely applicable, we propose always embedding action com-
mands into the reactive time window, regardless of whether
the speaker will be muted by the VCS, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 5. This explains why the reaction time imposes a hard
constraint on NUIT-1, but not NUIT-2.

Table 3 summarizes the minimum and maximum reaction
time observed among the 100 experiments we conducted with
each device. The minimum reaction time is 0.77 seconds.

Insight 2 To wage successful NUIT-1 attacks against Siri,
Google Assistant, Alexa and Cortana devices, malicious ac-
tion commands must not be longer than 0.77 seconds.

Exploiting the Reaction Time. In our experiment, we con-
sider the action commands listed in Table 4 within the reaction
time window of 0.77 seconds. These commands are useful to
the attacker. Experimental results show that NUIT-1 success-
fully injects all these commands within 0.77 seconds.

Insight 3 Many action commands can indeed fit into the re-
action time window to wage the NUIT-1 attack.

5.3 Addressing Challenge 3

Surfing attack [10] proposes sending inaudible action com-
mands to reduce Google Assistant’s response volume to Level
3 to prevent the response from being heard by the user before
proceeding with further attack. NUIT-2 attack can directly
adopt this method by first sending an action command “Turn
volume to 6%” to the target microphone device to make the
VCSs’ response unnoticeable, and then proceed with subse-
quent attacks. Such method cannot be adopted by NUIT-1
because for many VCS devices (e.g. Google Assistant, Cor-
tana, Alexa), lowering system volume also lowers NUIT-1
signal’s volume, making further attacks impossible.

Nevertheless, we found that Siri is an exception. Our in-
vestigation shows that for iPhone Siri devices, the volume
of the response and the volume of the media are separately
controlled. Thus, the attacker can use an action command to
mute Siri’s response without muting the subsequent NUIT-1
commands. A running example of the NUIT-1 Attack muting
Siri’s response is detailedly described in Section 6.1.

Insight 4 For NUIT-1 attacks, only Siri’s response can be
silenced to achieve an unnoticeable attack but not the others.

6 The NUIT Attack

How to Embed NUIT into Carriers? We mentioned that
NUIT signals need to be embedded into appropriate carriers
(e.g. app, website, videos). Based on carrier audio’s audibility,
the embedding strategies are different: (i) The carrier audio
itself is silent (i.e., blank or void), in which case NUIT signals
can be embedded anywhere in the carrier audio. Examples
of such carriers are apps and websites. (ii) The carrier audio
is audible but contains some silent segments that are silent,
dubbed silent segments for short, such as pauses in a speech
and intervals between music soundtracks. In this case, NUIT
signals should be embedded in the silent segments (other-
wise, the attack might fail because the NUIT signals will be
overwhelmed by the carrier audio). There are many ways
to identify such silent segments in given audio, such as ap-
pending such segments to the end. Since it is popular to edit
and share self-made audios, which may be associated with
videos, on social network platforms, this would be one effec-
tive method for waging the NUIT attack. Examples of such
carriers are YouTube videos. Note that the preceding attack

scenario (i) does not have a counterpart in the Commander-
Song attack [6] which uses audible carrier media, but (ii) is
indeed similar to the CommanderSong attack because both
use audible carrier media.

6.1 The NUIT-1 Attack

How Does the NUIT-1 Attack Work? At a high level, the
attacker uses SSB-AM to modulate the activation keyword
and malicious action command(s) into near-ultrasound sig-
nals, and then embeds these signals into some appropriate
carrier audio to obtain malicious audio, which executes the
attack when replayed. Details follow.
Phase 1: Preparation. This phase has four steps. (i) The at-
tacker needs to understand the target VCS devices, including
their reaction time and their response mechanism. (ii) The
attacker needs to assure that the activation keyword can pass
the voiceprint authentication of the target VCS devices that
enforce it (e.g., Siri). This is readily doable [2], while noting
that this is not needed for action commands because VCS
devices do not authenticate them. (iii) The attacker needs to
accommodate the limited bandwidth of COTS speakers, as-
sure inaudibility when modulating voice commands, assure
the voice commands can fit into a single reaction time window
for all the VCS devices, and assure a silent response. This can
be achieved by addressing Challenges 1-3 as shown above.
This leads to NUIT signals. (v) The attacker embeds NUIT sig-
nals into some appropriate carrier audio as mentioned above,
leading to malicious audio with embedded NUIT signals.
Phase 2: Delivery. The attacker uses social engineering to
lure users to install the malicious app, visit the malicious
website, or listen to the malicious audio.
Phases 3 and 4: Invocation and Execution. When a user
runs a malicious app, visits a malicious website, or watches
malicious videos, NUIT signals can attack the microphone on
the same device in an end-to-end unnoticeable fashion.
A Running Example of NUIT-1 Attacking Siri.
Phase 1: Preparation. (i) The attacker needs to know that
iPhone has two different volume controls for the response and
the media. (ii) This is assured in our own attack experiment
because we attack our own devices. (iii) In our attack experi-
ment, we use two example action commands that can fit into
a single action time window: one is “speak 6%” for lowering
Siri’s response volume to 6% to achieve end-to-end unnotice-
ability, and the other is "open the door" as the attack payload.
(iv) In our attack experiment, we use Matlab code, which is
our implementation of the SSB-AM modulation scheme, to
generate the near-ultrasound signals of the activation keyword
and the two action commands. This leads to two separate wav
files, one for each action command (following the activation
keyword). (v) In our attack experiment, we embed the NUIT
signal, namely the wav file into two carriers: one is with silent
audio (e.g. mobile app), in which case we embed it at an ar-
bitrary place; the other is normal audio of music, in which

case we append the wav file to the end of the audio. This leads
to four wav files of malicious audio as there are two action
commands and two carrier audios.
Phases 2-4: Delivery, Invocation, and Execution. In our
attack experiment, we replay each of the four malicious au-
dios to attack our own iPhone XR for ethical reasons. We
observe that the iPhone XR device executes the “open the
door” command with end-to-end unnoticeability as shown in
the demo video we post on the website.

ity because the attack cannot silence these devices’ audible
responses. Fourth, NUIT-1 and NUIT-2 fail to attack iPhone 6
plus. Note that the DolphinAttack also fails to attack iPhone
6 Plus [2], and the cause is not known. This prompts us to
investigate the cause of this phenomenon below.

6.2 The NUIT-2 Attack

How Does the NUIT-2 Attack Work? In this case, the
attacker exploits the speaker on one device of the victim to
attack the microphone and associated VCS on another device
of the victim. The attack is similar to NUIT-1, except for the
following. The attacker does not need to deal with the reaction
time (Challenge 2) and the response mechanism because they
have no effect on NUIT-2 (Challenge 3). The reaction time
has no effect because the first device’s speaker will not be
muted by the second device, assuming that the victim speaker
device uses no VCS or a different VCS than the VCS used
by the victim microphone device (i.e., an attack targeting
Siri does not affect Alexa as their activation keywords are
different).
A Running Example of NUIT-2 Exploiting iMac to At-
tack Google Assistant. In our attack experiment, the victim’s
first (speaker) device is an iMac 2020 desktop and the sec-
ond (target) device is an Android LG ThinkQ smartphone
using Google Assistant, while noting that NUIT-2 targeting
Google Assistant cannot compromise iMac. Since the phases
of NUIT-2 are similar to that of NUIT-1, we only highlight the
differences between them. In NUIT-2, the attacker has more
freedom in choosing action commands because the reaction
time has no effect. We use two similar commands to attack
Google Assistant, namely “turn the volume to 1" and “open
the door." The carrier audio is silent. We embed the malicious
audio into a webpage on our own iMac computer, which can-
not be accessed from any other computer (for ethical reasons).
When using the Chrome browser to visit this webpage, the
Android LG ThinkQ indeed opens a smart lock.

6.3 Devices Vulnerable to NUIT Attacks

Table 5 summarizes the tested devices according to our ex-
periments. We make the following observations. First, Ap-
ple iPhone X, XR and 8 are vulnerable to both NUIT-1 and
NUIT-2 with end-to-end unnoticeability. Second, some de-
vices are not vulnerable to NUIT-1. This can be attributed to
(i) the distance between the victim speaker and the victim
microphone, even on the same device, being too long to make
the attack succeed, and/or (ii) the speaker quality on the vic-
tim device is not good enough. Third, some devices cannot be
attacked by NUIT-1 or NUIT-2 with end-to-end unnoticeabil-

Why Does NUIT Fail to Attack iPhone 6 Plus? It is known
that the nonlinear component in a microphone system is the
amplifier [4]. This hints that NUIT (and DolphinAttack when
waging common attack signals [2]) fail to attack iPhone 6
Plus because it has a low-gain amplifier, which has a weak
nonlinearity that cannot be exploited to wage these inaudible
attacks. To see this, let’s recall that generally speaking, when
the input voltage increases, the output voltage of an ampli-
fier does not increase beyond a cutoff voltage, known as the
saturation voltage denoted by Vsat . Moreover, the output is
linear to the input signal when the output voltage is small, but
does behave nonlinearly when the output voltage gets close to
Vsat . This nonlinear region is exploited by DolphinAttack and
NUIT to wage inaudible attacks. We suspect that these attacks
are successful against devices including iPhone X, XR, and 8
because these devices use a high-gain amplifier, and that these
attacks fail to attack iPhone 6 Plus because it uses a low-gain
amplifier, which makes it hard to exploit the nonlinear region
to make the attacks succeed. This is plausible because when
the input is at a common level, a low-gain amplifier usually
generates a small output voltage, which is far below Vsat and
thus makes the output linear to the input.

To validate the preceding discussion, we conduct experi-
ments to compare the amplifier transfer curve of iPhone 6
Plus and iPhone X. The experiments are conducted by using
a Vifa speaker [32] to send 18kHz sinusoidal acoustic sig-
nals at different decibel levels to the front microphone of both
phones and analyzing their output voltage in the recorded files.
For each phone, we send input sound pressure level (SPL)
from 60 dB to 130 dB with an interval of 5dB, and record
the output maximum voltage for each input. Figure 6 depicts
the results, where the x-axis is the input 18kHz signal sound
in a specific decibel, and the y-axis is the output voltage in

controlled from a distance of over 5 m. iPhone 6 Plus’ poor
Siri usability may be the reason why Apple switches to a
high-gain amplifier in the later version of iPhones (e.g. 8, X,
XR, 13 mini). The experiment video is available on our Demo
website [11].

Insight 5 Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa and Cortana are vul-
nerable to NUIT attacks, but at different degrees. NUIT (and
DolphinAttack with common input) fail to attack iPhone 6
Plus because their microphones use a low-gain amplifier.

7 Analyzing the Effectiveness of NUIT

We analyze the impact of the following four factors on the
effectiveness of NUIT-1: (i) the action command language,
because one action command’s lengths are various in different
languages (e.g., English vs. French) that may fit into the reac-
tive time window in one case but not another; (ii) the audio
file format, because formats impacts sound qualities; (iii) the
background noise, because it is often present in practice and
should be tolerated (i.e., an attack assuming no background
noise is not practical); and (iv) the carrier media audio vol-
ume, which may affect the location where the NUIT signals
should be embedded. Since the notion of reaction time win-
dow doesn’t apply to NUIT-2, there is no need to analyze (i)
for NUIT-2. This means we only need to analyze the impact

of (ii)-(iv) on the effectiveness of NUIT-2. In addition, we
consider the following two factors that are unique to NUIT-2:
(v) the directionality of the victim microphone to the victim
speaker, because it can affect the successful rate when the
victim has a different arrangement of device direction; and
(vi) the distance between the victim microphone and the vic-
tim speaker, which clearly can affect the attack success rate.
Table 7 summarizes the experimental settings.

Impact of Natural Language

decibels with Vsat normalized to 0dB. We observe that iPhone
X has a high-gain amplifier with a nonlinear region starting
at 73dB, whereas the output of iPhone 6 Plus is linear until
reaching 115dB. This explains why a common decibel range
ultrasonic signal (75dB-80dB) can successfully attack iPhone
X but not iPhone 6 Plus. Moreover, the nonlinear region of
the low-gain iPhone 6 Plus amplifier cannot be exploited un-
less the input reaches or goes above 115dB. This justifies the
experiments in DolphinAttack [2] that iPhone 6 Plus can still
be successfully attacked after placing the attacker speaker at
a 2cm distance from the victim device when raising the attack
signals to 125dB.

Can We Use Microphones with a Low-gain Amplifier as
an Effective Defense? The preceding discussion may prompt
one to propose using microphones with a low-gain amplifier
as an effective defense. Unfortunately, this is not true because
such microphones require legit users to raise their voices to
command the VCS. For example, our experiments show that a
user cannot activate Siri from a reasonable distance (2 m) with
a soft tone (40 dB) on iPhone 6 Plus. Specifically, we measure
the activation rate (i.e., the success rate of activation) and the
recognition rate (i.e., the success rate of action commands) of
iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone X, and iPhone XR in normal operation
environments (i.e., no attacks). We use a Google Pixel phone
to replay a normal command “Hey Siri, turn down the volume”
to each device at varying distances on the same desk, at a
sound pressure level of 40 dB to mimic a human soft tone.
Table 6 compares their activation rate and recognition rate,
showing that iPhone 6 Plus fails to be controlled by a legit
user at a distance of 2 m; whereas, iPhone X and XR can be

because we are attacking our own device. Second, we pre-
pare Text-To-Speed generated audios of action commands in
these languages at 330 words per minute. We consider three
examples of action command (AC), which are summarized in
Table 8 as AC1, AC2 and AC3, respectively. for AC1, which is
“Call + phone number” in English and its equivalent in other
languages, we vary the length of the phone number, from 3
to 9 digits because the same command may succeed in some
languages but not others.

Table 9 summarizes the experimental results. We observe
that for AC1, NUIT-1 successfully calls 9-digit phone num-
bers in Chinese, 5-digit phone numbers in English, and 3-digit
phone numbers in Spanish and French. For AC2, NUIT-1 suc-
ceeds in all four languages because the AC2 audios have a
similar length (i.e. 0.6 seconds). For AC3, NUIT-1 fails with
Spanish commands but succeeds with the other languages.
This is because the audio of AC3 in Spanish is 2 seconds,
which is longer than reaction time of Siri (0.82 seconds) even
at 330 words per minute, but the audio of AC3 in the other
languages is at most 0.9 seconds.

Insight 6 The success of NUIT-1 depends on the language
because the same action command in different languages can
result in audios of different lengths, some of which can fit into
the reaction time window but others cannot.

7.1.2 Impact of Audio Format

Popular audio formats can be divided into two categories:
lossless vs. lossy. A lossless format stores raw audio with-
out any compression, offering the highest audio quality; two
examples are Waveform Audio File (wav) and Audio Inter-
change File Format (AIFF). A lossy format uses compression.
Three examples are: MPEG-1 Audio Layer III (mp3), which
loses certain components of sound beyond the human hearing
frequency range (>16kHz) [34]; Advanced Audio Coding
(aac), which has a higher audio quality than mp3 by using a
better compression algorithm; and Windows Media Audio
(wma), which is similar to mp3. We use the widely-used bitrate

of 128 kbps [34] to evaluate mp3, aac, and wma files.

Table 10 summarizes the experimental results. For Siri
devices, we observe that attacks leveraging lossless audio
files (wav and AIFF) succeed against all listed devices except
iPhone 6 Plus. Attacks leveraging lossy audio files (mp3 and
wma) always fail Siri devices because these lossy formats
cause the elimination of the near-ultrasound attack signals
(>16kHz). However, attacks leveraging the lossy aac audio
format always succeed against all devices except iPhone 6
Plus. For Google, Alexa, and Cortana devices, we observe
that the NUIT-1 attack always succeeds, even if the base audio
uses a lossy audio file format. The reason is that Google and
Alexa’s activation keywords require less bandwidth, which
can survive the high frequency loss by mp3 and wma.

Insight 7 For devices vulnerable to NUIT-1 attacks,
NUIT-1 attacks succeed when using lossless audio formats,
but may fail when using some lossy audio formats.

7.1.3

Impact of Background Noise

To evaluate the impact of background noise on the success of
NUIT-1, we use noise to mimic the environment of a bedroom,
office and cafe. The malicious audio is a 16-bit WAV file.
The background noise is some Gaussian White Noise from a
Samsung TV speaker in an anechoic chamber at 30dB, 60dB
and 70dB, respectively. The noise is generated by a Samsung
TV when the victim device replays the malicious audio with
embedded NUIT signals. We repeat the attack 100 times to
derive the successful rate of the attack (i.e., the percentage of
successful attacks over the total number of attacks).

Table 11 summarizes the experimental results. For the
NUIT-1 attack, we observe that the background noise mimick-
ing the bedroom (30-45dB) environment or office (55-65dB)
environment does not have an impact on the attack success
rate. However, the noise mimicking cafe environment (65-
75dB) causes it to lose effectiveness: 10% of the times the
activation keyword fails and 30% of the times the action com-
mand fails. The failure can be attributed to the low Signal-to-
Noise Rate (SNR), which disrupts the signal even though the
speaker and the microphone are on the same device.

Insight 8 The NUIT-1 attack can tolerate certain degrees
of background noises because of the short distance between
the victim speaker and the victim microphone, but starts to
fail when the background noise gets stronger.

7.1.4 Impact of Carrier Audio Volume

To evaluate this, we embed NUIT signals into the Gaussian
White Noise with sound pressure level −30dB, 0dB, 30dB
and 50dB, respectively. This leads to 5 malicious audio files.
We repeat each attack 100 times to derive the successful rate.
As shown in Table 12 for the NUIT-1 attack when the carrier
audio volume is above 0dB, its success rates of the activation
keyword and the action command drop from 100% to 80%
and 100% to 60%, respectively. This is because the high
volume combined with the close proximity between the victim
speaker and the victim microphone produces a strong Sound
Pressure Level (SPL) at the microphone. This triggers the
microphone’s Automatic Gain Control (AGC), suppressing
the NUIT-1 signal so that Siri cannot understand the command.
Moreover, the discrepancy between the 80% and the 60%
suggests that even when the activation keyword succeeds, the
following action command may fail.
Insight 9 The NUIT-1 attack fails when the attack signals

are mixed with carrier audio’s sound track.

7.2 Effectiveness of the NUIT-2 Attack

7.2.1

Impact of Audio Format

The experimental result is the same as NUIT-1 and thus
omitted. This is expected as there is little background noise
(<40dB). Thus, we can draw the same insight as Insight 6:
audio format significantly impacts NUIT-2’s success rate.

7.2.2

Impact of Background Noise

To evaluate the impact of background noise, we conduct the
same experiments as in the case of NUIT-1, with the differ-
ence that we use the NUIT-2 default settings. Experimental
results are also summarized in Table 11 for easier comparison.
We observe NUIT-2 is more significantly affected by the back-
ground noise, especially when the noise is loud, because the
speaker-microphone distance in the NUIT-1 attack (< 1cm)
is much smaller than that of NUIT-2 (25cm).

Insight 10 Background noise has a higher impact on the suc-
cess of the NUIT-2 attack than the NUIT-1 attack because
of the longer speaker-microphone distance in NUIT-2.

7.2.3

Impact of Directionality

Figure 7 shows how we hold the victim speaker device with
a phone holder, at coordinate (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0). In each ex-
periment, we change the position of the victim microphone
device, which is held by hand. Directionality is described by
two parameters: θ, which is the azimuthal angle [35]; and ϕ,
which is the polar angle [35]. We vary the (θ, ϕ) values to
observe how they affect the success of NUIT-2.

Table 13 summarizes the experimental results. We observe
that directionality does not have a significant impact on the
success rate of NUIT-2: for activation keyword, the attack
success rate is always 100%; for action command, the attack
success rate is at least 95%. This can be attributed to the
omni-directional nature of the near-ultrasound signals.

8 Defense

Security Requirements. We propose the following four se-
curity requirements for an ideal defense: (i) it detects attacks
with few false-positives and few false-negatives; (ii) it is
device-independent, meaning the defense can be implemented
on any type of modern VCS devices (i.e. mobile, wearable and
stationary devices) without modifying/adding existing hard-
ware (iii) it is robust against evasion; (iv) it is light-weight
and incurs minimal processing delay. As elaborated in Ap-
pendix D, known defenses against previous inaudible attacks
cannot be adapted to defeat NUIT. Note that requirement (ii)
mandates software solutions.
Our Defense. The basic idea is to leverage the success of
NUIT attacks to cope with themselves as follows: Whenever
the attack succeeds, the victim microphone VCS must have
already detected and recognized the embedded NUIT signal at
a near-ultrasound frequency; this capability can be leveraged
to detect the presence of NUIT because a legitimate activation
keyword or action command should not come from the high
frequency range (> 16kHz).

tionality parameters (θ, ϕ) as described in the text. “Cmd"

Insight 11 Directionality does not have a significant impact
on the success of the NUIT-2 attack because of the omnidi-
rectional transmission ability of sound.

7.2.4 Impact of Distance

To evaluate the impact of the distance between the victim
speaker device and the victim microphone device on the attack
success rate of NUIT-2, we vary the distance between them.
The experiment setting is the same as the directionality one,
except that we vary the distance between the speaker device
and the microphone device. We want to determine the effective
distance between the speaker device and the microphone
device below which the attack success rate is ≥80%.

Table 14 summarizes the experimental results, which show
that the effective distance depends on the power of the speaker.
For small mobile devices, the effective distance is small (<
10cm); for devices like laptops, desktops, TVs or car radio,
the effective distance can be longer. Moreover, the effective
distance of Alexa Echo, Google Home, and Cortana, which do
not authenticate activation keywords, is longer than that of Siri
and Google Phone Assistant, which authenticate activation
keywords. This is because the authentication mechanism does
not allow any significant distortion of activation keywords;
otherwise, it could be exploited to wage other attacks.

Figure 8: Basic idea for detecting NUIT.
Figure 8 highlights the techniques behind the defense. It
is based on the following similarity analysis, which is made
possible by the nonlinear demodulation, namely that the mi-
crophone system produces an inaudible near-ultrasound signal
consisting of two parts: the demodulated baseband (<8kHZ)
signal sb(t) and the high-frequency passband (>16kHz) sig-
nal sp(t). If sb(t) comes from sp(t), then there is a NUIT at-
tack; otherwise, there is no NUIT attack. In greater detail, the
defense first divides signal sb(t) into segments of fixed-length
Twin. The windowed commands are filtered by a Low-Pass
Filter (LPF) with a cut-off frequency 16kHz and a High-Pass
Filter (HPF) also with a cut-off frequency 16kHz. The sig-
nal passing the HPF has a high frequency (>16kHz) which
will be squared and compared with the baseband signal using
cross-correlation with coefficient R with

R =

Insight 12 The effective distance between the victim speaker
and the victim microphone in the NUIT-2 attack depends on
the power of the victim speaker.

A similarity threshold τ can be used such that |R| > τ means
that a NUIT attack is detected. This is because a high similarity
between the envelope of the high frequency component (>

16kHz) and the waveform of the baseband component (<
16kHz) will make the command shadowed from the high
frequency range, indicating the presence of attacks.
Defense Effectiveness Analysis. Since the defense is
software-based, it can be implemented on any existing device
without modifying or adding any hardware, satisfying require-
ment (ii). Since the attacker cannot decrease the similarity, the
defense is robust against evasion or satisfies requirement (iii).
The other security requirements are satisfied as evidenced by
the following experiment-based evaluation.

We record 300 instances of activation keywords for iPhone
XR, including 100 from a human at a distance of 5cm, 100
NUIT-1 signals from its speaker, and 100 NUIT-2 signals
from a Samsung S9 at a distance of 5cm. (These devices are
arbitrarily chosen because all microphones follow the same
nonlinearity principle.) For speech processing, Twin is 20ms-
40ms [36]; we choose 40ms to better capture low-frequency
characteristics [36]. We set τ = 0.55. The 200 malicious au-
dios and the 100 legit command audios are waged against
our defense in the setting mentioned in Section7. Figure 9
summarizes the experimental results, showing the defense
achieves zero false-positives and zero false-negatives, satisfy-
ing requirement (i). The defense is a light-weight, satisfying
requirement (iv). In summary, the defense satisfies all of the
four requirements mentioned above.

9 Limitation

The study has several limitations. (i) The inaudibility of NUIT
attacks is rooted in the inaudibility of near-ultrasound sig-
nals. However, some young people may be able to hear near-
ultrasound sound, meaning that NUIT may be audible to them.
Nevertheless, NUIT can attack most users. (ii) The success

false-negatives in 300 experiments, where τ = 0.55.

rate of NUIT would be affected by the quality of the victim
speakers as evidenced by our experiment that the LG Think
Q V35 speaker has a poor response above 16kHz and thus
cannot be exploited to wage the NUIT attack. (iii) For NUIT to
succeed, the victim speaker must be above a certain volume
level; otherwise, the attack will fail. (iv) The NUIT-1 end-to-
end unnoticeability (i.e., inaudible attack and silent device
response) is not universally true but depends on how the de-
vice response mechanism is implemented. (v) The NUIT-1
attack is inherently limited by the reaction time (< 1s), mak-
ing it impossible to inject long action commands that cannot
be split into multiple short commands. (vi) The NUIT-1 at-
tack fails to attack devices with a low-gain microphone (i.e.,
iPhone 6 Plus). (vii) The NUIT-2 attack requires a short dis-
tance between the victim speaker and the victim microphone,
especially for low-power speaker devices (e.g., smartphones.)
(viii) The NUIT-2 attack may fail when the victim’s speaker
device has the same VCS as the targeted microphone device,
because it may trigger NUIT-1 attack on the speaker device.

We have introduced NUIT, which is a new class of inaudible
attacks against VCSs and can be waged remotely. Unlike
previous inaudible attacks, NUIT exploits victim speakers to
attack victim microphones and associated VCSs. To realize
NUIT, we address three challenges and our ideas may be of
independent value. We demonstrate the feasibility of NUIT
and propose a novel and effective defense against NUIT. We
hope this study will inspire more research on VCS security,
for which the limitations of this study can be a starting point.

3 speakers, in terms of normalized sound pressure (with the
maximum amplitude set to 0dB). We observe that different
speakers have different high frequency responses. In partic-
ular, speakers can send near-ultrasound high frequency sig-
nals (16kHz-22kHz) with some deterioration when compared
with the audible frequency range (20Hz-16kHz), meaning
that NUIT can exploit the 6kHz (i.e., 16kHz-22kHz) to wage
inaudible attacks.

Appendix B Why Isn’t DSB-AM Applicable to

NUIT?

In order to explain why the inaudible airborne ultrasound
attacks [1, 2, 4] are not applicable to the setting of NUIT, we
first review how these attacks operate. They proceed in three
steps. (i) The attacker uses the DSB-AM scheme to modulate
audible voice commands (at a frequency <16kHz) to an in-
audible ultrasound frequency (i.e., ≥20kHz). The modulated
signals contain two sidebands with a total passband band-
width of 16kHz (i.e., one sideband needs 8kHz to attack VCS
devices). (ii) The attacker emits inaudible ultrasound signals
by using one or multiple (possibly an array of) ultrasonic
transducers, which are owned and operated by the attacker, to
the victim device’s microphone. (iii) After the victim device’s
microphone receives the ultrasound signal, the microphone
automatically demodulates the ultrasound signal back to voice
command signals to activate the VCS. This is made possible
by a physical property of microphones, known as nonlinearity,
which is an inherent physical property that has been exploited
by previous inaudible attacks and is also exploited by NUIT.
Details follow.

Modern VCS uses Micro-ElectroMechanical System
(MEMS) microphones to convert acoustic vibrations or sound
waves to electrical signals. When an incoming acoustic signal,
denoted by sin, is received by the membrane and capacitor, it is
transformed into a weak electrical signal, which is then ampli-
fied by a pre-amplifier module and fed into a Low-Pass Filter
(LPF). The LPF removes inaudible noises with frequency
> 20kHz and then sends the audible signal to an Analog-
to-Digital Converter (ADC). The ADC outputs a quantized
output signal, denoted by sout , which is to be processed by
VCS. Let A1 and A2 respectively denote the coefficients of

the linear term and the nonlinear terms. When the input signal
is amplified, the nonlinearity of the microphone cannot be
ignored [37, 38]. By omitting the higher-order terms whose
coefficients are close to 0 [37, 38], the output signal becomes

sout (t) ≈ A1sin(t) + A2s2

in(t),

where the term s2
in(t) contributes to the nonlinear demodula-
tion of the input signals that were modulated by DSB-AM.
Let v(t) denote the baseband signal (i.e., voice commands).
The DSB-AM modulated signal corresponding to an inaudi-
ble command sent by the ultrasonic transducer is expressed
as

sin(t) = (1 + v(t))cos(2π fct),

where fc denotes the ultrasonic carrier frequency (i.e., fc >
20kHz). After the microphone’s processing, the signal con-
tained in fc is filtered as mentioned above, meaning that the
demodulated signal received by the VCS is

sout (t) = A2(1 + 2v(t) + v(t)2)/2,

(4)

where the v(t) component contributes to VCS’ recognition of
sout as a legitimate voice command.

In summary, by taking advantage of a victim microphone’s
nonlinearity property, DSB-AM can be used to attack VCS
devices with a passband bandwidth of 16kHz.

Appendix C Eliminate Burst Noise

(d) Frequency spectrum of SUSBAM(t)TK(t).
Root Cause of Burst Noises. Raw NUIT signals may incur
burst noises if replayed on COTS speakers without smoothing
steps. This phenomenon is known as spectral leakage [39,
pp. 285]. A raw SSB-AM signal has two sharp steps at its
two ends, as illustrated in Figure 11. These steps form a time-
domain rectangle window winbase. A USB-AM signal with

c , namely sinc( f − f u

Since the frequency spectrum of winbase is a sample func-
tion sinc( f ) [8, pp. 30], the component winbasecos(2π f u
c t)
in Eq.(5) has a spectrum of a sampling function with the
center frequency raised to f u
c ). Since
f u
c = 16kHz in this paper, the left-side lobe of sinc( f − f u
c )
goes into the audible frequency range (< 16kHz), causing
audible burst noises.
Eliminating Burst Noises Caused by Spectral Leakage.
Having pinned down the root cause of burst noises, we pro-
pose eliminating them by suppressing the side lobe without
deforming the NUIT signal. For this purpose, we multiply the
modulated signal by a Tukey window TK, which is also known
as the cosine-tapered window [40], before embedding a NUIT
signal into a carrier audio SUSBAM(t)TK(t). Recall that
α (t − α

0 ≤ t < α/2
α/2 ≤ t ≤ 1 − α/2

for some 0 < α < 1 [40]. A larger α reduces more spectral
leakage, but requires a slower rolling-down (i.e., a longer
unmodulated part of the signal at each end). This means that
the attacker needs to make a trade-off between the length of
the unmodulated part of the signal and the spectral leakage:
an SSB-AM signal with long unmodulated parts at either end
may waste valuable time for injecting NUIT signals, but long
unmodulated parts make the Tukey window roll down more
slowly, reducing spectrum leakage. Our experiments show:

Insight 13 Multiplying the raw NUIT signal with Tukey Win-
dow and setting its α > 0.5 can eliminate burst noises.

Appendix D Why Are Known Defenses Inef-

fective against NUIT?

This section elaborates on why known defenses cannot defeat
NUIT. We divide known defenses into two categories: Multi-
factor defenses vs. Single-factor defenses.

D.1 Why Are Known Multi-factor Defenses In-

effective against NUIT?

At a high level, these defenses rely on the victim device’s other
hardware than the microphone (e.g. motion sensors [23], mi-
crophone array [24, 25], extra speakers [22]) to pick up the

voice commands’ features in the relevant domain (e.g. vibra-
tion spectrum [23], directionality [25], acoustic field distri-
bution [24], or user’s physical location [26]). These defenses
have the limitation that the victim VCS device must contain
such additional hardware, and are not applicable to devices
without such hardware, violating Security Requirement (ii)
specified in Section 8. That is, these defenses are ineffective
against NUIT attacks.

Specifically, Surface Vibration [23] extracts audio-induced
surface vibration features as an additional factor to defend
against audible/inaudible attacks. However, this defense re-
lies on motion sensors (e.g. accelerators, gyroscopes) to pick
up the surface vibration features, making this defense only
applicable to mobile devices and wearable devices, but not
stationary VCS devices without motion sensors (e.g. Google
Home, Alexa Echo). [24, 25] both use a microphone array to
capture the sound field and the acoustic attenuation rate to
detect attacks. However, these defenses rely on a microphone
array, which is not applicable to most mobile/wearable de-
vices that contain only one microphone (e.g., smart phone,
smart watch). [26] leverages network-connected speakers to
build a sonar-like system to detect the user’s AoA (angle of
arrival) for liveness detection. However, this sonar-like system
requires extra speakers.

D.2 Why Are Known Single-factor Defenses

Ineffective against NUIT?

We further divide single-factor defenses into two sub-
categories: hardware-based vs. software based.

Limitations of Hardware-based Single-factor Defenses.
[22] uses extra ultrasonic transducers to generate a guard
signal to actively cancel out the inaudible ultrasonic attack
signal. However, the guard signal generator is extra hardware
that is not equipped with most modern VCS devices. This
violates Security Requirements (ii) specified in Section 8.
That is, these defenses are ineffective against NUIT attacks.

Limitations of Software-based Single-factor Defenses. Ex-
isting software-based single-factor defenses detect “abnormal”
behavior in the frequency domain of audio received by a mi-
crophone to detect attack signals. These defenses satisfy the
following three Security Requirements specified in Section
8: (i), meaning few false-positives and few false-negative;
(ii); meaning achieving device-independence, and (iv); mean-
ing lightweight. However, these defenses can be evaded by
a crafty attacker, violating Security Requirement (iii). That
is, these defenses are ineffective against NUIT attacks. Details
follow.

The first approach to software-based single-factor defense
leverages speaker characteristics via the spectrum of single-
channel audio to detect the liveness of a command and thus
attack signals [41]. However, this approach fails to detect
attacks waged from good quality speakers with flat frequency

Figure 12: Experimental results explaining why the defense leveraging spectrum analysis cannot detect NUIT attacks, which
signals are modulated by SSB-AM. The experiments are conducted by using the activation keyword “Hey Siri" as an example.
(a) The spectrogram of the activation keyword from a human’s voice. (b) The spectrogram of the activation keyword from the
DSB-AM modulated ultrasonic attack signal. (c) The spectrogram of the SSB-AM modulated NUIT attack signal, which does not
contain the two features used by [2, 4, 10] (i.e., the sub-50Hz noise and the high frequency harmonics).

responses.

The second approach is to leverage microphone nonlinear-
ity. The basic idea is to find some unique properties that are
only possessed by demodulated DSB-AM signals through
microphone nonlinearity [2, 4, 10]. For example, one can dis-
tinguish legitimate commands from malicious ultrasound or
near-ultrasound commands by analyzing the distortion of
the demodulated signals from 500Hz to 1000Hz (High Fre-
quency component of speech signal) [2, 10], or by analyzing
the High Frequency (HF) component and the sub-50Hz com-
ponent of a speech signal at the same time [4]. However, a
crafty attacker can evade these defenses by removing such
distinct characteristics in the frequency domain, as mentioned
in [23]. Specifically, these defenses are only effective against
DSB-AM modulated attack signals, but not effective against
SSB-AM modulated attack signals. In what follows we exper-
imentally and mathematically show that this defense can be
evaded by NUIT.

Figure 12 compares the spectrum of the human voice with
that of DSB-AM modulated DolphinAttack signals and that
of NUIT-2 attack signals. In Figure 12, we also highlight the
two features that are exploited by the aforementioned defense:
the sub-50Hz noise occurring between 0.4-1.0 seconds and
the HF harmonics occurring between 0.8-1.2 seconds. We
observe that these two features are exhibited in the DolphinAt-
tack signal’s spectrogram (Figure 12b), but neither its coun-

terpart of the human voice nor its counterpart of NUIT signals.
This is because, as is given in section 5.1.2 NUIT signal has
nonlinear demodulation noise v2(t)+ ˆv2(t)
, which has smaller
spectrum energy than v2(t) , the noise of DolphineAttack
signal after nonlinear demodulation. This is further because
ˆv2(t) is the square of the Hilbert Transform of v(t), which can
cancel out the spectrum energy of v2(t) [8, pp. 82–91].

To summarize, we use Table 15 to compare the known de-
fenses discussed above and the one we propose, showing that
ours is advantageous since it does not require extra hardware
to implement the defense and it is also robust against evasion.

What is NUIT?

NUIT is a novel inaudible attack against voice assistants (Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, Cortana) that can be waged remotely through internet. Nuit  appears as a sound clip  in near-ultrasound frequency range (16kHz-20kHz), thus can be played on the victim's COTS speaker to attack the voice assistant  (i) on the same device (NUIT-1)；(ii) on victim's other devices (NUIT-2).

Note that Nuit2 is between two phones (Device 1: performs as the attacking device or the speaker. Device 2 is the victim device, which voice assistants are the NUIT2 attacks’ target)

appears in [USENIX Security Symposium 2023](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23)

> Abstract:This study investigates a primary inaudible attack vector on Amazon Alexa voice services using near ultrasound trojans and focuses on characterizing the attack surface and examining the practical implications of issuing inaudible voice commands. The research maps each attack vector to a tactic or technique from the MITRE ATT&CK matrix, covering enterprise, mobile, and Industrial Control System (ICS) frameworks. The experiment involved generating and surveying fifty near-ultrasonic audios to assess the attacks' effectiveness, with unprocessed commands having a 100% success rate and processed ones achieving a 58% overall success rate. This systematic approach stimulates previously unaddressed attack surfaces, ensuring comprehensive detection and attack design while pairing each ATT&CK Identifier with a tested defensive method, providing attack and defense tactics for prompt-response options. The main findings reveal that the attack method employs Single Upper Sideband Amplitude Modulation (SUSBAM) to generate near-ultrasonic audio from audible sources, transforming spoken commands into a frequency range beyond human-adult hearing. By eliminating the lower sideband, the design achieves a 6 kHz minimum from 16-22 kHz while remaining inaudible after transformation. The research investigates the one-to-many attack surface where a single device simultaneously triggers multiple actions or devices. Additionally, the study demonstrates the reversibility or demodulation of the inaudible signal, suggesting potential alerting methods and the possibility of embedding secret messages like audio steganography.
