# Improper handling of NTS cookie length that could crash the ntpd-rs server

High

[rnijveld](/rnijveld)
published
GHSA-qwhm-h7v3-mrjx
May 25, 2023

## Package

cargo

ntpd
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

>=0.3.0,<=0.3.2

## Patched versions

>=0.3.3

## Description

### Impact

ntpd-rs does not validate the length of NTS cookies in received NTP packets to the server. An attacker can crash the server by sending a specially crafted NTP packet containing a cookie shorter than what the server expects. The server also crashes when it is not configured to handle NTS packets.

ntpd-rs running purely as an ntp client is not affected.

### Patches

The issue was caused by improper slice indexing. The indexing operations were replaced by safer alternatives that do not crash the ntpd-rs server process but instead properly handle the error condition. A patch was released in version 0.3.3

### Workarounds

ntpd-rs running purely as an ntp client is not affected. By default, ntpd-rs packages are not configured to run as a server.

For machines where serving the time is required, there is no known workaround. Users are recommended to upgrade ntpd-rs as soon as possible.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
