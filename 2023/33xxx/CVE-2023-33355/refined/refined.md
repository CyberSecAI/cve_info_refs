The provided content is related to CVE-2023-33355.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An API endpoint in IceCMS does not require authentication.
- This API endpoint allows retrieval of user information using a `user_id`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure API Access:** The API endpoint lacks proper authentication mechanisms.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The API returns user details, including username, password, and email address, in plain text.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access to user data:** Attackers can obtain sensitive user information, including passwords, potentially leading to account compromise.
- **Privilege escalation:** Access to administrator credentials can grant full control over the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a request to the vulnerable API endpoint with a valid user_id.
- The request body includes the user_id and backend service address `macwk.cc/api`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the API endpoint URL which is `macwk.cc/api` based on the information, and be able to send HTTP requests to it.
- The attacker needs to have some knowledge of valid `user_id` values to be able to retrieve information on specific users.
