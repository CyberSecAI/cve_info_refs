- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Easy Captcha plugin for WordPress lacks proper access control mechanisms in a function, leading to the execution of privileged actions by unprivileged users. This falls under the category of "Broken Access Control."
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated user can perform higher-privileged actions. The specific impact varies, but it could potentially lead to unauthorized access, data modification, or other security breaches.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable function, without needing any authentication or authorization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs no prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
