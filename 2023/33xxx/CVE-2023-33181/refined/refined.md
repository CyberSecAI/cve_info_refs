Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-33181

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue where some API routes in Xibo CMS output a stack trace when called with missing or invalid parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information through stack traces. These traces reveal the directory structure on the server, which can be used by attackers to understand the system's layout.
- **Error Handling:** The application fails to handle errors gracefully, leading to the disclosure of internal details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain knowledge about the server's directory structure, potentially exposing sensitive information about the system's configuration, application locations and potentially other files and information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **API Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered by interacting with specific API routes using missing or invalid parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low-level access to the system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable API endpoints.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is described as "Moderate" severity by the Xibo and GitHub advisories.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Xibo CMS version 3.3.5.
- Claroty Research Team82 is credited with the discovery and responsible disclosure of the vulnerability.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 4.3/10 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N), indicating a low impact on confidentiality and no impact on integrity or availability.
