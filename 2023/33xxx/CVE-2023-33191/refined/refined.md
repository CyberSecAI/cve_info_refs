{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `validate.podSecurity` subrule in Kyverno versions v1.9.2 and v1.9.3 does not properly enforce the Seccomp control at the baseline level when using the `latest` version. The issue arises from how the `latest` version is handled, which causes the Seccomp control to not be evaluated correctly.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of the `latest` version in `validate.podSecurity` subrule."
    ],
    "impact": "Users may be unable to enforce the check for the Seccomp control at the baseline level when using a version value of `latest` leading to an unintended bypass of security controls.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the podSecurity subrule with `latest` version."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify Kyverno policies to set the `validate.podSecurity` subrule with a `version` value of `latest`."
