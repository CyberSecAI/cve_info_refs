The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the ChurchCRM application, specifically within the `GroupReports.php` page.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-controlled input within the `GroupReports.php` page. Specifically, the hidden parameters `GroupRole`, `ReportModel`, and `OnlyCart` are vulnerable to XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize or encode user-supplied input when rendering the page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Cookie/session hijacking:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript to steal user cookies or session tokens, allowing them to impersonate the victim.
- **Redirect to malicious webpage:** Attackers can redirect users to a malicious webpage, potentially leading to further compromise.
- **Download of malicious files:** Attackers can force the browser to download malicious files from their server.
- **Unintended browser actions:** Attackers can perform any other unintended actions within the user's browser context.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious JavaScript injected into the hidden parameters `GroupRole`, `ReportModel`, or `OnlyCart` of the `GroupReports.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to modify the hidden parameters `GroupRole`, `ReportModel`, or `OnlyCart` in the request to the `GroupReports.php` page. The specific method to change these parameters is not detailed, but it is implied that it is possible.
- Since these parameters are hidden, they would be modified client-side or through some kind of proxy or interceptor.
