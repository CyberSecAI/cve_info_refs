-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512
Advisory ID: SYSS-2023-016
Product: Gira KNX IP router
Manufacturer: Gira Giersiepen GmbH & Co. KG
Affected Version(s): 3.1.3683.0, 3.3.8.0
Tested Version(s): 3.1.3683.0, 3.3.8.0
Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)
Risk Level: Medium
Solution Status: Unknown
Manufacturer Notification: 2023-05-11
Solution Date: Unknown
Public Disclosure: 2023-06-28
CVE Reference: CVE-2023-33276
Author of Advisory: Marc Gessler, SySS GmbH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overview:
The Gira KNX/IP router is a connection device for KNX lines for data
transmission over the Internet Protocol.
The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):
> Connection of KNX lines with aid of data networks and use of the
Internet protocol (IP).
> Coupling of a KNX system together with the Gira HomeServer or
Gira FacilityServer.
> Filtering and forwarding of telegrams.
> Use as line or area coupler.
[...]
Due to insufficient validation of user-provided input, it is vulnerable
to cross-site scripting attacks.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vulnerability Details:
The web server interface of the product responds with a
"404 - Not Found" status code if a path is accessed that
does not exist. However, the value of the path is reflected
in the response. As the application will reflect the supplied
path without context-sensitive HTML encoding, it is vulnerable
to a reflective cross-site scripting attack.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proof of Concept (PoC):
Request:
GET /%3Cimg%20src=SySS%20onerror=alert(%22XSS\_GIRA\_KNX/IP-Router%22)%3E HTTP/1.1
Response:
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Server: ise GmbH HTTP-Server v2.0
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 63
/![](SySS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution:
Context-sensitive HTML encoding of user input before reflecting it back
can be used to prevent a successful reflected cross-site scripting
attack.

# Responsible Disclosure Policy

## Research and Responsibility

SySS GmbH deals with security issues in a responsible way. In the form of a security advisory we report security vulnerabilities which are not in products of our customers and which are not excluded from public disclosure due to contractual agreements with vendors.

The security advisory contains detailed information about the found vulnerability that allows the vendor to reproduce and further investigate the reported security issue. Vulnerabilities will be disclosed to the public if a solution was published by the vendor or 45 days after the initial report by the SySS GmbH, regardless of the vulnerability status, for example if there is a patch or workaround from the affected vendor. In well-founded exceptional cases, this standard procedure may not be followed and an alternative, adjusted publication schedule will be negotiated with the vendor.

The goal of our Responsible Disclosure Policy is, to weigh up the need of the public to know of security vulnerabilities against the vendor’s time to remedy all security issues effectively. The final publication schedule will be based on the best interests of the community overall, considering both positions. Before the responsible disclosure of a security vulnerability, the SySS GmbH allows vendors the opportunity to analyze reported security issues, to develop effective countermeasures, and to test them thoroughly.
