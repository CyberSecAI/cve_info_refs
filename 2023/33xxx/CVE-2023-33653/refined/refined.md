This blog post details multiple vulnerabilities in Sitecore 9.3, including those that lead to remote code execution (RCE) and authentication bypass. While the blog post mentions that CVEs have been claimed for these issues, it does not explicitly state that CVE-2023-33653 is one of them. However, the issues described could fall under the scope of a vulnerability related to Sitecore 9.3. Based on the information provided, here is a breakdown:

**Vulnerability 1: IIS Authorization Bypass to RCE**

*   **Root Cause:** The `Server.Execute` method in `ExecuteHandlerAction` allows redirection of execution to any file within the webroot without proper authorization checks.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Uncontrolled parameter in `Server.Execute`, leading to the ability to bypass IIS-level access controls.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure by accessing arbitrary files in the webroot.
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) by combining this with a Telerik deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-18935), achieved by leaking the `web.config` file and using its keys.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1.  Send a request to the API endpoint: `/api/sitecore/Sitecore.Mvc.DeviceSimulator.Controllers.SimulatorController,Sitecore.Mvc.DeviceSimulator.dll/Preview?previewPath=<path_to_file>`
    2.  Use `Server.Execute` to read arbitrary files in webroot, such as configuration backups
    3.  Use leaked configuration keys to exploit CVE-2019-18935 and achieve RCE.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  Unauthenticated attacker, network access to the web application

**Vulnerability 2: Unsafe Reflection**

*   **Root Cause:** The `/sitecore/shell/Invoke.aspx` page allows authenticated users to instantiate arbitrary classes and execute methods with string parameters using reflection.
*  **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Unsafe use of reflection that allows instantiation of arbitrary objects and invocation of arbitrary methods.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) by leveraging `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize` within Telerik UI components to achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1.  Authenticate to sitecore
    2.  Craft a POST request to `/sitecore/shell/Invoke.aspx` with the following parameters: `__OBJECT`:  `<ClassName>.set_<MethodName>("<payload>")`
    3. The payload is a serialized .NET object generated by ysoserial to execute code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Authenticated user.

**Vulnerability 3: EXM Boogaloo Authentication Bypass**

*   **Root Cause:** The email campaign module (EXM) allows a renderer user to be set on the `HttpContext` when accessing mailing list content via specific parameters, bypassing normal authentication.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**  Flawed logic in EXM that sets a user context based on email campaign parameters, allowing the bypass of authentication checks.
*  **Impact:** Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) by chaining this bypass with other vulnerabilities
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1. Send a request to the vulnerable `Preview` endpoint:
    `POST /api/sitecore/Sitecore.Mvc.DeviceSimulator.Controllers.SimulatorController,Sitecore.Mvc.DeviceSimulator.dll/Preview?ec_message_id=<message_id>&ec_id=<email_id>&previewPath=/sitecore/shell/Invoke.aspx`
    2. This bypasses the authentication check
    3. Leverage the Unsafe Reflection vulnerability to gain RCE
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Unauthenticated attacker. Needs knowledge of valid `ec_message_id` and `ec_id` parameters, likely obtained by subscribing to a mailing list

**Vulnerability 4: Authenticated RCE via ConvertWebControls Pipeline**

*   **Root Cause:** The `Sitecore.Pipelines.ConvertToRuntimeHtml.ConvertWebControls` pipeline processor uses `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize` on user-controlled data extracted from HTML elements, specifically the `value` attribute from HTML elements with an id that ends in "_inner".
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data via `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize`
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) when a crafted payload is processed by the pipeline.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1. Authenticated user sends a POST request to `/sitecore/shell/Applications/Content%20Manager/Execute.aspx?cmd=convert&mode=HTML`
    2. HTML containing crafted `scInlineControl` and the corresponding `*_inner` element with malicious base64 encoded serialized .NET object as the value attribute is sent.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Authenticated user
