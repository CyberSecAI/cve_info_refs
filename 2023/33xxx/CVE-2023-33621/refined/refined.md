- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The admin authentication token is passed through a GET parameter instead of the `Authorization` HTTP header when exporting the OpenVPN server config through the web GUI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inclusion of sensitive token in the query string of a GET request.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The token is more visible and has a greater chance of being stolen through various ways such as web requests and proxies logs, browser history and Referer headers. This could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can potentially obtain the token by monitoring web requests, logs or browser history, if a user exports the OpenVPN server config through the web GUI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to observe the network traffic or have access to logs or browser history of the user exporting the configuration. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target device.
