- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap buffer overflow due to insufficient boundary checks when copying data received from a DESFire card during key reading.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap buffer overflow vulnerability. The function that reads the DESFire card doesn't properly check the boundaries when copying the received data internally.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential remote code execution on the targeted device.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs when reading DESFire keys.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trigger the DESFire card reading function, likely requiring some level of physical or logical access to the device to present a card. The vulnerability is especially problematic if default DESFire keys are in use.
