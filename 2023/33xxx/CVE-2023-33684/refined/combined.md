#### Screen SFT DAB 600/C Authentication Bypass Account Creation Exploit

Title: Screen SFT DAB 600/C Authentication Bypass Account Creation Exploit

Advisory ID: [ZSL-2023-5771](ZSL-2023-5771.php)

Type: Local/Remote

Impact: Privilege Escalation, Security Bypass

Risk: (4/5)

Release Date: 13.05.2023
##### Summary

Screen's new radio DAB Transmitter is reaching the highest
technology level in both Digital Signal Processing and RF domain.
SFT DAB Series - Compact Radio DAB Transmitter - Air. Thanks to the
digital adaptive precorrection and configuatio flexibility, the Hot
Swap System technology, the compactness and the smart system design,
the SFT DAB are advanced transmitters. They support standards DAB,
DAB+ and T-DMB and are compatible with major headend brands.
##### Description

The application suffers from a weak session management that can
allow an attacker on the same network to bypass these controls by reusing
the same IP address assigned to the victim user (NAT) and exploit crucial
operations on the device itself. By abusing the IP address property that
is binded to the Session ID, one needs to await for such an established
session and issue unauthorized requests to the vulnerable API to manage
and/or manipulate the affected transmitter.
