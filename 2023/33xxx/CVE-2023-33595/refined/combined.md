Fix use-after-free in tokenizer.c

```
`tok_get_fstring_mode`: ensure that token in the f-string middle is properly decoded, i.e. `tok_nextc` doesn't return EOF with `tok->decoding_erred` set to 1

## Description

![@JohenanLi](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17058872?u=07801920ef72dff1c74a6edb44dbecdecd9bde0f&v=4&size=48)[JohenanLi](https://github.com/JohenanLi)opened [on Apr 25, 2023](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103824#issue-1682372017)
# Your environment

* CPython versions tested on: 3.12.0 alpha 7
* Operating system and architecture: ubuntu20.04.1,x86\_64
* Compiler flags: clang with ASAN and UBSAN instrument

# Bug description

The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) tool has detected multiple heap-use-after-free errors and a segmentation fault (SEGV) in the Python interpreter. The heap-use-after-free errors occurred in the ascii\_decode and unicode\_decode\_utf8 functions in the unicodeobject.c file, and the SEGV occurred in the tok\_backup function in the tokenizer.c file. Additionally, a memory leak was detected in the pystate.c file.

# Steps to reproduce

1. Compile Python with ASAN enabled: `./configure && make`
2. Run Python with ASAN enabled: `./python < poc_file`
3. The heap-use-after-free errors and SEGV should be detected and logged by ASAN.

# Expected behavior

No heap-use-after-free errors or SEGV should occur.

# Actual behavior

ASAN detected multiple heap-use-after-free errors and a SEGV, as well as a memory leak.

# Relevant logs and/or screenshots

The ASAN summary output is as follows:

```
AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free /src/cpython/Objects/unicodeobject.c:4474:28 in ascii_decode
AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free /src/cpython/Objects/unicodeobject.c:4506:28 in ascii_decode
AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free /src/cpython/Objects/unicodeobject.c:4483:32 in ascii_decode
AddressSanitizer: SEGV /src/cpython/Parser/tokenizer.c:1234:33 in tok_backup
AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free /src/cpython/Objects/unicodeobject.c:4526:37 in unicode_decode_utf8
AddressSanitizer: 3824 byte(s) leaked in 4 allocation(s).
AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free /src/cpython/Python/pystate.c:229:23 in bind_tstate
The full ASAN log can be found in the asan.log file.
