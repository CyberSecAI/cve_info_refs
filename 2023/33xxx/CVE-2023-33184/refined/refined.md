Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of favicon hosts within the Nextcloud Mail app's avatar endpoint. This allows an attacker to initiate Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Blind SSRF:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SSRF, meaning the attacker doesn't directly see the response from the server they are targeting.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-provided input related to favicon hosts, leading to the SSRF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Internal Network Scanning:** Attackers can send GET requests to services running on the same web server.
- **Potential Information Disclosure:** Although a "blind" SSRF, attackers can potentially gather information about internal services, even if they cannot directly see the responses to their requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Malicious Favicon Host:** The attacker crafts a malicious link or input that leads to the mail app making a request to an attacker-controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privilege:** The attacker requires only low privileges within the Nextcloud environment to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs some user interaction for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
- Patched versions are 3.0.2, 2.2.5, and 1.15.3.
- The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2023-33184, and the associated GitHub Security Advisory ID is GHSA-8gph-9895-w564.
