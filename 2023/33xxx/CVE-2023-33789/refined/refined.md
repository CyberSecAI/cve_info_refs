The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Netbox version 3.5.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the "Name" field when creating Contact Groups. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability in the "Create Contact Groups" functionality.
- Lack of input sanitization or output encoding when rendering the contact group name.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If an attacker successfully injects malicious JavaScript, they can compromise a victim's browser session. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacing the web page
    - Other malicious activities that can be performed via JavaScript execution

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious payload, which is then stored in the application's database when creating a contact group. The payload gets executed when a victim visits a page that displays this stored data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create contact groups in Netbox.
- The attacker needs to know the location where the injected payload will be displayed/rendered in order to be executed.
