Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Briar as described:

**Issue 1: Receiving invalid message would have caused app to exit**

*   **Root Cause:**  The application failed to handle messages that exceeded the maximum allowed length. Instead of discarding them, an incorrect error check caused the app to exit.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper input validation and error handling.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious user could prevent their contacts from using Briar by sending crafted, over-length messages. This effectively creates a denial-of-service (DoS) condition for the receiving users.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Sending a message with a length exceeding the maximum allowed limit.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send messages to their target contact.

**Issue 2: Message duplication in blogs, forums, and private groups**

*   **Root Cause:** The Briar application did not check for canonical serialization of the message body before deserializing it. This allowed an attacker to create different byte representations that would still deserialize to the same content, therefore passing the signature validation and creating duplicate messages.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of canonicalization and missing input validation during deserialization of message bodies.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious user could duplicate messages from other users in blogs, forums, and private groups. These duplicates would appear as separate messages with identical content and timestamps, which could lead to confusion and/or misinformation.
*  **Attack Vectors:**  Crafting a non-canonical representation of a message body that when deserialized, results in the same message. This would include techniques such as integer overflows in length fields, malformed UTF-8 strings and non-minimal integer encodings.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a member of the blog, forum or private group to be able to send the forged messages.

**Issue 3: Poorly designed cryptographic handshake (BHP)**

*   **Root Cause:** The Bramble Handshake Protocol (BHP) was not designed with full forward security. It lacked a Diffie-Hellman exchange between the ephemeral keys of both parties.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insufficient key exchange during the handshake, lacking forward secrecy properties.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** If an attacker eavesdropped on the connection during the handshake and later compromised both users' Briar accounts, they could decrypt network traffic between the users from the handshake to the account compromise. This is a theoretical vulnerability since eavesdropping on Tor connections is not achievable in practice.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1. Eavesdropping on a Tor connection during the initial handshake.
    2. Later compromising the long term handshake keys of both users involved in the handshake.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have compromised access to both parties long term handshake private keys, and also requires the ability to eavesdrop the Tor connection during the handshake.

**Additional notes:**

*   The report highlights that the third vulnerability was not exploitable due to an additional layer of encryption provided by the Tor network, but it was still fixed.
*   All three issues were addressed in Briar versions 1.4.22 and 1.5.3.
*   The researchers used the Tamarin prover to formally verify the protocols and discovered issues such as the lack of forward security in BHP and the potential for man-in-the-middle attacks due to the lack of out-of-band verification in contact exchange.
