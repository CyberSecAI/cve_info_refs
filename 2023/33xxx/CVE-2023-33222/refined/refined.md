- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of boundary checks when handling contactless cards. Specifically, a function used to retrieve additional information from the card fails to validate the size of the received data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to Remote Code Execution on the targeted device.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when handling contactless cards.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have physical access to the device. The attack is network-based, but since it's triggered by a specific card, it requires physical access to the reader.
