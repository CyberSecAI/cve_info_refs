The provided content is related to CVE-2023-33617.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Diagnostics -> Ping" functionality of the Parks FiberLink 210 device. Specifically, the device does not validate user-supplied input for the ping target address allowing for command injection via the pipe character `|`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **OS Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an OS command injection vulnerability. User-supplied input is concatenated with a ping command, and the combined string is executed by the system shell, allowing for arbitrary command execution.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The input validation mechanism is insufficient. The application fails to filter out special characters, specifically the pipe character (`|`), which can be used to chain multiple commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the vulnerable device. This can lead to various outcomes depending on the attacker's intent, including:
    - Information Disclosure: Stealing sensitive system information.
    - Denial of Service: Disabling the functionality of the device.
    - Remote Control: Establishing a backdoor to control the device remotely.
    - Lateral Movement: Using the compromised device as a pivot point to access other systems within the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the web interface of the Parks FiberLink 210 device.
- **Specifically the ping functionality:** The attack is performed by injecting commands into the target address field of the ping utility accessible via the admin interface.
- **HTTP POST Request:** A specifically crafted HTTP POST request is sent to the `/boaform/admin/formPing` endpoint. The `target_addr` parameter is manipulated to include the attacker's command using the pipe character `|`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the device's web interface.
- **Authentication:** The attacker must possess valid admin credentials to access the vulnerable ping functionality.
- **Vulnerable Device:** The targeted device must be a Parks FiberLink 210 running a vulnerable firmware version (confirmed for V2.1.14\_X000 and not fixed in V2.1.15\_X000).
