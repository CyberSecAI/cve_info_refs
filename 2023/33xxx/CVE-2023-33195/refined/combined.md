* Content tab menus now reveal when a tab contains validation errors, and invalid tabs’ menu options get the same warning icon treatment as inline tabs do. ([#12971](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12971))
* Selectize menus now expand upwards when there’s not ample space below them. ([#12976](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12976))
* Element index bulk action spinners are now centered on the viewport. ([#12972](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12972))
* All control panel errors are new presented via error notifications rather than browser alerts. ([#13024](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13024))
* The `up` command now sets its default `--isolated` option value to `true`, and no longer creates a redundant mutex lock.
* Added `craft\base\Element::EVENT_BEFORE_DEFINE_URL`. ([#13018](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13018))
* Added `craft\utilities\AssetIndexes::volumes()`.
* `craft\controllers\AssetIndexesController::actionStartIndexing()` now cross-references the selected volumes with those allowed by `craft\utilities\AssetIndexes::EVENT_LIST_VOLUMES` event handlers. ([#13039](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/13039), [#12819](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12819))
* Fixed a bug where Assets fields weren’t respecting their View Mode setting when viewing entry revisions. ([#12948](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12948))
* Fixed a bug where asset pagination was broken when there was more than 100 subfolders. ([#12969](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12969))
* Fixed a bug where entry index pages’ “Revision Notes” and “Last Edited By” columns weren’t getting populated for disabled entries. ([#12981](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12981))
* Fixed a bug where assets were getting relocated to the root volume folder when renamed. ([#12995](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12995))
* Fixed a bug where it wasn’t possible to preview entries on another domain when the system was offline. ([#12979](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12979))
* Fixed a bug where users were able to access volumes they didn’t have permission to view via Assets fields. ([#13006](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13006))
* Fixed a bug where zero-width spaces, invisible plus signs, and byte order marks weren’t getting stripped from sanitized asset filenames. ([#13022](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13022))
* Fixed a bug where the Plugin Store wasn’t accurately reporting installed plugins’ license statuses. ([#12986](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12986))
* Fixed a bug where the Plugin Store wasn’t handling 403 API responses for cart operations properly, once a cart had been handed off to Craft Console and assigned to an organization. ([#12916](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12916))
* Fixed a bug where `craft\helpers\FileHelper::absolutePath()` wasn’t treating Windows file paths beginning drive letters as absolute. ([craftcms/generator#16](https://github.com/craftcms/generator/issues/16))
* Fixed a bug where it wasn’t possible to sort Categories fields with “Maintain hierarchy” disabled. ([#10560](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/10560))
* Fixed a bug where selectize inputs didn’t have a minimum width. ([#12950](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12950))
* Fixed a bug where the wrong tab would appear to be initially selected after an autosave, if the selected tab had changed during the autosave. ([#12960](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12960))
* Fixed a bug where it wasn’t possible to add a Dropdown field without a blank option to a global set. ([#12965](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12965))
* Fixed a bug where automatically-added Matrix blocks (per the field’s Min Blocks setting) were getting discarded if no changes were made to them. ([#12973](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12973))
* Fixed an error that could occur when installing Craft with an existing project config, if any image transforms were defined that didn’t specify the `upscale` property.
* Fixed a bug where nested folders in asset search results weren’t showing their relative path.
* Fixed a bug where admin tables’ default delete icon title text wasn’t getting translated. ([#13030](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13030))
* Fixed a bug where it was possible to save a Local filesystem pointed at a system directory (e.g. the `templates/` or `vendor/` folders), which mitigates a potential RCE vulnerability.
* Fixed XSS vulnerabilities.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
