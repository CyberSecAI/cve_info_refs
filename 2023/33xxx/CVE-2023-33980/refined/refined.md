    "related": true,
    "summary": "The document discusses three vulnerabilities found in the Briar application by security researchers at ETH ZÃ¼rich. The vulnerabilities include a denial-of-service vulnerability, a message duplication vulnerability, and a cryptographic handshake vulnerability. Two of the issues were fixed in version 1.4.22 of Briar, and the third issue was fixed in version 1.5.3.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "name": "Denial-of-service via invalid messages",
        "description": "A malicious user could prevent their contacts from using Briar by sending messages longer than the maximum allowed length, causing the app to exit. The error check raised a different type of error, causing app exit instead of discarding the message.",
        "root_cause": "Improper error handling during message length check.",
         "impact": "Application crash, rendering the app unusable.",
        "attack_vector": "Sending a message exceeding the maximum allowed length.",
        "required_capabilities": "Ability to send messages to the victim."

      {
        "name": "Message Duplication in Blogs, Forums, and Private Groups",
       "description": "A malicious user could create duplicate messages with the same content and timestamps by exploiting non-canonical serialization. This allowed messages with different bodies but same content to be created.",
        "root_cause": "Lack of canonicalization check before deserialization of the message body.",
        "impact": "Confusion among users due to duplicate messages.",
       "attack_vector": "Crafting a non-canonical serialized message body.",
        "required_capabilities": "Insider in a group/forum/blog."
      },
       {
        "name": "Poorly designed cryptographic handshake (BHP)",
       "description": "The Bramble Handshake Protocol (BHP) had a design flaw where, if an attacker eavesdropped on the handshake and later compromised both users’ accounts, the attacker could decrypt past network traffic. This issue was not exploitable as Tor protected the connection from eavesdropping.",
        "root_cause": "Missing key exchange of ephemeral keys in the hash input.",
        "impact": "Potential decryption of past traffic if eavesdropping was possible and user accounts were compromised.",
         "attack_vector": "Eavesdropping on the connection during the handshake and compromising both user accounts.",
        "required_capabilities": "Ability to eavesdrop on the Tor network and compromise accounts. (Note: Tor's encryption made eavesdropping impossible)"
