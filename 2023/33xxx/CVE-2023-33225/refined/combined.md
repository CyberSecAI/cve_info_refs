| CVE-2023-33225 | SolarWinds Platform Deserialization of Untrusted Data Vulnerability | The SolarWinds Platform was found to be susceptible to the Incorrect Comparison Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows users with administrative access to SolarWinds Web Console to execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges. | 6.8 Medium | Piotr Bazydlo (@chudypb) of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |
| CVE-2023-33224 | SolarWinds Platform Incorrect Behavior Order Vulnerability | The SolarWinds Platform was found to be susceptible to the Incorrect Comparison Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows users with administrative access to SolarWinds Web Console to execute arbitrary commands with NETWORK SERVICE privileges. | 6.8 Medium | Piotr Bazydlo (@chudypb) of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |
| CVE-2023-23843 | SolarWinds Platform Incorrect Comparison Vulnerability | The SolarWinds Platform was found to be susceptible to the Incorrect Comparison Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows users with administrative access to SolarWinds Web Console to execute arbitrary commands. | 6.8 Medium | Piotr Bazydlo (@chudypb) of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |
| CVE-2023-33229 | SolarWinds Platform Incorrect Input Neutralization Vulnerability | The SolarWinds Platform was found to be susceptible to the Incorrect Input Neutralization Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows a remote adversary with a valid SolarWinds Platform account to append URL parameters to inject passive HTML. | 3.1 Low | Juampa Rodriguez (@UnD3sc0n0c1d0) |
| CVE-2023-3622 | SolarWinds Platform Access Control Bypass Vulnerability | An Access Control Bypass Vulnerability exists in the SolarWinds Platform that, if exploited, could allow an underprivileged user to read an arbitrary resource. | 4.6 Medium | Alex Shepard |

#### Third-party CVEs

| CVE-ID | Vulnerability Title | Description | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2022-37434 | Heap-Based Buffer Over-Read or Buffer Overflow Vulnerability | zlib through 1.2.12 has a heap-based buffer over-read or buffer overflow in inflate in inflate.c via a large gzip header extra field. NOTE: only applications that call inflateGetHeader are affected. Some common applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable to call inflateGetHeader (e.g., see the nodejs/node reference). | Critical |
| CVE-2012-6708 | Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability | jQuery before 1.9.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was HTML by looking for the '<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less common. | Medium |
| CVE-2020-11022 | DOM Manipulation Vulnerability | In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing it - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code. This problem is patched in jQuery 3.5.0 | Medium |
| CVE-2020-11023 | DOM Manipulation Vulnerability | In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.0.3 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML containing <option> elements from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing it - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code. This problem is patched in jQuery 3.5.0. | Medium |
| CVE-2015-9251 | Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability | jQuery before 3.0.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks when a cross-domain Ajax request is performed without the dataType option, causing text/javascript responses to be executed. | Medium |
| CVE-2019-11358 | Unsanitized Input Vulnerability | jQuery before 3.4.0, as used in Drupal, Backdrop CMS, and other products, mishandles jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...) because of Object.prototype pollution. If an unsanitized source object contained an enumerable \_\_proto\_\_ property, it could extend the native Object.prototype. | Medium |
| CVE-2020-7656 | Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability | jquery prior to 1.9.0 allows Cross-site Scripting attacks via the load method. The load method fails to recognize and remove "<script>" HTML tags that contain a whitespace character, i.e: "</script >", which results in the enclosed script logic to be executed. | High |

## Installation or upgrade

For new installations, you can download the installation file from the product page on [https://www.solarwinds.com](https://www.solarwinds.com/) or from the [Customer Portal](https://customerportal.solarwinds.com/login). For more information, see [Get the installer](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/orionplatform/content/install-new-deployment.htm).

For upgrades, including [options to pre-stage the installation files](../install-centralized-upgrade-primary-server.htm#Pre-stag), go to Settings > My Deployment to initiate the upgrade. The SolarWinds Installer upgrades your entire deployment (all SolarWinds Platform products and any scalability engines).

For more information, see the [SolarWinds Platform Product Installation and Upgrade Guide](https://www.solarwinds.com/documentation/kbloader.aspx?kb=MT88165).

You must be on SolarWinds Platform 2020.2.1 or later to upgrade to SolarWinds Platform 2023.3. If you are on SolarWinds Platform 2020.2 or earlier, first upgrade to 2020.2.6 and then upgrade to 2023.3.

[Return to top](#Top)

## Before you upgrade!

* Before upgrading from Orion Platform 2020.2.6 and earlier to SolarWinds Platform 2022.3 or later, make sure the database user you use to connect to your SQL Server has the **db create** privilege. **Without this privilege, the upgrade will not complete.**
* The legacy syslog and traps functionality has been retired and replaced with a new functionality called SolarWinds Log Viewer, which can be upgraded to Log Analyzer for additional capabilities. Current rules and history will automatically be migrated to the new logging functionality (SolarWinds Log Viewer or Log Analyzer). The functionality of SolarWinds Log Viewer and Log Analyzer has been improved to more closely match legacy functionality. See [LA 2022.3 release notes](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/la/content/release_notes/la_2022-3_release_notes.htm) for details.

  If you built syslog and trap alerts using custom SQL queries, they will not function after upgrading to 2022.3 or later. SolarWinds recommends you rewrite the alerts using SWQL (`Orion.OLM entities`) or using the alerting functionality built into Log Viewer/Log Analyzer.
* Some upgrade situations from the Orion Platform to the SolarWinds Platform are not supported and the installer will stop the upgrade automatically.
  + If you have a SQL Server older than 2016.
  + If you are on an Orion Platform product version earlier than 2020.2.1.

## Known issues

### Database login fails for Windows accounts after the upgrade

When you use Windows authentication to connect to the HCO database and the database SQL server, you can find Database: Login failed for user 'DOMAIN\MACHINENAME$' in the Website log. This can cause intermittent user logouts from the SolarWinds Web Console.

**Resolution or Workaround**: Change the database account. See [Database login failing for Windows account users after upgrading to 2023.1 and above](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Database-login-failing-for-Windows-account-users?language=en_US).

### Agent stops polling after a failover in an HA pool

In some cases, the agent configuration file `SolarWinds.Agent.Service.exe.cfg` can become corrupted after a failover in a SolarWinds High Availability (HA) pool. The corrupted configuration file is populated with host names or IP addresses of nodes that are not in the HA pool. If this happens, the agent stops polling and the agent status is reported as unknown.

**Resolution or Workaround**: Complete the following steps to correct or avoid this issue.

Important! Back up the `SolarWinds.AgentManagement.ServiceCore.dll.config` file before you make changes.

1. Open the `SolarWinds.AgentManagement.ServiceCore.dll.config` file in a text editor. By default, the location is:

   `C:\Program Files\SolarWinds\Orion\SolarWinds.AgentManagement.ServiceCore.dll.config`

   or

   `C:\Program Files (x86)\SolarWinds\Orion\SolarWinds.AgentManagement.ServiceCore.dll.config`
2. Add the following attribute to the `<agentManagementServiceConfiguration>` section:

   `sendToAgentJustIPAdressesWhichBelongsToTheSameHAPool="true"`

   For example:

   `<agentManagementServiceConfiguration messagingPort="17778" sendToAgentJustIPAdressesWhichBelongsToTheSameHAPool="true" />`
3. Save the file.
4. Restart the SolarWinds Services.
