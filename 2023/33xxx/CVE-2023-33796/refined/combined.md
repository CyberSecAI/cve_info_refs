| Version: 3.5.1Description Unauthentication GraphQL Database Query refers to a vulnerability where unauthorized individuals can execute queries against a GraphQL database without proper authentication. This means that anyone, without providing valid credentials, can access and manipulate sensitive data stored in the database. Proof of Concept**Step 1:** Go to `/graphql/`, insert payload GraphQL Database Query without authentication[image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/67278071/239313740-fa288bd6-3a83-4f26-8665-318894515798.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.EXLl6DfGqyjsxC0w4u9RClt20SykEaZRERy-ygrjFVc)Impact The impact of an unauthenticated GraphQL database query includes unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation or deletion, compromised data integrity, system unavailability, and damage to an organization's reputation. |

| [@jeremystretch](https://github.com/jeremystretch) Are you aware of the following being done:  <https://github.com/anhdq201/netbox/issues>  A CVE has been created for each of these, and is now being flagged in CVE parsing tools such as Flexera, and therefore flagging V3.5.1 as a risk.  An example CVE: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-33787>  Full List: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=Netbox>  Thanks  Andy |

| Issue [#1](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1)-15 is the same XSS, same field, just different models. No idea why anyone would submit 15 duplicate CVE's, but it pretty much underlines how useless CVE's really are. I assume he's farming CVE's.  The last one is invalid I think, however there's not really enough information to tell for sure. The screenshot is just an introspection query to get the schema, there's no data from the database, and no sensitive data as he claims.  The one xss should probably be fixed, but not sure if it's been reported at all. Feel free to create an issue. |

| I'll probably dispute the graphql one if I get the time as it seems invalid and misrepresented. I would hope that MITRE would catch spam like the first 15 CVE's, but we'll see. |

| Ive raised the issue, just bringing awareness really, as our instances have been flagged by our SEC teams, which requires replying to the inevitable tickets, etc. Im pretty sure most larger companies will start flagging this soon, as that is the default response with these things, regardless of knowledge. |

| FYI our policy for reporting suspected security vulnerabilities is documented [here](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/develop/SECURITY.md) per convention for open source projects. We have no control over information published by a third party and act only on reports submitted to us directly. |

| I've now disputed [CVE-2023-33796](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g22j-4jxh-2vc7 "CVE-2023-33796") and I've requested that `CVE-2023-33800,CVE-2023-33799,CVE-2023-33798,CVE-2023-33797,CVE-2023-33796,CVE-2023-33795,CVE-2023-33794,CVE-2023-33793,CVE-2023-33792,CVE-2023-33791,CVE-2023-33790,CVE-2023-33789,CVE-2023-33788,CVE-2023-33787,CVE-2023-33786,CVE-2023-33785` be merged into one CVE.  I hope MITRE will take action, as the reports are bordering on malicious.  I'll also reopen this discussion, just so it's easier to find for people looking for the same answer. Hope that's okay. |

| [CVE-2023-33796](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g22j-4jxh-2vc7 "CVE-2023-33796") has been marked as disputed: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33796>  Not sure what the next step for that is.  For the 15 duplicate CVE's, I haven't gotten any response since 29th of may, where the CVE Assignment Team posted a snippet from their rules indicating that they should be folded into one CVE. Think they misunderstood something or didn't read my text, but I've since provided proof (two line fix for all 15 issues) but have gotten no response. Not holding my breath to be honest.  The CVE database is next to useless, it shouldn't be taken serious but sadly it is. |

This was already mentioned in my initial report (can't share it, because it's a web form and I have gotten no copy of the initial message). |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
