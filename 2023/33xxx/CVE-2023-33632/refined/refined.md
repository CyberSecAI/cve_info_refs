{
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the `ipqos_lanip_dellist` function when handling user-supplied input from the `/goform/aspForm` interface.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Stack buffer overflow: The size of the local variable `v5` is only 16 bytes, but the code uses `getElement` function to split strings into this variable without proper bounds checking. The `getElement` function has a maximum size limit of 64 bytes, which, when exceeded, leads to a buffer overflow."
  ],
  "impact": "Exploitation can lead to a crash of the web server process. Furthermore, successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution and potentially a root shell on the device.",
   "attack_vectors": [
    "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint with the `CMD` parameter set to `ipqos_lanip_dellist` and a long string in the `param` parameter."
  ],
  "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the H3C Magic R300-2100M router. This typically means they must be on the same network as the router or have network access to it."
