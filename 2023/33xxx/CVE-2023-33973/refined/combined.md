# NULL pointer dereference during NHC encoding

High

[miri64](/miri64)
published
GHSA-r2pv-3jqc-vh7w
May 30, 2023

## Package

RIOT-OS

## Affected versions

<= 2023.01

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

RIOT-OS contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. An attacker can send a crafted frame which is forwarded by the device. During encoding of the packet a NULL pointer dereference occurs. This crashes the device leading to denial of service.

### Patches

None

### Workarounds

* None

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues)
* Email us at RIOT-security

### Bug Details

The function `_iphc_encode` checks if the next header exists ([source](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/iphc/gnrc_sixlowpan_iphc.c#L1644)):

```
    if (pkt->next->next == NULL) {
        DEBUG("6lo iphc: packet next header missing data");
        gnrc_pktbuf_release(dispatch);
        return NULL;
    }

```

If the next header is an encapsulated IPv6 header `_nhc_ipv6_encode_snip` will be called ([source](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/iphc/gnrc_sixlowpan_iphc.c#L1655)):

```
    case PROTNUM_IPV6: {    /* encapsulated IPv6 header */
        local_pos = _nhc_ipv6_encode_snip(pkt, netif_hdr, iface,
                                          &iphc_hdr[inline_pos], &nh);
        break;
    }

```

The function extracts the header ([source](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/iphc/gnrc_sixlowpan_iphc.c#L1495)):

```
    gnrc_pktsnip_t *hdr = pkt->next->next;

```

The header is then passed to `_iphc_ipv6_encode` ([source](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/iphc/gnrc_sixlowpan_iphc.c#L1511)):

```
    tmp = (ssize_t)_iphc_ipv6_encode(hdr, netif_hdr, iface, &nhc_data[nhc_len]);

```

This function tries to access the actual IPv6 header ([source](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/iphc/gnrc_sixlowpan_iphc.c#L1067)):

```
    ipv6_hdr_t *ipv6_hdr = pkt->next->data;

```

But it is not checked if the packet actually contains a next snippet and thus `next` might be `NULL` and the usage of `->data` will result in a `NULL` pointer dereference.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

- `cpu/stm32/periph_timer`: Generalize to also work with timers that do not have 4 channels
- `boards/common/stm32`: Add timer config for three timers based on TIM2, TIM15, and TIM16 (the three general-purpose timers of the STM32L4)
- `boards/nucleo-l432kc`: Make use of the new timer config

- Add a hint that `ztimer_xtimer_compat` can be used even after `xtimer` is gone

| It was a timeout during a long rust build, likely caused because cargo fetches are slow now. The exact same thing happened on a different worker before. I think it is caused by upstream repos being a bit slower now then they used to be. But I'd actually blame our lack of caching of remote resources in our CI. |
