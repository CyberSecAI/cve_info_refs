>= 3.0.0, <= 3.8.5

## Patched versions

4.4.6
3.8.6

## Description

### Summary

The platform does not filter input and encode output in Quick Post validation error message, which can deliver an XSS payload.

### Details

Old CVE fixed the XSS in label HTML but didn’t fix it when clicking save.

### PoC

1. Login at admin
2. Go to setting
3. Create a Section
4. On Entry page, click Edit label
5. Inject the XSS payload into the label and save
6. On the admin dashboard choose new widget -> Quick Post
7. In Quick Post, click save with blank slug; The XSS will be executed

   "errors":{"title":["<script>alert('nono')</script> cannot be blank."],"slug":["Slug cannot be blank."]

Fixed in [9d0cd0b](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/9d0cd0bda7c8a830a3373f8c0f06943e519ac888)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

([#13039](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/13039), [#12819](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12819))

* Fixed a bug where it wasn’t possible to preview entries on another domain when the system was offline. ([#12979](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12979))
* Fixed a bug where users were able to access volumes they didn’t have permission to view via Assets fields. ([#13006](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13006))
* Fixed a bug where zero-width spaces, invisible plus signs, and byte order marks weren’t getting stripped from sanitized asset filenames. ([#13022](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13022))
* Fixed a bug where the Plugin Store wasn’t accurately reporting installed plugins’ license statuses. ([#12986](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12986))
* Fixed a bug where the Plugin Store wasn’t handling 403 API responses for cart operations properly, once a cart had been handed off to Craft Console and assigned to an organization. ([#12916](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12916))
* Fixed a bug where `craft\helpers\FileHelper::absolutePath()` wasn’t treating Windows file paths beginning drive letters as absolute. ([craftcms/generator#16](https://github.com/craftcms/generator/issues/16))
* Fixed a bug where it wasn’t possible to sort Categories fields with “Maintain hierarchy” disabled. ([#10560](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/10560))
* Fixed a bug where selectize inputs didn’t have a minimum width. ([#12950](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12950))
* Fixed a bug where the wrong tab would appear to be initially selected after an autosave, if the selected tab had changed during the autosave. ([#12960](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12960))
* Fixed a bug where it wasn’t possible to add a Dropdown field without a blank option to a global set. ([#12965](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12965))
* Fixed a bug where automatically-added Matrix blocks (per the field’s Min Blocks setting) were getting discarded if no changes were made to them. ([#12973](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12973))
* Fixed an error that could occur when installing Craft with an existing project config, if any image transforms were defined that didn’t specify the `upscale` property.
* Fixed a bug where nested folders in asset search results weren’t showing their relative path.
* Fixed a bug where admin tables’ default delete icon title text wasn’t getting translated. ([#13030](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13030))
* Fixed a bug where it was possible to save a Local filesystem pointed at a system directory (e.g. the `templates/` or `vendor/` folders), which mitigates a potential RCE vulnerability.
* Fixed XSS vulnerabilities.
