{
  "CVE-2023-33865": {
    "Root cause": "Symlink vulnerability in the /tmp/RenderDoc directory creation and log file writing process.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The RenderDoc library creates or reuses /tmp/RenderDoc without verifying ownership.",
      "It opens log files within /tmp/RenderDoc in append mode.",
      "It prepends an uncontrolled header to log entries, but the header can be bypassed"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local unprivileged attacker can leverage the symlink vulnerability to write arbitrary data to arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running RenderDoc. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local attacker creates the /tmp/RenderDoc directory before the victim starts RenderDoc.",
      "The attacker populates the directory with symlinks pointing to arbitrary files.",
      "When the victim runs RenderDoc, it will write log data to these symlinked files."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access to the system and ability to create files and directories."
  }
}
