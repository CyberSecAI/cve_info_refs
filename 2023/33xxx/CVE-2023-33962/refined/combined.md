| The spec compliant escaping is probably unrealistic and not safe enough.  Backtick for example and equal are not escaped. The apostrophe missing is especially bad and an accident.   ---   EDIT if you are wondering how in the world someone could miss `'` for escaping HTML... you are in good company.  The TL;DR is originally the escaping code was [my own code for XML element content](https://github.com/agentgt/jatl/blob/master/src/main/java/com/googlecode/jatl/MarkupUtils.java) (yes that code is ancient but 10-15 years ago it was thought XHTML would win over HTML5 so XML escaping was preferred) as the plan was to somehow provide different escaping for attribute vs element as well as XML vs HTML.  The original Mustache spec only expected   * `"` * `&` * `<` * `>`   But this is obviously not exhaustive for HTML as apostrophe is required unlike XML. I knew this and had planned on offering two escapers for JStachio as well as a lambda for attribute escaping.  I also knew apostrophe representation as an entity can be done in several ways and I had mentally thought about providing an option for that (eg &[#39](https://github.com/jstachio/jstachio/pull/39); vs &#x27; vs the nasty &apos;).  Fast forward many months with some refactoring / API redesign I somehow ended up with just the XML element content escaping with no single quote aka apostrophe escaping.   * ``` * `'` * `=`   [@casid](https://github.com/casid) luckily saw the issue and reported and now we have a potential CVE (or at least requested). They didn't say what it was initially (as you should not in a bug) but I eventually deduced as that was one of the greatest features of JStachio is by nature of compiling it is generally very secure from lots of other attack points. So it was either file path stuff (e.g. `../../`) or escaping.  So yeah one of the bigger more embarrassing mistakes in my career/life as developer. I tried so hard to make sure 1.0.0 was solid did not have issues and here were are with basic XSS insecurity.  Going forward I will turn on as much checking as I can like adding Sonar, and CodeQL.  Thank you [@casid](https://github.com/casid) for finding this. |

### @agentgt **[agentgt](/agentgt)** commented [May 28, 2023](#issue-1729649760)

The original Mustache spec and various implementations only escaped

* `"`
* `&`
* `<`
* `>`

JStachio kept with that minimum HTML version agnostic escaping expecting users to use different escaping on attributes through a lambda.

Unfortunately that is unrealistic and dangerous and I should have added the additional following characters in:

* ```
* `'`
* `=`

I don't think the above problem deserves a CVE as it was documented that it only did the original 4 and while these additional characters prevent some level of script injection of attributes there are probably other exploits that can be done on HTML attributes (particularly the on attributes) with script tags.

Attribute escaping (and examination of scripts in those attributes) will at some point be provided as a feature through a lambda to prevent those kinds of exploits but for now it is best to only use trusted or sanitized content for HTML attributes.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# XSS vulnerability: Unescaped single quotes

Moderate

[agentgt](/agentgt)
published
GHSA-gwxv-jv83-6qjr
May 29, 2023

## Package

maven

io.jstach:jstachio
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

1.0.0

## Patched versions

1.0.1

## Description

### Impact

#### Description:

JStachio fails to escape single quotes `'` in HTML, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

#### Reproduction Steps:

Use the following template code:

```
<div attr='{{value}}'></div>
```

Set the value variable to `' onblur='alert(1)`.

```
public class Escaping {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Model model = new Model("' onblur='alert(1)");
        String result = AttributeTemplate.of().execute(model);
        System.out.println(result);
    }

    @JStache(template = "<div attr='{{value}}'></div>",
            name="AttributeTemplate")
    @JStacheConfig(contentType= Html.class)
    public static class Model {

        public final String value;

        public Model(String value) {
            this.value = value;
        }

        public String getValue() {
            return value;
        }
    }
}
```

Expected Result:

The resulting output should have properly escaped the single quotes and not execute the injected JavaScript code.

Actual Result:

The resulting output is vulnerable and renders as follows:

```
<div attr='' onblur='alert(1)'></div>
```
#### Impact and Risk:

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users visiting pages that use this template engine. This can lead to various consequences, including session hijacking, defacement of web pages, theft of sensitive information, or even the propagation of malware.

#### Proposed Solution:

To mitigate this vulnerability, the template engine should properly escape special characters, including single quotes. Common practice is to escape `'` as `&#39`.

### Patches

### Workarounds

As long as users stick with double quotes `"` for HTML attributes, they should not be affected.

### Severity

Moderate
