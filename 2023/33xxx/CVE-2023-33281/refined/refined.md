Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Nissan Sylphy Classic 2021 key fob uses fixed codes for locking and unlocking the vehicle, rather than rolling codes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Fixed Codes:** The key fob transmits the same code each time, making it vulnerable to replay attacks.
*   **Lack of Rolling Codes:** The absence of a rolling code mechanism means the transmitted codes do not change, which is a key weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can record the key fob's signal and replay it later to unlock and potentially start the vehicle.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is over the air, capturing the RF signal emitted by the key fob when the lock or unlock button is pressed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to be within range to intercept the RF signals from the key fob when it's in use.
*   The attacker requires an SDR (Software Defined Radio) or similar equipment to capture and replay the signals.

**Additional Notes:**
* The blog post references a similar vulnerability in Honda vehicles (CVE-2022-27254) which also involves fixed code key fobs.
* The post includes packet diagrams that show the lack of rolling codes being applied.
* A video demonstration is linked, showcasing the exploitation.
