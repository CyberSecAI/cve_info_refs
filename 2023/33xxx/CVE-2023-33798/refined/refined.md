  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'Name' field when creating a rack, leading to stored XSS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to full user compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An authenticated malicious user injects a malicious payload into the 'Name' field during rack creation."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker must be an authenticated user with the ability to create racks.",
      "The attacker must be able to navigate to the /dcim/rack/ page, create a rack, and then navigate to the /dcim/rack-reservations/ page to trigger the exploit"
    ],
    "description": "The vulnerability is located within the 'Create Rack' function of Netbox version 3.5.1, specifically in the 'Organization' feature. A malicious authenticated user can inject JavaScript code into the 'Name' field when creating a rack. This code is then stored and executed when a user views the rack, specifically when adding a rack reservation which causes the stored payload to be executed in the browser."
