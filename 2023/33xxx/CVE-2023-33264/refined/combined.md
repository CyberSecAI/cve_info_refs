Minor: This exposes additional information. For example now people can see if the user is using default value (null) or a set value even if the mask is enabled.

| Thanks for the reviews, guys. I'm aware of the point Ramiz has mentioned, and IMO such a risk is minimal. We usually have the password value mandatory. |

| [@kwart](https://github.com/kwart) [@ramizdundar](https://github.com/ramizdundar) [@promanenko](https://github.com/promanenko) does this vulnerability actually affect 3.x and 4.x releases as pointed out [here](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5gj6-62g7-vmgf) according to the affected versions? I was looking at the 3.x version and the [`ConfigXmlGenerator`](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/v3.12.13/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/config/ConfigXmlGenerator.java) class is quite different *(e.g.: there is no `system-user-password` bit, no `ldapAuthenticationGenerator` method either etc.)*. |
