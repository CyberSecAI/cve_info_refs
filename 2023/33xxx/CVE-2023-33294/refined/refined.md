- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `tctweb_server` binary, running as root, exposes a local web server that accepts HTTP POST requests with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data, which can include arbitrary bash commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - The server runs as root, granting high privileges to executed commands.
    - The server accepts arbitrary bash commands.
    - The server does not restrict access, responding to any request and returning `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` allowing any installed app or website loaded in the system browser to access it.
    - The server's use of HTTP on a local interface allows trivial cross-site request forgery attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Reading files, including sensitive user data (notifications, downloads).
    - Modifying files within unprotected partitions (e.g., `sdcard/`).
    - Bricking the device by modifying system properties (e.g., enabling the kill switch).
    - Execute arbitrary code as root.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending HTTP POST requests to `http://127.0.0.1:2929` with specific parameters to the `tctweb_server`.
    - The attack can be performed by any website or installed app.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have the user browse a malicious webpage or have an app installed on the device.
    - No user interaction beyond opening a page/app is needed.
