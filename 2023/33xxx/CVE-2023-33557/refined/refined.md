Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `order_by` method within the FUEL CMS framework. Specifically, the `id` parameter from a POST request is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. User-provided input is directly concatenated into an SQL query without adequate sanitization or parameterization.
- **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The `id` parameter, received via POST, is passed through multiple method calls without proper validation or escaping.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the user-supplied `id` parameter before using it in the `order_by` method. While Codeigniter's `where` method provides some protection by wrapping input in single quotes, this protection is bypassed when the input is later used in the `order_by` clause.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Database Compromise:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query, potentially allowing them to:
    - **Data Exfiltration:** Steal sensitive data from the database.
    - **Data Modification:** Modify or delete data within the database.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Gain access to the underlying database server or the system hosting it, depending on the database user's permissions.
- **Application Disruption:** The vulnerability could be used to disrupt the normal operation of the FUEL CMS application by manipulating database records or causing errors.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a POST request to the `fuel/modules/fuel/controllers/Blocks.php` endpoint.
- **`id` Parameter:** The vulnerable input is the `id` parameter passed within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable FUEL CMS application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `fuel/modules/fuel/controllers/Blocks.php` endpoint and the `id` parameter.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests with malicious SQL payloads in the `id` parameter.

**Technical Details:**

1.  The `import_view` method in `fuel/modules/fuel/controllers/Blocks.php` retrieves the `id` parameter from the POST request.
2.  This `id` parameter is used in a call to `find_by_key` method (or `find_by_name` according to the comments). Because this method does not exist, the magic `__call` method is invoked in the `MY_Model.php`.
3.  The `__call` method passes the input to the `where()` method, which properly escapes the input by wrapping it in single quotes.
4.  However, the `__call` method also passes the same input to an `order_by()` method. This method does not apply any escaping, directly concatenating the user input into the SQL query.
5.  Finally, the `get()` method executes the crafted SQL query, leading to SQL injection.

This detailed analysis provides a clear picture of how the SQL injection vulnerability in FUEL CMS works and the potential impact it can have.
