```
Added hotkey hint to Narrow to stream/topic/DM tooltips by creating
new tippy for `tippy-narrow-tooltip` with LONG_HOVER_DELAY which
appends `S` hotkey to the existing tippy content set by
data-tippy-content attribute on the element.

Using this approach instead of a <template> with
data-tooltip-template-id avoids issues with context, where
{display_recipient}/{topic}/{display_reply_to} inside <template>
would always show the same stream/topic name regardless of the
actual stream/topic being hovered over.

### @Ddharmani3 **[Ddharmani3](/Ddharmani3)** commented [May 1, 2023](#issue-1691292144) • edited Loading

CZO Discussion: <https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/137-feedback/topic/title.20tips.20in.20recipient.20bar>

Added hotkey hint to Narrow to stream/topic/DM tooltips by creating new tippy for `tippy-narrow-tooltip` with LONG\_HOVER\_DELAY which appends `S` hotkey to the existing tippy content set by data-tippy-content attribute on the element.

Using this approach instead of a `<template>` with

data-tooltip-template-id avoids issues with context, where `{display_recipient}/{topic}/{display_reply_to}` inside `<template>` would always show the same stream/topic name regardless of the actual stream/topic being hovered over.

| Feedback required:   1. is the approach used to append the hotkey at the end of the onCreate function right?(reason explained in PR description) 2. is the naming `tippy-narrow-tooltip` correct for the new tippy that is used for elements that are used to narrow-to a topic/stream/DM? |

[@timabbott](https://github.com/timabbott) and I discussed offline, and let's go with the following (followed by the keyboard shortcuts):  `Go to #stream name` `Go to #stream name > topic name` `Go to direct messages with name` |

Added hotkey hint to Narrow to stream/topic/DM tooltips by creating
new tippy for `tippy-narrow-tooltip` with LONG_HOVER_DELAY which
appends `S` hotkey to the existing tippy content set by
data-tippy-content attribute on the element.

Using this approach instead of a <template> with
data-tooltip-template-id avoids issues with context, where
{display_recipient}/{topic}/{display_reply_to} inside <template>
would always show the same stream/topic name regardless of the
actual stream/topic being hovered over.")`

[@Ddharmani3](https://github.com/Ddharmani3) This change introduced a serious security vulnerability [CVE-2023-33186](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-4r83-8f94-hrph), because `instance.props.content` is a user-controlled string with no guarantees of being safe to reinterpret as HTML.

Never parse a string as HTML unless it came from a known source of correctly generated HTML (such as an auto-escaping Handlebars template).

We’ve fixed this in commit [3ca1317](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/3ca131743b00f42bad8edbac4ef92656d954c629).

Commit [903dbda](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/903dbda79bd176702d3175a7c8a5450a64b6eccb) ([#25370](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25370)) introduced a
cross-site scripting vulnerability in the tooltips for the stream and
topic in the recipient bar.  An attacker who can send messages could
maliciously craft a topic for the message, such that a victim who
hovers the tooltip for that topic in their message feed triggers
execution of JavaScript code controlled by the attacker.

# Cross-site scripting vulnerability in Zulip Server development branch via topic tooltip

High

[andersk](/andersk)
published
GHSA-4r83-8f94-hrph
May 29, 2023

## Package

Zulip Server
(Application)

## Affected versions

7.0-beta1, 7.0-beta2, main branch (2023-05-02 and later)

## Patched versions

7.0-beta3

## Description

### Impact

The `main` development branch of Zulip Server from May 2, 2023 and later, including beta versions 7.0-beta1 and 7.0-beta2, is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in tooltips on the message feed. An attacker who can send messages could maliciously craft a topic for the message, such that a victim who hovers the tooltip for that topic in their message feed triggers execution of JavaScript code controlled by the attacker.

### Patches

The vulnerability was fixed in Zulip Server 7.0-beta3, and in the `main` branch with commit [3ca1317](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/3ca131743b00f42bad8edbac4ef92656d954c629).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
