Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability was introduced by commit `903dbda79bd176702d3175a7c8a5450a64b6eccb` as part of pull request #25370. This commit added a feature to include hotkey hints in "narrow-to" tooltips. The implementation used `instance.props.content` which is a user-controlled string, and directly concatenated it with the HTML of the hotkey template, then parsed the resulting string as HTML. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code into the tooltip via the topic of a message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. User-provided content (the topic of a message) was not properly sanitized before being used in the construction of a tooltip.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** By crafting a malicious topic, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session when the victim hovers over the tooltip for that topic in the message feed.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability Impact:**  The CVSS score indicates a high impact on confidentiality, low on integrity, and low on availability. This suggests an attacker could potentially steal user data, modify displayed content, or cause minor disruptions within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based.
- **Malicious Message:** An attacker crafts a message with a malicious topic.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must hover over the tooltip to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs the ability to send messages within the Zulip system, which is a low privilege.
- **Crafted Topic:** The attacker needs to craft the topic of a message to include malicious JavaScript code.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in the `main` development branch of Zulip Server from May 2, 2023, including beta versions 7.0-beta1 and 7.0-beta2.
- It was fixed in Zulip Server 7.0-beta3 and in the `main` branch with commit `3ca131743b00f42bad8edbac4ef92656d954c629`.
- The fix involved using a Handlebars template (`narrow_tooltip.hbs`) to properly render the content, avoiding direct parsing of user-controlled strings as HTML. The hotkey hint was also moved to this template.
- The vulnerable code was in `web/src/tippyjs.js`. Specifically, the `onCreate` function for tooltips with the class `tippy-narrow-tooltip`.
- The commit `3ca131743b00f42bad8edbac4ef92656d954c629` removed the `<template id="narrow-hotkey-tooltip-template">` from `web/templates/tooltip_templates.hbs` and moved the logic to the `web/templates/narrow_tooltip.hbs` file. The `tippyjs.js` file was modified to use the `render_narrow_tooltip` template to set the tooltip content and correctly parse the string as HTML.
