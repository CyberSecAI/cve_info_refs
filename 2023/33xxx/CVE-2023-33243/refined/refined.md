The provided content is related to CVE-2023-33243.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The STARFACE web interface and REST API allow authentication using the SHA512 hash of the password instead of the cleartext password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Broken Authentication: The system allows authentication with a password hash, which circumvents the security measure of storing password hashes instead of plaintext passwords.
- The web interface and REST API use the password hash instead of the cleartext password for authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers who gain access to the application's database or backups containing password hashes can use these hashes to authenticate and gain unauthorized access to the web interface and REST API, bypassing the need for cleartext passwords.
- Permanent unauthorized access can be achieved even if system access was obtained temporarily.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to the application's database.
- Access to backups of the database.
- Interception of the authentication request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the SHA512 hash of a user's password. This could be achieved through:
    - Compromise of the STARFACE PBX database.
    - Access to backups of the database stored elsewhere.
- Network access to send an authentication request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects STARFACE versions 7.3.0.10 and earlier.
- A temporary fix was implemented in version 8.0.0.11, where password hashes are encrypted in the database. However, this fix is not a complete solution as attackers with system level access can extract the encryption key.
- The provided advisory includes a Python script demonstrating the exploitation of the vulnerability.
