- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper boundary checks when performing validation operations during the retrofit package check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow. The retrofit validation command handler doesn't properly validate boundaries during certain operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote Code Execution on the targeted device.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based exploitation is possible if the attacker can send a malicious command to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any privileges. However, if the default Enforced Security mode or mTLS is enabled, the attacker will need high privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
