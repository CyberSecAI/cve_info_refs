# Blind SSRF When Uploading Presentation

Moderate

[antobinary](/antobinary)
published
GHSA-3q22-hph2-cff7
Jun 26, 2023

## Package

bbb-web
(BigBlueButton)

## Affected versions

<2.5.18, < 2.6.9

## Patched versions

2.5.18, 2.6.9

## Description

### Impact

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is an attack where a malicious actor can abuse an application's functionality to read or modify internal resources. This is typically accomplished by supplying a URL to the server, which the server will then interact with. In an `insertDocument` API request an admin that knows the API Secret Salt is able to supply a URL from which the presentation should be downloaded. This URL was being used without having been successfully validated first.

### Patches

An update to the `followRedirect` method in the `PresentationUrlDownloadService` has been made to validate all URLs to be used for presentation download. Two new properties `presentationDownloadSupportedProtocols` and `presentationDownloadBlockedHosts` have also been added to `bigbluebutton.properties` to allow administrators to define what protocols a URL must use and to explicitly define hosts that a presentation cannot be downloaded from. All URLs passed to `insertDocument` must conform to the requirements of the two previously mentioned properties. Additionally, these URLs must resolve to valid addresses, and these addresses must not be local or loopback addresses.

Patch on BigBlueButton 2.6.9: [#18045](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/18045)

Patch on BigBlueButton 2.5.18 [#18052](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/18052)

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds. We recommend upgrading to a patched version of BigBlueButton.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @paultrudel **[paultrudel](/paultrudel)** commented [May 30, 2023](#issue-1732800890)

### What does this PR do?

Adds a check to validate the presentation URL passed by presentation upload to ensure that it is not malicious and to protect against potential vulnerabilities from not validating the URL. Also adds two new properties to `bigbluebutton.properties` called `insertDocumentSupportedProtocols` and `insertDocumentBlockedHosts`. The `insertDocumentSupportedProtocols` property defines what protocols, such as HTTPS, are supported for presentation download URLs. The `insertDocumentBlockedHosts` property allows an administrator to explicitly define what hosts a presentation cannot be downloaded from.

The URL passed from presentation upload is considered valid if:

* It uses one of the supported protocols
* It does not originate from a host that has been blocked
* All addresses of the host are
  + Valid
  + Not local addresses
  + Not loopback addresses

### Motivation

The purpose of this URL validation is prevent potential vulnerabilities resulting from a URL that has not been validated being used in presentation download.

Sorry, something went wrong.
