- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the data input forms of SE Suite version 2.1.9. Malicious user can inject malicious script into a form field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize user inputs, allowing the injection of arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that get stored on the server, which are then served to other users. Consequences include stealing sensitive user information (login credentials), taking over user accounts, and altering page content/appearance to deceive users or impair functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious script into an input field on the affected application which is then stored on the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs access to the system and its data input forms.
