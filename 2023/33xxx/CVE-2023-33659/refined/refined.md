Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow caused by processing malformed MQTT SUBSCRIBE messages within the NanoMQ broker. The issue was found when the `nmq_subinfo_decode` function was called to decode the malformed message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** A buffer overflow occurs in the heap memory due to incorrect handling of malformed MQTT SUBSCRIBE messages. The `copyn_str` function in `mqtt_parser.c` was identified as the location of the overflow in the fix commit for issue 1155. Specifically, there was a missing length check before copying string data that led to out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a crash of the NanoMQ broker, resulting in a denial-of-service. If AddressSanitizer (ASAN) is enabled during compilation, the crash will display ASAN information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Sending malformed MQTT SUBSCRIBE messages to the NanoMQ broker via a network connection (e.g., using `nc`). The vulnerability is triggered during message parsing and processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send messages to the NanoMQ broker.
*   **Crafted message:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious MQTT SUBSCRIBE message to trigger the buffer overflow.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was reported by the School of Cyber Science and Technology, Shandong University.
*   The vulnerability was initially identified and addressed in issue #1154 and fixed in pull request #509 in the NanoNNG repository. However, it was later discovered that the initial fix was incomplete and the vulnerability could be triggered in a different location, which was reported as issue #1167.
*   The code fix for issue 1155 added a check `limit < 2` in function `copyn_str` to prevent a length check error before copying string.
*   The vulnerability was tested on Ubuntu 20.04, using gcc 9.4.0 and clang 10.0.0.
