- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to the application not using parameterized queries, which allows for the injection of SQL commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/module/scheduler/index.php` component. Specifically, the "activity" GET parameter is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted GET request with a malicious payload in the `activity` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with access to the scheduler (PR:L).
