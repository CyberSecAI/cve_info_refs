{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by making a registry serve an infinite number of signatures for an artifact, which the notation tool would then attempt to process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The notation tool did not limit the number of signatures it would process for a given artifact, allowing for a potential denial-of-service.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service on the host machine running `notation verify` due to excessive resource consumption while processing a large number of signatures.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker controlling or compromising a container registry can serve an arbitrarily large number of signatures for an artifact.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or compromise a container registry."
