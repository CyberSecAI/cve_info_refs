```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `EditvsList` function allocates a local variable of only 20 bytes, but the parameters passed to it are split using the `getElement` function, which can create strings up to 64 bytes long, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The stack overflow can lead to a crash of the `webs` process, and potentially allow for arbitrary code execution to gain a root shell.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint with the `CMD=EditvsList` and a long `param` value.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have network access to the device and be able to send HTTP requests to it. They also must know the device's IP address."
