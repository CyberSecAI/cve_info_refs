- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could perform actions intended for users with higher privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the affected function.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a function that lacks proper access control checks. The specific attack vector depends on the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker only needs subscriber privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
