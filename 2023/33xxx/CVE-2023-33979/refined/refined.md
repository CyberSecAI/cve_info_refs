The provided content relates to CVE-2023-33979.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from insufficient access control on the `/file` route, allowing arbitrary file access within the application's working directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The application does not properly restrict access to the `/file` route, allowing an attacker to read sensitive configuration files, such as `config.py`, `config_private.py`, `Dockerfile` and other files, potentially leading to information disclosure.
- Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Security Feature (CWE-266)
- Improper Access Control (CWE-284)
- Information Exposure (CWE-200)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive configuration files, potentially exposing passwords, API keys, and other sensitive information. This information could be used for further malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited via network access. The `/file` route can be accessed via HTTP, and providing the file path as an argument.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires network access to the application and low privileges to exploit the vulnerability. No user interaction is required for the attack.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.37 by adding `blocked_paths` parameter to `demo.launch` function in `main.py`, which prevent access to specified config files.
- The commit `1dcc2873d2168ad2d3d70afcb453ac1695fbdf02` addresses the vulnerability.
- Workarounds include using environment variables or docker-compose for configuration.
