# gpt\_academic Configuration File File Information Disclosure

Moderate

[binary-husky](/binary-husky)
published
GHSA-pg65-p24m-wf5g
May 31, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=3.36

## Patched versions

3.37

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability was found in gpt\_academic <=3.36. This issue affects some unknown processing of the component Configuration File Handler. The manipulation of the argument file leads to information disclosure.

Influence users that uses file configerations via `config.py`, `config_private.py`, `Dockerfile`

### Patches

[1dcc287](https://github.com/binary-husky/gpt_academic/commit/1dcc2873d2168ad2d3d70afcb453ac1695fbdf02)

**Patched after version 3.37**

### Workarounds

[1dcc287](https://github.com/binary-husky/gpt_academic/commit/1dcc2873d2168ad2d3d70afcb453ac1695fbdf02)

or **Using environment variables instead of `config*.py` files to configure this project, or use docker-compose installation to configure this project**

### References

<https://github.com/binary-husky/gpt_academic>

### For more information

Since no sensitive files are configured to be off-limits, sensitive information files in some working directories can be read through the `/file` route, leading to sensitive information leakage

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
