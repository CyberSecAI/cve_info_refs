The provided content details a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Faculty Evaluation System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an arbitrary file upload flaw in the `/eval/ajax.php?action=update_user` endpoint. The system does not properly validate or sanitize uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload malicious PHP files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The application allows users to upload files without proper validation of file type, content, or extension.
- Lack of sanitization: The application does not sanitize uploaded filenames or contents, thus allowing the upload of executable files (e.g. php).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution (RCE): By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `/eval/ajax.php?action=update_user`.
- `multipart/form-data`: The attacker uses a multipart form data to submit user information, along with a malicious PHP file in the 'img' field.
- Direct file access via web browser: After upload, the attacker directly accesses the uploaded php file in the browser to trigger execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable system
- Ability to craft HTTP requests.
-  Valid super admin account (admin@admin.com/admin123) is used in the reported exploit to access the vulnerable endpoint.
