Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Memory leaks occur in `mp4file_io.cpp` at lines 409 and 354. Specifically, memory allocated for strings using `MP4Malloc` and `MP4Realloc` within `ReadCountedString` and `ReadString` functions, respectively, is not deallocated. This is due to uncaught exceptions thrown by `ReadBytes()`, leading to memory leaks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory Leak:** Unreleased memory is allocated in `MP4File::ReadCountedString` and `MP4File::ReadString`, resulting in a memory leak.
- **Exception Handling:** The code doesn't properly handle exceptions in methods calling `MP4File::ReadBytes()`, causing memory allocated before the exception is not freed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeatedly triggering the vulnerable code paths can lead to memory exhaustion, potentially causing the application to crash or become unstable.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious MP4 Files:**  Crafted MP4 files with specific structures that trigger the vulnerable code paths in `MP4File::ReadCountedString` and `MP4File::ReadString`. By providing malicious input to `mp4info`, the program will parse it using vulnerable code, leading to memory leaks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and provide crafted MP4 files
- Ability to run `mp4info` tool on a system using the vulnerable library

**Additional details:**

The issue was reported by user AceSrc, who used AddressSanitizer to detect memory leaks while using `mp4info` tool with specially crafted MP4 files. The issue was fixed by commit `c724815` which implemented correct exception handling to ensure allocated memory is freed even if exceptions are thrown. The vulnerability lies in how the `mp4v2` library handles reading string data from MP4 files.
