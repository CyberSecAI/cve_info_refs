Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Planet Technologies WDRT-1800AX router uses a simple boolean cookie (`LoginStatus`) to determine user authentication. The web management interface checks for the presence of this cookie and if its value is set to `true`, it grants access to all administrative functions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Authentication bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper authentication checks. By simply setting the `LoginStatus` cookie to `true`, an attacker can bypass the login form and gain full access to the router's web management interface.
*   **Default telnet configuration:** The router has a default configuration where the root user does not have a password, allowing anyone to log in via telnet without providing credentials after exploiting the authentication bypass.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Full administrative access:** An attacker can access all administrative functions of the router, including password resets, configuration downloads, and enabling telnet.
*   **Remote root shell:** Combining the authentication bypass with the default telnet configuration allows an attacker to gain a root shell on the device.
*   **Complete device compromise:** A compromised router can be used in further attacks on the local network or used for botnet activity, data exfiltration, etc.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **LAN-adjacent attack:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the router to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **HTTP request manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the HTTP request by setting the `LoginStatus` cookie to `true`.
*   **Telnet connection:** After gaining access, the attacker connects to the telnet service to obtain a root shell.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable router.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface and manipulate cookies.
*   **Basic networking knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with network concepts, such as HTTP, cookies, and telnet.
*  **Ability to use a scripting language** The python script provided shows the steps needed to exploit the vulnerability, enabling telnet and interacting with the shell.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates a Python script that sets the cookie, enables telnet, and then connects to the telnet service as root to gain a shell.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor, who released a firmware update to address the issue.
