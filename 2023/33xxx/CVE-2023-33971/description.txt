Formcreator is a GLPI plugin which allow creation of custom forms and the creation of one or more tickets when the form is filled. A probable stored cross-site scripting vulnerability is present in Formcreator 2.13.5 and prior via the use of the use of `##FULLFORM##` for rendering. This could result in arbitrary javascript code execution in an admin/tech context. A patch is unavailable as of time of publication. As a workaround, one may use a regular expression to remove `< > "` in all fields.
