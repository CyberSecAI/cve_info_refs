Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is an insufficient check on the `xredirect` parameter in XWiki URLs. This parameter is used to redirect users after certain actions, such as login. The vulnerability arises because the application doesn't properly validate the provided URL in the `xredirect` parameter, allowing attackers to redirect users to arbitrary, untrusted sites. Specifically, the vulnerability was found to be exploitable even after previous fixes by using URLs like `http:example.com`, which bypass some checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The core vulnerability is an open redirect, where the application redirects users to a URL specified in a parameter without proper validation.
*   **Insufficient URL Validation:** The application's URL validation logic was not robust enough to catch various forms of malicious URLs, such as those using double slashes or missing a single slash.
*   **Bypass of Previous Fixes:** Previous attempts to fix similar open redirect issues were circumvented by crafted URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites that mimic legitimate login pages or other sensitive content. This can lead to users unknowingly entering their credentials on a fake website.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers could leverage the open redirect to make malicious links appear as if they belong to the legitimate XWiki site, increasing the likelihood that users will click on them.
*   **Reputation Damage:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could damage the reputation of the XWiki platform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL with the `xredirect` parameter set to an attacker-controlled domain.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers would need to trick users into clicking the manipulated link. This could be achieved through various social engineering methods, like sending the link in emails.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to send a crafted URL to a vulnerable XWiki instance.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs some social engineering skills to trick users into clicking the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was partially fixed previously, but a bypass was found.
*   The fix involves validating the redirect URLs using a new URI parsing method.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site).
*   The vulnerability affects XWiki versions prior to 14.10.4 and 15.0.
