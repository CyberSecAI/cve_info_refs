The provided content is related to CVE-2023-32983.

**CVE-2023-32983** is associated with a vulnerability in the Ansible Plugin for Jenkins.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Ansible Plugin stores extra variables, commonly used for secrets, unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
- These variables are also not masked in the job configuration form.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unencrypted storage of secrets**: Extra variables are stored in plain text.
- **Lack of masking**: Extra variables are displayed unmasked in the job configuration form.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the unencrypted secrets stored in the configuration files.
- Attackers can observe and capture the secrets from the job configuration form due to the lack of masking.

**Attack vectors:**
- Accessing the Jenkins controller file system directly.
- Having Item/Extended Read permission, which allows viewing job configurations.
- Observing the job configuration form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have at least Item/Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller filesystem, to exploit the vulnerability.
- Physical access to the controller or ability to perform actions on the Jenkins controller.
