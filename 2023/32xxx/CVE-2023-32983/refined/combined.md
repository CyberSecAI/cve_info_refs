**Description:**

HashiCorp Vault Plugin 360.v0a\_1c04cf807d and earlier does not properly mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) credentials printed in the build log from Pipeline steps like `sh` and `bat`, when both of the following conditions are met:

* The credentials are printed in build steps executing on an agent (typically inside a `node` block).
* Push mode for durable task logging is enabled.
  This is a hidden option in [Pipeline: Nodes and Processes](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-durable-task-step/) that can be enabled through the [Java system property](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/) `org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.steps.durable_task.DurableTaskStep.USE_WATCHING`.
  It is also automatically enabled by some plugins, e.g., [OpenTelemetry](https://plugins.jenkins.io/opentelemetry/) and [Pipeline Logging over CloudWatch](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-cloudwatch-logs/).

|  | An improvement in [Credentials Binding](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding/) 523.525.vb\_72269281873 implements a workaround that applies build log masking even in affected plugins. This workaround is temporary and potentially incomplete, so it is still recommended that affected plugins be updated to resolve this issue. |
