**CVE-2023-32986**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The File Parameter Plugin does not restrict the name (and resulting uploaded file name) of Stashed File Parameters.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Arbitrary file write vulnerability on the Jenkins controller file system.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with Item/Configure permission can create or replace arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system with attacker-specified content.
*   **Attack vectors**: By exploiting the lack of restriction on the name of Stashed File Parameters, an attacker can upload a file with a malicious name that leads to arbitrary file write on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs Item/Configure permission in Jenkins to exploit this vulnerability.
