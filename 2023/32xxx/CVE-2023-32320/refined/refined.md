The content is related to CVE-2023-32320.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The brute-force protection mechanism in Nextcloud did not properly limit the number of parallel requests. When multiple requests were sent simultaneously, all of them were executed even if the number of faulty requests exceeded the configured limit by the time the response was sent.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper limitation of parallel requests in brute-force protection
- Race condition leading to bypassing the configured limit for faulty requests

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could send more requests than intended, bypassing the brute-force protection mechanism.
- This could allow the attacker to bruteforce protected details like usernames, passwords, or other sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack
- Sending multiple parallel requests to the server

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No special privileges or user interaction required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server.
