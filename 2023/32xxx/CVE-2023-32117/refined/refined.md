- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, leading to a broken access control issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unprivileged users can perform actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users. The specific impact varies on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable function. No special privileges or prior access is required.
