  - Execute malicious code on the system, potentially gaining full control (arbitrary code execution).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted SIM2 file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to make the vulnerable software open a malicious SIM2 file. User interaction is required (UI:R). The attacker needs to have local access (AV:L) but does not need any privileges (PR:N).

**Affected Products:**
- TELLUS v4.0.15.0 and earlier
- TELLUS Lite v4.0.15.0 and earlier
