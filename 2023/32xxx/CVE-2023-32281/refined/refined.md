Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2023-32281:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the affected application's lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files (e.g., CSP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125) in the FontManager.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker could leverage the vulnerability by providing a maliciously crafted project file (CSP) that triggers an out-of-bounds read during parsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the maliciously crafted CSP file to the affected application.
- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system running the vulnerable software.
- User interaction is required to open the malicious file.
