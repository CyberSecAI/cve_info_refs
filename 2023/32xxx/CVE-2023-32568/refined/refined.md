Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Veritas InfoScale Operations Manager (VIOM) web application fails to validate user-supplied data and appends it to OS commands and internal binaries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **OS Command Injection:** The application is vulnerable to OS Command Injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands. (CWE-78)

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with root/administrator level privileges can:
*   Read sensitive data stored on the servers.
*   Modify data or server configuration.
*   Delete data or application configuration.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the VIOM web application interface. An attacker can supply malicious input through the web interface to be processed by vulnerable commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs root or administrator-level privileges to exploit the vulnerability successfully.
*   The attacker needs network access to the VIOM web application.
