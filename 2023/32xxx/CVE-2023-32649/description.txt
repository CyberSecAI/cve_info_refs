A Denial of Service (Dos) vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC, due to improper input validation in certain fields used in the Asset Intelligence functionality of our IDS, allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash the IDS module by sending specially crafted malformed network packets.

During the (limited) time window before the IDS module is automatically restarted, network traffic may not be analyzed.
