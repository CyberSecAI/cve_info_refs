- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking in the Cellular component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient bounds checks leading to a potential out-of-bounds write or read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable. It is related to cellular network functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be remote and have some mechanism to trigger the vulnerability within the Cellular component.
