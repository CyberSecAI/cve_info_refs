# User session not correctly destroyed on logout

High

GHSA-q8c4-chpj-6v38
May 24, 2023

## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

>= 25.0.2, >= 26.0.0

## Patched versions

25.0.6, 26.0.1

Server
(Nextcloud Enterprise)

>= 25.0.2, >= 26.0.0

25.0.6, 26.0.1

## Description

### Impact

A regression in the session handling between Nextcloud Server and the Nextcloud Text app prevented a correct destruction of the session on logout if cookies were not cleared manually. After successfully authenticating with any other account the previous session would be continued and the attacker would be authenticated as the previously logged in user.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 25.0.6 or 26.0.1

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 25.0.6 or 26.0.1

### Workarounds

* Disable the Nextcloud Text app

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
