Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-32318:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A regression in the session handling between Nextcloud Server and the Nextcloud Text app caused the session to not be correctly destroyed on logout if cookies were not manually cleared.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper session termination: The session of a logged-out user was not invalidated, leading to a persistent session.
- Inadequate handling of cookies: The system failed to clear session-related cookies upon logout.
- Session reuse: The old session could be reused by subsequent logins, leading to privilege escalation.
- CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could gain access to the account of a previous user by logging in with any other account if the previous user's cookies were not manually cleared. This allows the attacker to impersonate the previous user, potentially gaining access to sensitive data and functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would need to be on the same device or have access to the session cookies that were not cleared.
- The vulnerability is triggered after a user logs out of a Nextcloud instance without manually clearing cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs low privileges.
- The attacker needs to have access to a device where a previous user has logged out without clearing cookies and then log in to the same Nextcloud instance using another account.
- User interaction is required in that the user has to log out without clearing their cookies, and the attacker has to log in afterwards.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Nextcloud Server versions >= 25.0.2 and >= 26.0.0 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions >= 25.0.2 and >= 26.0.0.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 25.0.6 and 26.0.1.
- The issue was addressed by ensuring that user session data is not persisted improperly in the session.
- A temporary workaround was to disable the Nextcloud Text app.
