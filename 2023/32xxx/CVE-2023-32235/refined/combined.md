### Commits on Apr 7, 2023

1. [Added fetchAndDownloadFile method to utils service](/TryGhost/Ghost/commit/3dac3cb4e2cbbfc9473d2ca73349d516a63d883a)
    …

   ```
   The existing approach didn't expose when the download was complete.

   By fetching the file upfront and downloading from a blob we can better
   estimate when the download is complete because we load the file in
   memory, and then download from there.

   The promise resolves after the file is in memory, so the delay between
   the promise resolving and the file actually being downloaded is a lot
   shorter, and based on the size of the file.
   ```

   refs [TryGhost/Product#2935](https://github.com/TryGhost/Product/issues/2935)

   This allows us to track the state with a loading spinner and a
   success/error message on completion. This is expecially important for
   larger sites where the download can take a long time, and users are
   unsure if something is happening.

   ```
   refs [TryGhost/Product#2936](https://github.com/TryGhost/Product/issues/2936)

   We want to make sure that downloads complete in a reasonable number of
   time, and the simplest way to do that is to cap the size of the file.
