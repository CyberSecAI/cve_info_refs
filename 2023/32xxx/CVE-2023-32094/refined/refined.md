Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a result of missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function within the WordPress Extended Post Status plugin. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is a broken access control issue, specifically the absence of necessary checks to verify if a user has the required permissions to perform certain actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is described as having low severity and unlikely to be exploited. The specific impact will vary depending on the exact function that is vulnerable and what actions a lower-privileged user could perform as a result. However, in general, this type of vulnerability could lead to unauthorized data modification or access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a vulnerable function within the plugin that lacks proper access control checks, allowing an unprivileged user to interact with it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with "contributor" level privileges or lower on the WordPress site. They exploit the vulnerability from within the WordPress environment.
