## Veritas InfoScale Operations Manager (VIOM) Security Advisory

### Revision History

* 1.0: May 02, 2023: Initial version
* 1.1: May 19, 2023: Added CVE IDs
* 1.2: June 17, 2023: Updated description for Issue #2 SQL Injection

### Summary

Veritas has discovered security vulnerabilities with Veritas InfoScale Operations Manager (VIOM) as described below.

| Issue | Description | Severity | Fixed Versions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Arbitrary Command Execution | High | 7.4.2.800 8.0.410 |
| 2 | SQL Injection | High | 7.4.2.800 8.0.410 |

### Issue #1: Arbitrary Command Execution

The VIOM web application does not validate the user supplied data and appends it to OS-commands and internal binaries used by the application. An attacker with root/administrator level privileges can use this vulnerability to read sensitive data stored on the servers, modify data or server configuration and delete data or application configuration.

* CVE ID: [CVE-2023-32568](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32568)
* Severity: High
* CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.2 [( AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H )](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
* CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')

### Issue #2: SQL Injection

The InfoScale VIOM web application is vulnerable to SQL Injection in some of the areas of the application. This allows attackers to submit arbitrary SQL commands on the back-end database to create, read, update, delete any sensitive data stored in the database. Exploiting the vulnerability requires access to the application with valid admin credentials.

* CVE ID: [CVE-2023-32569](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32569)
* Severity: High
* CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.2: [( AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H )](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
* CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
