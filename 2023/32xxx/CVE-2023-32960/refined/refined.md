- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The UpdraftPlus WordPress plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to execute unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the WordPress application.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious request and tricking a logged-in user into submitting it, attackers can leverage the CSRF vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted request, typically through social engineering or malicious links. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
