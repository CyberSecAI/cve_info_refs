# Possible damage of secure element in Bosch IP cameras

BOSCH-SA-435698-BT

## Advisory Information

* **Advisory ID:**  BOSCH-SA-435698-BT
* **CVE Numbers and CVSS v3.1 Scores:**
  + [CVE-2023-32229](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32229)
    - Base Score:  [4.9 (Medium)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
* **Published:**  31 May 2023
* **Last Updated:**  31 May 2023

## Summary

Due to an error in the software interface to the secure element chip on the cameras, the chip can be  **permanently damaged**  leading to an unusable camera when enabling the Stream security option (signing of the video stream) on Bosch CPP13 and CPP14 cameras. The default setting for this option is "off".

## Affected Products

* Bosch Camera Firmware on: CPP13
  + CVE-2023-32229
    - Version(s): < 8.48
* Bosch Camera Firmware on: CPP14
  + CVE-2023-32229
    - Version(s): 8.50 - 8.72 (including)

## Solution and Mitigations

### Software Updates

The recommended approach is to update the affected Bosch firmware to a fixed version. If an update is not possible in a timely manner, users are recommended to follow the mitigations and workarounds described in the following section. The versions to fix this issue are listed in the Advisory Appendix.

A reboot of the camera is required after uploading the update.

The version of the firmware should be checked after the update to confirm successful installation e.g. in the web based interface (Services - System Overview)

### Increase Signature Interval

The default value for the signature interval is 1 second. Increasing the signature interval to 30 seconds will mitigate the problem without decreasing security of the signing process. During verification process of the video it might take longer for the signature to be verified. After installing the fixed version the interval can be set to 1 second again.

### Disable Signature

Disabling this feature will, of course, mitigate this issue, but the video stream will no longer be signed and cannot be verified afterwards. After installing the update the feature can be enabled again.

## Vulnerability Details

### CVE-2023-32229
