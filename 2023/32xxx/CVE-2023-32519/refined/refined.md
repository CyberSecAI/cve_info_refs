Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a "Broken Access Control" issue in the WCP Contact Form plugin for WordPress. Specifically, there is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly verify if a user has the necessary permissions to perform certain actions. This allows an attacker with low privileges to perform actions that should be restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute higher-privileged actions within the WordPress site. The specific impact could vary depending on the actions the unprivileged user could perform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the vulnerable plugin's functionality, where missing access controls allow unauthorized users to trigger privileged operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker only needs to be a "Contributor" user, which is a low-level user role in WordPress. This suggests the vulnerability is easily exploitable by an attacker with basic access to the WordPress site.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as having a "Low" severity and a CVSS score of 4.3.
*   There is currently no official fix available for the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable plugin versions are those less than or equal to 3.1.0.
