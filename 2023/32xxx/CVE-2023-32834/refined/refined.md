Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-32834:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an "incorrect comparison" within the `secmem` component. This type confusion can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-697 Incorrect Comparison:** The core weakness lies in using an incorrect comparison during a security-sensitive operation, leading to a type confusion.
- **Memory Corruption:** This incorrect comparison can cause memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation could lead to a local elevation of privilege.
- **System Execution Privileges:** The attacker would need System execution privileges to fully exploit the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is local, meaning an attacker would need to have some level of access to the device.
- User interaction is **not** needed for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the device.
- System execution privileges.

**Affected Chipsets:**
The vulnerability affects a wide range of MediaTek chipsets, including:
MT6580, MT6735, MT6737, MT6739, MT6753, MT6761, MT6765, MT6768, MT6771, MT6779, MT6781, MT6785, MT6789, MT6833, MT6835, MT6853, MT6853T, MT6855, MT6873, MT6877, MT6879, MT6883, MT6885, MT6886, MT6889, MT6893, MT6895, MT6983, MT6985, MT8185, MT8321, MT8385, MT8666, MT8667, MT8673, MT8675, MT8765, MT8766, MT8768, MT8781, MT8786, MT8788, MT8789, MT8791, MT8791T, MT8797, MT8798

**Affected Software Versions:**
- Android 11.0, 12.0, and 13.0
