- **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the display drm component due to a missing bounds check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a missing bounds check within the display drm component that allows for writing outside of allocated memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to local privilege escalation, granting an attacker elevated access within the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have some level of access to the device to trigger this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires system execution privileges and the ability to interact with the vulnerable display drm component. User interaction is not required for exploitation.
