Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3594-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                    Thorsten Alteholz
September 30, 2023                            <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : cups
Version        : 2.2.10-6+deb10u9
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-4504 CVE-2023-32360
Debian Bug     : #1051953

Two issues have been found in cups, the Common UNIX Printing System(tm).

CVE-2023-4504

  Due to missing boundary checks a heap-based buffer overflow and code
  execution might be possible by using crafted postscript documents.

CVE-2023-32360

  Unauthorized users might be allowed to fetch recently printed documents.

  Since this is a configuration fix, it might be that it does not reach
  you if you are updating the package.
  Please double check your /etc/cups/cupds.conf file, whether it limits
  the access to CUPS-Get-Document with something like the following
  >  <Limit CUPS-Get-Document>
  >    AuthType Default
  >    Require user @OWNER @SYSTEM
  >    Order deny,allow
  >   </Limit>
  (The important line is the 'AuthType Default' in this section)

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.10-6+deb10u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.

For the detailed security status of cups please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cups>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
