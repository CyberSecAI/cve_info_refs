### **[steven-bellock](/steven-bellock)** commented [May 29, 2023](#issue-1731068294)

| Following a successful CAPABILITIES response a libspdm Requester stores the Responder's CTExponent into its context without validation. If the Requester sends a request message that requires a cryptography operation by the Responder, such as CHALLENGE, libspdm will calculate the timeout value using the Responder's unvalidated CTExponent.  ``` ((uint64_t)2 << context->connection_info.capability.ct_exponent)  ```  If the value of CTExponent is greater than or equal to 64 then C language undefined behavior is invoked. Note that libspdm provides a method to query the value of the CTExponent after VCA.  This also happens with RDTExponent. Note also that shifting the value `2` is incorrect. It should be `1`. |

| It seems like a reasonable maximum value. If a Responder takes 35 minutes to process a response does any Requester really want to talk to it? |

| Entirely fair. This does seem like a diversion from the spec as a result of a gap in the spec. In addition to this upper-bound here, could we move to have this upper bound defined in the spec for future versions of SPDM? |

| [@steven-bellock](https://github.com/steven-bellock) thank you for doing that, it's minor but it makes the spec better. Would you be OK adding that link in a comment near those defines, to provide guidance in case someone else comes across this? |

# DMTF-2023-0002: Responder can Invoke Undefined Behavior in libspdm Requester

Moderate

[jyao1](/jyao1)
published
GHSA-56h8-4gv5-jf2c
Jun 1, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

2.3.2

## Patched versions

2.3.3 and 3.0

## Description

### Impact

Following a successful CAPABILITIES response a libspdm Requester stores the Responder's CTExponent

into its context without validation. If the Requester sends a request message that requires

a cryptography operation by the Responder, such as CHALLENGE, libspdm will calculate the timeout value

using the Responder's unvalidated CTExponent.

```
((uint64_t)2 << context->connection_info.capability.ct_exponent)

```

If the value of CTExponent is greater than or equal to 64 then C language undefined behavior is invoked.

Note that libspdm provides a method to query the value of the CTExponent after VCA.

For X86 (ia32, x64) CPU, MSVC or GCC compiler generates SHL or SHLD instruction. SHL will cause

discarding, if bits shifted beyond the destination boundary. SHLD will will use 5 bits (32) or

6 bits (64) for the shifting. No security impact.

For ARM (arm, aarch64) CPU, GCC compiler generates LSL instruction, which will use 5 bits (32) or

6 bits (64) for the shifting. No security impact.

For RISC-V (32 or 64) CPU, GCC compiler generates SLL instruction, which will use 5 bits (32) or

6 bits (64) for the shifting. No security impact.

For other CPUs, the impact is unknown.

### Patches

libspdm main:

libspdm 2.3:

Because libspdm 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 have known defects, they are not maintained.

libspdm 2.3 branch users should upgrade to release 2.3.3.

### Workarounds

After completion of VCA the Requester can check the value of the Responder's CTExponent. If it greater than

or equal to 64 then the Requester can stop communication with the Responder. Note that the Requester would probably

want to do that anyways, since if CTExponent is greater than equal to 64 then the Responder is asserting that it may take many eons to complete a cryptography operation.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
