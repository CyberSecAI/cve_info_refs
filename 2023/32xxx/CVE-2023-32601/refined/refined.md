**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a **broken access control** issue within the WordPress Booking Ultra Pro plugin. Specifically, there's a lack of proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to potentially execute actions that require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the failure to properly restrict access to certain functionalities, allowing unauthorized users to perform privileged actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by interacting with a vulnerable function lacking the necessary access controls. The exact attack vector would depend on the specific function affected within the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have at least a subscriber-level user account on the WordPress site. No special network access is needed, as it's a web-based vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects versions of the Booking Ultra Pro plugin up to and including 1.1.12.
*   The issue is fixed in version 1.1.13.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 5.4, classified as low severity.
