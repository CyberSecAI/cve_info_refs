The provided content is related to CVE-2023-32751.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from hardcoded secrets used to sign presigned URLs, which are exposed in the JavaScript files of the Pydio Cells web application. This allows attackers to generate valid signatures for arbitrary download URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded AWS secret keys within the client-side JavaScript code.
- Lack of server-side validation on response headers.
- Usage of presigned URLs without proper access control.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the Pydio Cells application in the victim's browser by manipulating file download URLs. This can lead to:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Stealing of user authentication tokens (JWT).
- Potentially other malicious actions if a victim opens the manipulated link, as the attacker can inject arbitrary javascript within the Pydio Cells application context.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker uploads a malicious HTML file to the Pydio Cells instance.
- The attacker modifies the download URL to serve the HTML file inline (using `response-content-disposition: inline` and `response-content-type: text/html`).
- The attacker uses the hardcoded secrets to generate a valid signature for the modified URL.
- When a victim opens the crafted URL in their browser, the included Javascript code is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files to a Pydio Cells instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the JavaScript source code to extract the hardcoded AWS credentials.
