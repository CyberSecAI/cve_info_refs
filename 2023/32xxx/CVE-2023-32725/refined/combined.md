| CVSS vector | <https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H> |
| Summary | Leak of zbx\_session cookie when using a scheduled report that includes a dashboard with a URL widget. |
| Description | The website configured in the URL widget will receive a session cookie when testing or executing scheduled reports. The received session cookie can then be used to access the frontend as the particular user. |
| Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) | CWE-565 Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking |
| Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) | CAPEC-593 Session Hijacking CAPEC-233 Privilege Escalation |

The attacker can use the cookie to pretend to be the Zabbix user who created the report and authorize himself in Zabbix frontend with the privileges of this user. Note that scheduled reports are available to Admin and Super admin user types. |
