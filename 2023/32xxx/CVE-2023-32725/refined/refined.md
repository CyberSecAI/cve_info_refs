- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Zabbix server leaks the `zbx_session` cookie when generating scheduled reports that include a dashboard with a URL widget. The URL specified in the widget receives the user's session cookie during report generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Session cookie leakage to external URLs.
    - Reliance on cookies without sufficient validation and integrity checking (CWE-565).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who controls the URL specified in the URL widget can obtain the `zbx_session` cookie. This cookie can then be used to impersonate the Zabbix user who created the scheduled report and gain access to the Zabbix frontend with the user's privileges. This constitutes a privilege escalation (CAPEC-233). This can lead to full system compromise, including sensitive data theft, malicious configuration changes, and more.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker configures a malicious URL in a URL widget on a Zabbix dashboard.
    - A scheduled report is generated that includes this dashboard.
    - The attacker's malicious URL receives the `zbx_session` cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be a Zabbix user capable of creating or modifying dashboards and URL widgets.
    - The attacker needs to control a server accessible via the URL widget.
    - The attacker needs to receive the leaked `zbx_session` cookie from the server they control.
    - The attacker needs to be able to use the leaked session cookie to access the Zabbix frontend.
