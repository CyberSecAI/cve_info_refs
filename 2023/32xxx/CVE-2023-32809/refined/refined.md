  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper access control of the register interface in the bluetooth driver.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The bluetooth driver lacks proper access controls for the register interface, allowing read and write access to registers.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local leak of sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation through the bluetooth driver.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs System execution privileges. User interaction is not needed."
