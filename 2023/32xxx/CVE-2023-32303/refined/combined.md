[2.0.1](/planetlabs/planet-client-python/tree/2.0.1)

[`5f2e881`](/planetlabs/planet-client-python/commit/5f2e8811805d8f1bd651644c10a5d9c4d79efe54)

Fixed:

* Fix security issue where secret file was being created with read access other

  users on the machine. Automatically fixes the file permissions to only read

  and write the first time the file is accessed and continues to enforce the

  proper file permissions going forward.

Docs:

* Fixed broken links on "CLI for Data API Tutorial" page ([#952](https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/pull/952)).
* Protect against injecting javascript:URI into edited href tags in docs ([#934](https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/pull/934)).
* Remove --pre --user from pip install instructions ([#948](https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/pull/948)).
* Update the syntax of example code in the docstrings in the Order and Data

  clients and add example code to the Subscriptions client docstring ([#943](https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/pull/943)).

# secret file is created with excessive permissions

Moderate

[jreiberkyle](/jreiberkyle)
published
GHSA-j5fj-rfh6-qj85
May 12, 2023

## Package

pip

planet
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

=<2.0.0

## Patched versions

2.0.1

## Description

### Impact

The secret file stores the user's Planet API authentication information. It should only be accessible by the user, but its permissions allowed the user's group and non-group to read the file as well.

### Validation

Check the permissions on the secret file with `ls -l ~/.planet.json` and ensure that they read as `-rw-------`

### Patches

[d71415a8](https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/commit/d71415a83119c5e89d7b80d5f940d162376ee3b7)

### Workarounds

Set the secret file permissions to only user read/write by hand:

```
chmod 600 ~/.planet.json

```

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
