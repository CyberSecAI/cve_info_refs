- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the unsafe use of reflection, which allows an authenticated user to invoke a Java constructor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application allows invocation of Java constructors with either no arguments or a single Map argument for any Java class available on the IdentityIQ application's classpath, which provides a potential attack vector.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to invoke arbitrary Java constructors which could lead to sensitive data access or even remote code execution. Although the CVSS score is high, the attack vector is "Authenticated" which means an attacker will first need to have valid access to the application
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network based and requires low level privileges. The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a crafted request that triggers the reflection mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user of the IdentityIQ application. They would need to be able to make requests to the application in order to exploit this vulnerability.
