# Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability in Reports

High

[anuko](/anuko)
published
GHSA-758x-vg7g-j9j3
May 12, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 1.22.13.5792

## Patched versions

1.22.13.5792

## Description

### Impact

Time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability existed in Time Tracker reports in versions prior to 1.22.13.5792. This was happening because the reports.php page was not validating all parameters in POST requests. Because some parameters were not checked, it was possible to craft a POST request with malicious SQL for Time Tracker database.

### Patches

Fixed in version 1.22.13.5792.

### Workarounds

Upgrade is highly recommended. If it is not practical, use fixed code in ttReportHelper.class.php from version 1.22.13.5792.

### References

More information is available on Anuko website at <https://www.anuko.com/time-tracker/news/time-based-blind-sql-injection-in-reports.htm>

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-32306
