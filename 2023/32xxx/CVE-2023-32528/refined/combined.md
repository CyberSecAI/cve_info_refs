| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Trend Micro Mobile Security for Enterprises. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.  The specific flaw exists within the getWidgetPoolManager function defined within the web/widgetforsecurity path. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data prior to passing it to a PHP include function. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of IUSR. |
