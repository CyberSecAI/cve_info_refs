Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data before it's passed to a PHP `include` function within the `getWidgetPoolManager` function located in the `web/widgetforsecurity` path of Trend Micro Mobile Security for Enterprises.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include arbitrary files due to the lack of sanitization of user input before being used in a php include function, which is used in `getWidgetPoolManager` function.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** When combined with other vulnerabilities (like authentication bypass and unrestricted file upload) this LFI can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The advisory mentions that the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed, allowing attackers to access the vulnerable endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of IUSR user. This could lead to full system compromise.
- **Information Disclosure:** By combining the LFI with other vulnerabilities, attackers can potentially access sensitive information from the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- The specific vulnerable function is `getWidgetPoolManager` located under the `web/widgetforsecurity` path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Low-Privileged Access**: The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system or needs to be able to bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Trend Micro Mobile Security for Enterprises 9.8 SP5.
- The vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities (like authentication bypass and file upload vulnerabilities) to achieve remote code execution with the privileges of the IUSR user.
- Trend Micro has released a patch (9.8 SP5 Critical Patch B3294) to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-CAN-20181.
- The CVSS score is 7.5, with a vector string of AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.  The other source has a CVSSv3 score of 7.7 with AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L.
