Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-32203:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files (specifically HMI files) in the affected application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) at memory location `CScape_EnvisionRV+0x2e374b`.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the parsing of maliciously crafted project files (HMI files).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a maliciously crafted HMI file to the affected application, which usually requires local access since the file is loaded by the user. The user must then open the malicious file with the vulnerable software.
