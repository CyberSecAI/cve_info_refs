**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files (e.g., HMI).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CWE-787) at `CScape_EnvisionRV+0x2e3c04`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a maliciously crafted project file (e.g., HMI).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to provide a malicious HMI file. The attack has low complexity and requires user interaction (opening the malicious file).
The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but requires local access to the system.
