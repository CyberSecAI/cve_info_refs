**Vulnerability:** Missing permission check in SAML Single Sign On(SSO) Plugin

**Root cause:** The SAML Single Sign On (SSO) Plugin does not perform permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Missing permission check
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers with Overall/Read permission can send an HTTP request to an attacker-specified URL and parse the response as XML.
- Attackers can parse a local file on the Jenkins controller as XML.
- Attackers can exploit the XXE vulnerability to extract secrets from the Jenkins controller or perform server-side request forgery.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious URL
- Sending a crafted HTTP request to parse a local file
- Utilizing crafted XML responses to exploit XXE

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Overall/Read permission
- Ability to send crafted HTTP requests

**Additional details:**
- The plugin's XML parser does not prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
- The affected HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in SAML Single Sign On(SSO) Plugin 2.0.2 and earlier.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in SAML Single Sign On(SSO) Plugin 2.1.0, which requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected HTTP endpoints.
