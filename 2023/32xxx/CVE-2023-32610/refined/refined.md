Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a Regular expression Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) flaw in the Mailform Pro CGI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service):** The application's regular expression processing is susceptible to a ReDoS attack. This occurs when a poorly designed regular expression can take an excessively long time to process certain crafted input strings, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, potentially making the affected service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- The vulnerability exists within the `prefcode/prefcode.js` add-on of Mailform Pro CGI, which is related to the automatic address entry from ZIP code functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests over the network to the vulnerable application.
- **Crafted Input:** The attacker must provide a specially crafted input string to trigger the vulnerable regular expression and cause the DoS.
- **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Mailform Pro CGI version 4.3.1.2 and earlier, specifically when the `prefcode/prefcode.js` add-on is enabled.
- The vulnerability was reported by Tran Quang Vu of FPT Software.
- The vendor has released a patch to address the issue.
- The CVSS v3 score is 3.7, with an attack complexity of High, and a low impact on availability.
- The CVSS v2 score is 4.3 with a medium complexity and potential impact on availability.
