**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `user_oidc` app for Nextcloud was missing brute-force protection on its authentication endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of rate limiting or other brute-force protection mechanisms on the login endpoints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers could potentially brute-force user credentials to gain unauthorized access to accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks.
- Attackers can make repeated login attempts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the Nextcloud instance where the `user_oidc` app is installed.
- The attacker needs to target the applicationâ€™s login endpoints.
