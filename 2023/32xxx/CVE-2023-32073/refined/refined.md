Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-32073:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `plugin/CloneSite/cloneClient.json.php` file of WWBN AVideo. The `$objClone->cloneSiteURL` parameter, used in a `wget` command, is not properly sanitized before being passed to the `exec()` function, allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The lack of proper sanitization of the `$objClone->cloneSiteURL` variable allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the `wget` command executed by the `exec()` function.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The application fails to adequately validate and sanitize user-provided input, specifically the `cloneSiteURL`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the vulnerable AVideo instance, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious `cloneSiteURL` that contains embedded shell commands. This URL is then submitted via the CloneSite plugin.
- The `wget` command, constructed using the unsanitized URL, is then executed, leading to the execution of the attacker's injected commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user with access to the CloneSite plugin functionality.
- Ability to manipulate the `cloneSiteURL` parameter.
- The attacker needs to be able to make a request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional details:**
- The provided exploit proof-of-concept demonstrates how to set up a server to serve a JSON response and then provides an example `cloneSiteURL` with a netcat command injection.
- The exploit specifically uses `$IFS` in place of spaces, which is required for the exploit to work correctly.
- This vulnerability is a bypass to the fix for CVE-2023-30854.
