  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The server did not check if a user was authorized to join a specific organization when processing profile update requests. While the UI restricted the user's view to their existing organization(s), the server blindly accepted the organization ID sent in the request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient authorization checks on the server-side when processing profile updates."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can add themselves to any organization in CloudExplorer Lite, which can potentially grant unauthorized access to resources and data within that organization.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker intercepts the profile update request using a tool like Burp Suite and modifies the organization ID in the request.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be an authenticated user within the system. They also need the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., through a proxy tool)."
