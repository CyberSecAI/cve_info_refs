The provided content is related to CVE-2023-32652.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The PiiGAB M-Bus software does not validate identification strings before processing them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session. This can lead to the theft of sensitive information, session hijacking, or the execution of malicious commands.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely with low attack complexity, and requires a user to interact with a crafted link (User Interaction is Required). An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the unvalidated identification strings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject a malicious script into a parameter, and the victim needs to be a logged-in user to execute the script.
