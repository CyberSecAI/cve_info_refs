refactor: optimize calldatasize check ([#3104](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/3104))

```
this changes the calldatasize check from a global/contract-entry check
to a function-local check - the calldatasize check only needs to be
present if a selector is 0. this maintains the invariant protecting
against the bug in [#1603](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/1603) while being more efficient.

# nonpayable default functions can sometimes be sent ether with calldatasize<4

Low

[charles-cooper](/charles-cooper)
published
GHSA-vxmm-cwh2-q762
May 19, 2023

## Package

pip

vyper
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=0.3.7

## Patched versions

0.3.8

## Description

### Impact

in contracts with at least one regular nonpayable function, due to the callvalue check being inside of the selector section, it is possible to send funds to the default function by using less than 4 bytes of calldata, even if the default function is marked `nonpayable`. this applies to contracts compiled with vyper<=0.3.7.

```
# @version 0.3.7

# implicitly nonpayable
@external
def foo() -> uint256:
    return 1

# implicitly nonpayable
@external
def __default__():
    # could receive ether here
    pass
```
### Patches

this was fixed by the removal of the global calldatasize check in [02339df](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/02339dfda0f3caabad142060d511d10bfe93c520).

### Workarounds

don't use nonpayable default functions

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-32675

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
