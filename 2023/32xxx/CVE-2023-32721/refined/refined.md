Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-32721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found within the Zabbix web application. Specifically, the flaw exists in the "Maps" element of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness is the improper handling of user-supplied input within the "URL field" of the Maps element.
- Spaces before a URL in the URL field are not properly sanitized, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.
- This results in a stored XSS vulnerability which means the malicious script is stored on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- The impact can range from session hijacking, user impersonation, or client-side attacks which allows for the theft of cookies/session info, performing actions on behalf of the user, or redirecting the user to another site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Zabbix web application's Maps element.
- An attacker would need to insert malicious code into the URL field when configuring a map element. This could be done if an attacker has access to configure the Zabbix UI or social engineering a user to enter the malicious code.
- Once the map element containing the malicious code is viewed, the XSS is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to modify/create map elements within the Zabbix web application. This could be achieved through having a low-privileged user account or by compromising a higher privileged user.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of XSS vulnerabilities and how to craft an XSS payload.
- The victim needs to view a map containing the malicious payload.

- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 7.6 (High).
- The vulnerability is reported by "prasetia" through the HackerOne platform.
