**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to improper validation of user-supplied strings within the `dbCert` parameter of `set_certificates_config` requests to the `modTMMS` endpoint. This lack of validation allows for the injection of malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution in the context of the IUSR user on affected Trend Micro Apex Central installations.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks, specifically by sending crafted `set_certificates_config` requests to the `modTMMS` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated access to the Trend Micro Apex Central system. An attacker must first obtain valid credentials.
