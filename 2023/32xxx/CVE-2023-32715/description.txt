In the Splunk App for Lookup File Editing versions below 4.0.1, a user can insert potentially malicious JavaScript code into the app, which causes that code to run on the userâ€™s machine. The app itself does not contain the potentially malicious JavaScript code. The vulnerability requires the attacker to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser, and requires additional user interaction to trigger. The attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability at will.
