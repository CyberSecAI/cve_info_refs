- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. Specifically, the plugin lacks proper checks to ensure users have the necessary permissions to perform certain actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unprivileged users (Subscribers) can perform actions that should be restricted to higher-level users. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or other malicious activities, depending on the specific function that is vulnerable.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the vulnerable function in the plugin where access control is not properly implemented.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber on the WordPress site. They do not require any other special privileges.
