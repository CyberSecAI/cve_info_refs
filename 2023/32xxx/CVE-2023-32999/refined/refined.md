The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-32999.

**CVE-2023-32999**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The AppSpider Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**:
    *   Missing permission check
    *   Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL and send an HTTP POST request with a JSON payload consisting of attacker-specified credentials.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   Network-based attacks
    *   Attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request with a JSON payload
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins instance

The AppSpider plugin versions up to 1.0.15 are affected. The fix is included in version 1.0.16, which requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation method.
