Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check within a function of the WRC Pricing Tables WordPress plugin. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly validate user permissions before allowing access to certain functionalities.
- **Missing Authorization Checks:** The absence of authorization checks enables unauthenticated users to perform privileged actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (even an unauthenticated one) can perform actions they should not be authorized to do. The specific impact varies depending on the specific function that is vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, since no authentication is needed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to have any special privileges, they can be unauthenticated.
-  The attacker needs to know what functions are vulnerable to the broken access control.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3, which is considered low severity.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.3.8.
- A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the issue before updating the plugin.
