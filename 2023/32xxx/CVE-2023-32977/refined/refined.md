Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-32977:

**CVE-2023-32977:**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** Pipeline: Job Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1292.v27d8cc3e2602 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not properly escape the display name of a build that caused an earlier build to be aborted when the "Do not allow concurrent builds" option is set.
*   **Weakness:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:** An attacker who can set build display names can inject malicious scripts that are executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the build status page. This can lead to account compromise or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to set a malicious display name of a build.  This is a build that must cause an earlier build to be aborted.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to set build display names. The advisory notes that the Jenkins security team is not aware of any plugins that allow exploitation of this vulnerability, as the build name must be set before the build starts.
*   **Fix:** Update to Pipeline: Job Plugin version 1295.v395eb\_7400005 which escapes the build display name.
