- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command within the DHCP Client Functionality of Synology Router Manager (SRM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: Man-in-the-middle attackers can execute arbitrary commands.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs via unspecified vectors within the DHCP Client Functionality. The attack requires a man-in-the-middle position.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a man-in-the-middle position on the network and have the ability to manipulate DHCP traffic.
