- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Apache server-status page, which contains sensitive information about the server, was accessible to the public by default after Landscape installation. The server was proxying requests to the local mod_status from the outside.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information due to the server-status page being publicly accessible. This included details about current hosts and requests, number of workers, CPU utilization, and potentially API keys or URLs to private documents within the request path or URL. Additionally, the API used GET parameters for sending secrets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could obtain sensitive information from the server-status page, including client IP addresses and API keys. They could also repeat API requests made by legitimate users, potentially gaining access to private information or performing unauthorized actions such as rebooting computers.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could access the `/server-status` endpoint of a Landscape server, without requiring any authentication, if the default configuration was not changed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable server's /server-status endpoint over the network.
