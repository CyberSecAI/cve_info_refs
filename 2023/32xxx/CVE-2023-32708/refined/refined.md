**Root cause of vulnerability:** The 'rest' SPL command in Splunk is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting. This is because the command allows user-controlled input to be included in HTTP headers, without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  *   **HTTP Response Splitting (CWE-113):** The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-controlled input when constructing HTTP responses. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTTP headers or even an entire response.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  *   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can potentially access restricted REST endpoints, enabling them to view or modify sensitive information. This includes viewing restricted content like password files.
  *   **Arbitrary REST Endpoint Access:** The attacker can gain arbitrary access to other REST endpoints within the system.

**Attack vectors:**
  *   The vulnerability is triggered by a low-privileged user executing the vulnerable 'rest' SPL command.
  *   The attacker injects malicious HTTP headers (e.g. `\r\n`) within the ‘rest’ command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  *   The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to execute SPL commands.
  *   The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable 'rest' SPL command and the ability to craft malicious HTTP header injections.
