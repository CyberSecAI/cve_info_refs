    "CVE-2023-32323": {
      "status": "relevant",
      "details": {
        "root cause": "The Matrix protocol allows homeservers to provide an `invite_room_state` field on a room invite containing a summary of room state. Synapse versions up to and including v1.73.0 did not limit the size of `invite_room_state`, allowing for the creation of arbitrarily large invite events.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Lack of input validation on the size of the `invite_room_state` field within Matrix room invite events."
        ],
        "impact": "A malicious user can disable outbound federation from a Synapse homeserver X to an arbitrary homeserver Y. By creating an oversized invite event, they can cause X's outgoing traffic to Y to become \"stuck\", preventing messages and state events from being seen by Y.",
        "attack vector": "An attacker with an account on a vulnerable Synapse homeserver X can create an oversized invite event in a room with a user from another homeserver Y.",
        "attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs an account on a vulnerable Synapse homeserver with permission to create certain state events (room invites). They do not require any user interaction on the target homeserver.",
         "additional_information": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling open registration on the vulnerable server. Restarting the server can temporarily restore federation, but the attacker can re-exploit the vulnerability unless it is patched. The issue was originally reported as a federation breakage between two specific homeservers."
