### Description

federation between my homeserver and matrix.org was broken. My homeserver was able to send messages but messages sent from matrix.org were never received. I was not the only server affected by this issue and another homeserver admin found a solution in [#synapse-admins](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org):

This patch worked for the original author and I confirm it is working for me too. I also made sure the parameter `client_max_body_size` in my nginx reverse-proxy was high enough. Increasing the value in nginx was not enough to fix the issue, the patch above was needed. I was affected by this bug since last weekend and I did a lot of tests by changing many values in nginx by increasing timeouts and size but nothing worked. I also tried changing synapse cache values and configs but that didn't do the trick either.

### Steps to reproduce

I do not know how to reproduce the initial conditions that caused the bug but the patch fixed the federation between my server and matrix.org.

### Homeserver

matrix.org was the server unable to send messages

### Synapse Version

1.72.0rc1 for matrix and I run 1.71.0

### Installation Method

Docker (matrixdotorg/synapse)

### Platform

Ubuntu LTS and I use the Ansible playbook from <https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy>

### Relevant log output

```
here is an example of logs that I was seeing on my side:

Nov 17 21:46:19 localhost matrix-nginx-proxy[2836800]: 2022/11/18 02:46:19 [error] 30#30: *13315398 recv() failed (104: Connection reset by peer) while reading response header from upstream, client: 172.18.0.19, server: matrix-nginx-proxy, request: "PUT /_matrix/federation/v1/send/1668680027792 HTTP/1.0", upstream: "http://172.18.0.21:18111/_matrix/federation/v1/send/1668680027792", host: "matrix.anontier.nl"

here is a log that was submitted to me by a matrix developer:

# Outgoing federation to specific hosts can be disabled by sending malicious invites

Moderate

[dkasak](/dkasak)
published
GHSA-f3wc-3vxv-xmvr
May 24, 2023

## Package

pip

matrix-synapse
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<1.74.0

## Patched versions

1.74.0

## Description

### Impact

A malicious user on a Synapse homeserver X with permission to create certain state events can disable outbound federation from X to an arbitrary homeserver Y.

Synapse instances with federation disabled are not affected.

#### Details

The Matrix protocol allows homeservers to provide an `invite_room_state` field on a [room invite](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#mroommember) containing a [summary of room state](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#stripped-state). In versions of Synapse up to and including v1.73.0, Synapse did not limit the size of `invite_room_state`, meaning that it was possible to create an arbitrarily large invite event.

An attacker with an account on a vulnerable Synapse homeserver X could exploit this by having X create an over-sized invite event in a room with a user from another homeserver Y. Once acknowledged by the invitee's homeserver, the invite event would be sent in a batch of events to Y. If the malicious invite is so large that the entire batch is rejected as too large, X's outgoing traffic to Y would become "stuck", meaning that messages and state events created by X would remain unseen by Y.

### Patches

Synapse 1.74 refuses to create oversized `invite_room_state` fields. Server operators should upgrade to Synapse 1.74 or newer urgently.

### Workarounds

There are no robust workarounds.

This attack needs an account on Synapse homeserver X to deny federation from X to another homeserver Y. As a partial mitigation, Synapse operators can disable open registration to limit the ability of attackers to create new accounts on homeserver X.

If homeserver X has been attacked in this way, restarting it will resume outgoing federation by entering "catchup mode". For catchup mode to ignore the oversized invites, every attacked room must have a correctly-sized event sent by X which is newer than any oversized invite. This is difficult to arrange, and does not prevent the attacker from repeating their attack.

not sure about the need for a new type of `StateFilter` — note that the normal `StateFilter` is usable for querying only the required state from the database as well, but I trust you've considered it and have good reason

> can state\_key be None here?

Yes, if someone specifies an entry consisting only of an event type.

> do we need to guard against that?

No, it's a valid input that's explicitly handled by `.add(None)`, see

| not sure about the need for a new type of StateFilter  FWIW I don't intend for this to get used outside the config class.  I trust you've considered it and have good reason  I admit it's somewhat ideological and bordering on overkill.  The thinking: for each configured event type `T`, we either have   * a nonempty set of accepted state key strings, or * a dummy value meaning "accept any state key".   It's tempting to represent the dummy value with the empty set. But that's a bit a footgun, because the semantics don't match. E.g.   * `set{} | {"hello"}` is `{"hello"}`, meaning only the "hello" state key is allowed, * but "no restriction on state key" union "state key `hello` is permitted" is "no restriction on state key".   so this wrapper was an attempt to avoid footgunning yourself.   ---   Happy to rework this to e.g. use a different representation or to make the type more obviously private, especially if you think it's unclear as is. WDYT? |

| I think `StateFilter.from_types` does closely enough to what you want? — you give it `(type, state_key)` tuples (or `(type, None)` for all state keys of the given type).  I don't know if tests back this up, but to my eye it looks like giving it `[("type1", "sk1"), ("type1", None)]` will do the right thing regarding union behaviour and expand to `[("type1", None)]` — with None meaning 'ALL' or 'no restriction'...  I believe `StateFilter.filter_state` should also be useful to you in doing the filtering, rather than doing it yourself with `should_include`.  However it's very possible I haven't spotted something subtle which means I'm wrong |

hmph. Sounds footgunny. Might be worth looking to see if it's worth pushing `StateFilter.filter` down into `get_current_state_ids`?

Possibly it may not be (if not every caller does that for some reason).

(N.B. you don't have to — merely a suggestion if it's an easy improvement whilst in the area)

I considered it, but I'm pretty scared of the StateFilter machinery. I'll have a quick look at the call sites tomorrow

|  | If a state filter is given (that is not `StateFilter.all()`) the query |

so maybe using a StateFilter is counterproductive if it bypasses caching? (I guess it depends on how likely it is that the room's current state exists in memory, how much effort a filter saves when making the db query etc)

Anyway I think this is one to leave for a rainy day!

- Reject invalid read receipt requests with empty room or event IDs. Contributed by Nick @ Beeper (@fizzadar). ([\#14632](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14632))
- Fix a bug introduced in Synapse 1.67.0 where not specifying a config file or a server URL would lead to the `register_new_matrix_user` script failing. ([\#14637](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14637))
- Fix a long-standing bug where the user directory and room/user stats might be out of sync. ([\#14639](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14639), [\#14643](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14643))
- Fix a bug introduced in Synapse 1.72.0 where the background updates to add non-thread unique indexes on receipts would fail if they were previously interrupted. ([\#14650](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14650))
- Improve validation of field size limits in events. ([\#14664](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14664))
- Fix bugs introduced in Synapse 1.55.0 and 1.69.0 where application services would not be notified of events in the correct rooms, due to stale caches. ([\#14670](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14670))

- Remove old, incorrect minimum postgres version note and replace with a link to the [Dependency Deprecation Policy](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.73/deprecation_policy.html). ([\#14590](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14590))
- Add Single-Sign On setup instructions for Mastodon-based instances. ([\#14594](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14594))
- Change `turn_allow_guests` example value to lowercase `true`. ([\#14634](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14634))

Internal Changes
----------------

- Optimise push badge count calculations. Contributed by Nick @ Beeper (@fizzadar). ([\#14255](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14255))
- Faster remote room joins: stream the un-partial-stating of rooms over replication. ([\#14473](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14473), [\#14474](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14474))

`[Update chat/matrix-synapse to 1.76.0](/NetBSD/pkgsrc/commit/75d0625dd885c47e1426522441f72a142c52365e "Update chat/matrix-synapse to 1.76.0

Synapse 1.76.0 (2023-01-31)
===========================

The 1.76 release is the first to enable faster joins ([MSC3706](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706) and [MSC3902](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3902)) by default. Admins can opt-out: see [the upgrade notes](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.76/docs/upgrade.md#faster-joins-are-enabled-by-default) for more details.

The upgrade from 1.75 to 1.76 changes the account data replication streams in a backwards-incompatible manner. Server operators running a multi-worker deployment should consult [the upgrade notes](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.76/docs/upgrade.md#changes-to-the-account-data-replication-streams).

Those who are `poetry install`ing from source using our lockfile should ensure their poetry version is 1.3.2 or higher; [see upgrade notes](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.76/docs/upgrade.md#minimum-version-of-poetry-is-now-132).

Notes on faster joins
---------------------

The faster joins project sees the most benefit when joining a room with a large number of members (joined or historical). We expect it to be particularly useful for joining large public rooms like the [Matrix HQ](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org) or [Synapse Admins](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org) rooms.

After a faster join, Synapse considers that room \"partially joined\". In this state, you should be able to

- read incoming messages;
- see incoming state changes, e.g. room topic changes; and
- send messages, if the room is unencrypted.

Synapse has to spend more effort to complete the join in the background. Once this finishes, you will be able to

- send messages, if the room is in encrypted;
- retrieve room history from before your join, if permitted by the room settings; and
- access the full list of room members.

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Describe the ideas and the internal machinery behind faster joins. ([\#14677](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14677))

The 1.76 release is the first to enable faster joins ([MSC3706]([matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals#3706](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706)) and [MSC3902]([matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals#3902](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3902))) by default. Admins can opt-out: see [the upgrade notes](<https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.76/docs/upgrade.md#faster-joins-are-enabled-by-default>) for more details.

The upgrade from 1.75 to 1.76 changes the account data replication streams in a backwards-incompatible manner. Server operators running a multi-worker deployment should consult [the upgrade notes](<https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.76/docs/upgrade.md#changes-to-the-account-data-replication-streams>).

Those who are `poetry install`ing from source using our lockfile should ensure their poetry version is 1.3.2 or higher; [see upgrade notes](<https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.76/docs/upgrade.md#minimum-version-of-poetry-is-now-132>).

Notes on faster joins
---------------------

The faster joins project sees the most benefit when joining a room with a large number of members (joined or historical). We expect it to be particularly useful for joining large public rooms like the [Matrix HQ](<https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org>) or [Synapse Admins](<https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org>) rooms.

After a faster join, Synapse considers that room "partially joined". In this state, you should be able to

- read incoming messages;
- see incoming state changes, e.g. room topic changes; and
- send messages, if the room is unencrypted.

Synapse has to spend more effort to complete the join in the background. Once this finishes, you will be able to

- send messages, if the room is in encrypted;
- retrieve room history from before your join, if permitted by the room settings; and
- access the full list of room members.

Improved Documentation
