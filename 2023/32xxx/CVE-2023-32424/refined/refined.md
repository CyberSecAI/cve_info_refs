**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an issue with memory handling in the Kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass kernel memory mitigations. This indicates a flaw in how the kernel protects memory from unauthorized access after code execution is achieved.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who has already achieved kernel code execution can bypass kernel memory mitigations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have already achieved kernel code execution before being able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have already achieved kernel code execution. This implies a prior vulnerability needs to have been exploited.

**Affected Products:**
- Apple Watch Series 4 and later (watchOS 9.4)
- iPhone 8 and later (iOS 16.4)
- iPad Pro (all models) (iPadOS 16.4)
- iPad Air 3rd generation and later (iPadOS 16.4)
