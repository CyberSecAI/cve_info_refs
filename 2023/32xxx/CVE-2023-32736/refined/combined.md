Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SSA-871035: Session-Memory Deserialization Vulnerability in Siemens Engineering Platforms Before V19

| Publication Date: | 2024-11-12 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2025-01-14 |
| Current Version: | V1.1 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.3 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.0 |

SUMMARY

Affected products do not properly sanitize user-controllable input when parsing files. This could allow an attacker to cause a type confusion and execute arbitrary code within the affected application.

Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens recommends countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC S7-PLCSIM simulates S7-1200, S7-1500 and a few other PLC derivatives and is shipped as part of SIMATIC STEP 7.

SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) is an engineering software to configure and program SIMATIC controllers.

SIMOCODE ES is the central software package for the configuration, commissioning, operation, and diagnosis of SIMOCODE pro.
The software is based on the Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) central engineering framework and can be seamlessly integrated if additional TIA Portal-based software such as STEP 7 and WinCC is present.

SINAMICS Startdrive commissioning software is the engineering tool for integration of SINAMICS drives in TIA Portal.

Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) is a PC software that provides access to the complete range of Siemens digitalized automation services, from digital planning and integrated engineering to transparent operation.

TIA Portal Cloud makes it possible to use the main packages as well as the main option packages of TIA Portal in a virtualized environment. Local projects can be transferred to the cloud and loaded back again via a file share service.
