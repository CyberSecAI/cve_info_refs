The provided content relates to **CVE-2023-32989**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Azure VM Agents Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints. Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified Azure Cloud server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method. An attacker can also make a user perform unwanted actions via CSRF.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission to exploit the missing permission check vulnerability and needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious site to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.
