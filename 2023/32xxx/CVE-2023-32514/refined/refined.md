- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Google Site Verification plugin using Meta Tag plugin <= 1.2 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or control within the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by crafting malicious requests that are executed when a logged-in user interacts with them. This interaction is typically done through tricking the user via a link or a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into clicking a crafted malicious link or visiting a malicious website that triggers the forged request. The attacker also needs to know the actions the plugin performs and be able to craft the appropriate malicious request.
