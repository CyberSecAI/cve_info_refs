- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files (e.g., CSP).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: By opening a maliciously crafted project file (CSP).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to make the user open a malicious project file using the vulnerable software.
