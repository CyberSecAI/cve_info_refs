- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control related to Category Option Combination sharing settings. The `/trackedEntityInstances` and `/events` API endpoints were not correctly enforcing these sharing settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from the API endpoints (`/trackedEntityInstances` and `/events`) failing to respect the sharing configurations applied to Category Option Combinations when retrieving data.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Users might gain unauthorized access to event data that they should not be able to see based on sharing settings.
    - While these events are not visible in web-based Tracker Capture or Capture applications, they are accessible through the Android Capture App.
- **Attack vectors**: API endpoints (`/trackedEntityInstances` and `/events`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be a user with access to the DHIS2 instance, but lacks the authorization to view specific events.
    - Access to the Android Capture App is required to exploit the full impact of the vulnerability.
