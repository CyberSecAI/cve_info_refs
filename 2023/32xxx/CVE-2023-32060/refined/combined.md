# Improper Access Control with Category Option Combination sharing in /api/trackedEntityInstance and /api/events

High

[michael-markevich](/michael-markevich)
published
GHSA-7pwm-6rh2-2388
May 8, 2023

## Package

dhis2-core
(dhis2)

## Affected versions

> 2.35

## Patched versions

2.36.13, 2.37.8, 2.38.2, 2.39.0

## Description

### Impact

When the Category Option Combination Sharing settings are configured to control access to specific tracker program events or program stages, the `/trackedEntityInstances` and `/events` API endpoints may include all events regardless of the sharing settings applied to the category option combinations.

When this specific configuration is present, users may have access to events which they should not be able to see based on the sharing settings of the category options. The events will not appear in the user interface for web-based Tracker Capture or Capture applications, but if the Android Capture App is used they will be displayed to the user.

### Workarounds

No workaround is known at this stage.
