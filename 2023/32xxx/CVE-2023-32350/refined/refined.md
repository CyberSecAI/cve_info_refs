Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-32350:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the Teltonika RUT router.

**Attack vectors:**
-  An attacker can inject malicious OS commands through a parameter in a vulnerable Lua service by providing a specially crafted package name containing the injection payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Teltonika RUT router.
- The attacker needs to have adjacent network access to the router.

**Affected Products:**
- Teltonika RUT model routers: Version 00.07.00 through 00.07.03.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in a Lua service.
- A user-provided package name is used in a function call, and this parameter is vulnerable to OS command injection if a malicious package name is supplied.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 8.0, with the vector string (AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). This means that the vulnerability is exploitable with adjacent network access, low attack complexity, low privileges, requires no user interaction, and has high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
