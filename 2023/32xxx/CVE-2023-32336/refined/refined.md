- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A remote code execution vulnerability exists in IBM InfoSphere Information Server. The specific root cause within the software is not detailed in this document, but the suggested mitigation implies it relates to how the RMI service handles objects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a remote code execution flaw, meaning an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain control of the server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) service, suggesting network-based exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the RMI service and possess the capability to exploit the object handling weakness.
