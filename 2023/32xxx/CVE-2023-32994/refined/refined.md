The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, and one of them is related to CVE-2023-32994.

**CVE-2023-32994:**

*   **Root Cause:** The SAML Single Sign On(SSO) Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for connections to miniOrange or the configured IdP to retrieve SAML metadata.
*   **Weakness:** Unconditional disabling of SSL/TLS certificate validation.
*   **Impact:** A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack could be used to intercept these connections, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or manipulation of the authentication process.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Jenkins server and the miniOrange or the configured IdP. The attacker does not need any specific user privileges.
