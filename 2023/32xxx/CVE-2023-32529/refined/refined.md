**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of user-supplied strings when parsing the `id` parameter within the `delete_cert_vec` requests to the `modTMMS` endpoint in Trend Micro Apex Central. This lack of validation allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user-provided input before using it to construct SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected server in the context of the IUSR user.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (remote).
*   The specific vulnerable endpoint is `modTMMS` processing `delete_cert_vec` requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication Required:**  The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the Trend Micro Apex Central system before exploiting this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-23-652 and ZDI-CAN-17688.
*   The CVSSv3 score is 7.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating a high severity.
