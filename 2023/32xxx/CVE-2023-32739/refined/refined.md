- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress WP Custom Cursors plugin versions prior to 3.2 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. This can vary case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could use a malicious website or email to trick a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting a crafted request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in, privileged user to make an unwanted action. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
