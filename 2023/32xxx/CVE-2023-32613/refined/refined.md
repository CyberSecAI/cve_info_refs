- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Exposure of resource to wrong sphere.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The device exposes functions that should only be available after login, to unauthenticated users. This is a CWE-668 vulnerability, which means that the resource is exposed to a wider audience than intended.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can use functions that should only be available after logging in without being authenticated. The impact is limited to information disclosure, specifically the attacker may obtain a password for the wireless network (this is further described in CVE-2023-32620).
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to be on the same local network as the device to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device but does not need any credentials or prior authentication.
