- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows open redirects via the `/redirect` endpoint using the `next_url` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unvalidated URL parameters are used in a redirect, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to conduct phishing attacks to steal Landscape credentials, which could then be used to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) on multiple endpoints registered in the victim's Landscape account.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific URL with the `/redirect` path and a malicious URL in the `next_url` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and entice a user to click on it. No specific privileges or access to the server are needed.
