# Unintended leak of Proxy-Authorization header

Moderate

[nateprewitt](/nateprewitt)
published
GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q
May 22, 2023

## Package

pip

requests
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 2.3.0, < 2.31.0

## Patched versions

2.31.0

## Description

### Impact

Since Requests v2.3.0, Requests has been vulnerable to potentially leaking `Proxy-Authorization` headers to destination servers, specifically during redirects to an HTTPS origin. This is a product of how `rebuild_proxies` is used to recompute and [reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/sessions.py#L319-L328) to requests when redirected. Note this behavior has *only* been observed to affect proxied requests when credentials are supplied in the URL user information component (e.g. `https://username:password@proxy:8080`).

**Current vulnerable behavior(s):**

1. HTTP → HTTPS: **leak**
2. HTTPS → HTTP: **no leak**
3. HTTPS → HTTPS: **leak**
4. HTTP → HTTP: **no leak**

For HTTP connections sent through the proxy, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into further tunneled requests. This results in Requests forwarding the header to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate those credentials.

The reason this currently works for HTTPS connections in Requests is the `Proxy-Authorization` header is also handled by urllib3 with our usage of the ProxyManager in adapters.py with [`proxy_manager_for`](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/adapters.py#L199-L235). This will compute the required proxy headers in `proxy_headers` and pass them to the Proxy Manager, avoiding attaching them directly to the Request object. This will be our preferred option going forward for default usage.

### Patches

Starting in Requests v2.31.0, Requests will no longer attach this header to redirects with an HTTPS destination. This should have no negative impacts on the default behavior of the library as the proxy credentials are already properly being handled by urllib3's ProxyManager.

For users with custom adapters, this *may* be potentially breaking if you were already working around this behavior. The previous functionality of `rebuild_proxies` doesn't make sense in any case, so we would encourage any users impacted to migrate any handling of Proxy-Authorization directly into their custom adapter.

### Workarounds

For users who are not able to update Requests immediately, there is one potential workaround.

You may disable redirects by setting `allow_redirects` to `False` on all calls through Requests top-level APIs. Note that if you're currently relying on redirect behaviors, you will need to capture the 3xx response codes and ensure a new request is made to the redirect destination.

```
import requests
r = requests.get('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=False)

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## 2.31.0 (2023-05-22)

**Security**

* Versions of Requests between v2.3.0 and v2.30.0 are vulnerable to potential

  forwarding of `Proxy-Authorization` headers to destination servers when

  following HTTPS redirects.

  When proxies are defined with user info (<https://user:pass@proxy:8080>), Requests

  will construct a `Proxy-Authorization` header that is attached to the request to

  authenticate with the proxy.

  In cases where Requests receives a redirect response, it previously reattached

  the `Proxy-Authorization` header incorrectly, resulting in the value being

  sent through the tunneled connection to the destination server. Users who rely on

  defining their proxy credentials in the URL are *strongly* encouraged to upgrade

  to Requests 2.31.0+ to prevent unintentional leakage and rotate their proxy

  credentials once the change has been fully deployed.

  Users who do not use a proxy or do not supply their proxy credentials through

  the user information portion of their proxy URL are not subject to this

  vulnerability.

  Full details can be read in our [Github Security Advisory](https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q)

  and [CVE-2023-32681](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32681).

# Requests: Information Leak — GLSA **202309-08**

A vulnerability has been discovered in Requests which could result in the disclosure of plaintext secrets.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-python/requests** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.31.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.31.0** |

### Background

Requests is an HTTP library for human beings.

### Description

Requests is vulnerable to potentially leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers, specifically during redirects to an HTTPS origin with authentication credentials encoded into the URL.

### Impact

Users' proxy authentication secrets could be disclosed to parties beyond the used HTTP proxy server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Requests users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-python/requests-2.31.0"

```

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-078e257f1c
2023-05-27 01:25:15.781137

Name : python-requests
Product : Fedora 37
Version : 2.28.1
Release : 3.fc37
URL : <https://pypi.io/project/requests>

Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely verbose and
cumbersome. Python���s built-in urllib2 module provides most of the HTTP
capabilities you should need, but the API is thoroughly broken. This library is
designed to make HTTP requests easy for developers.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3456-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : requests
Version        : 2.21.0-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-32681
Debian Bug     : 1036693

Requests, a Python HTTP library, has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers
to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. For HTTP
connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the
request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server.
However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in
the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request.
This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination
server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate
sensitive information.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
2.21.0-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your requests packages.

For the detailed security status of requests please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/requests>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
