Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `rebuild_proxies` function in the `requests` library incorrectly re-attaching the `Proxy-Authorization` header during redirects to HTTPS destinations. This header, intended for proxy authentication, was being sent to the destination server instead of being confined to the proxy connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unintended Header Leakage:** The primary issue is the unintended transmission of the `Proxy-Authorization` header to the destination server during HTTPS redirects when using proxies with credentials embedded in the URL.
*   **Incorrect Header Handling:** The library's logic for handling the `Proxy-Authorization` header in redirects was flawed, causing it to be added to the redirected request when it should not have been.
*   **Reliance on URL Credentials:** The vulnerability is triggered when proxy credentials are provided within the URL's user information component (e.g., `http://user:pass@proxy:8080`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** A malicious actor could potentially intercept the leaked `Proxy-Authorization` header, allowing them to exfiltrate proxy credentials which can be used to access internal networks or other protected resources.
*  **Confidentiality Breach**: The proxy authentication secrets could be disclosed to parties beyond the used HTTP proxy server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Redirects:** The vulnerability is triggered when an HTTP request is redirected to an HTTPS URL. This includes both HTTP to HTTPS and HTTPS to HTTPS scenarios.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Position (or Destination Server control):** An attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic or control the destination server to capture the leaked `Proxy-Authorization` header.
*   **Proxy Usage:** The user must be using a proxy, and their proxy credentials must be embedded directly in the proxy URL.

**Additional Information:**

*   The issue affects versions of `requests` between v2.3.0 and v2.30.0.
*   The fix is included in version 2.31.0 and later, where the header is not attached to redirected HTTPS destinations.
*   Workarounds include disabling redirects or migrating handling of `Proxy-Authorization` to custom adapters.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "Moderate" severity.
