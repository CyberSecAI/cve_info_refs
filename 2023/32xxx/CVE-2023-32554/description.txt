A Time-of-Check Time-Of-Use vulnerability in the Trend Micro Apex One and Apex One as a Service agent could allow a local attacker to escalate privileges on affected installations.

Please note: a local attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.

This is similar to, but not identical to CVE-2023-32555.
