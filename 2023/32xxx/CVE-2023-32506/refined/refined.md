- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, leading to broken access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. An unprivileged user can execute actions that require higher privileges due to the lack of proper access control checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could execute higher privileged actions. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**: Unauthenticated users can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
