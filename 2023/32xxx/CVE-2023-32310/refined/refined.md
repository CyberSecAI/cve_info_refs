Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-32310:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the DataEase API, specifically in the interfaces for deleting dashboard shares and system messages. The system doesn't properly validate if the user making the request has the required privileges to delete the targeted resource.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):** The application uses direct object references (IDs) without proper authorization checks, allowing attackers to manipulate these references to access or modify resources belonging to other users.
*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The system lacks proper authorization checks before performing delete operations on dashboard shares and system messages.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system doesn't validate if the user has the right permissions to delete shared dashboards or messages associated with other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Deletion of Dashboard Shares:** An attacker can delete the shared links of dashboards belonging to other users by manipulating the dashboard ID in the request. This can lead to disruptions in access and collaboration.
*   **Unauthorized Deletion of System Messages:** An attacker can delete system messages of other users by simply enumerating the message IDs. This can lead to loss of important information and potential disruption of communication.
*   **Unauthorized Marking of Messages as Read:** An attacker can mark messages as read for other users without their consent, potentially hiding messages and their content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API Manipulation:** An attacker can intercept API requests (e.g., using Burp Suite) and modify the object IDs in the request to target other users' resources.
*   **ID Enumeration:** An attacker can guess or enumerate the message IDs to delete or mark as read messages that don't belong to them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the DataEase system.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the API endpoints used for deleting dashboard shares and system messages.
*   **Ability to Intercept/Modify Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests. This can be achieved with tools such as Burp Suite.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in DataEase version 1.18.7.
*   The vulnerability affects versions 1.18.6 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `ShareService.java` file.
*   The commit `72f428e87b5395c03d2f94ef6185fc247ddbc8dc` fixes the IDOR vulnerability related to dashboard sharing.
* The vulnerability is identified as GHSA-7hv6-gv38-78wj
