- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability due to a lack of proper locking when performing operations on a file within the Apex One Client Plug-in Service Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: TOCTOU vulnerability, improper file locking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access required to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
