The provided document contains information about multiple CVEs, and this response focuses on **CVE-2023-32991**.

**CVE-2023-32991** relates to a **CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks** in the **SAML Single Sign On(SSO) Plugin**.

**Root Cause:**

*   The SAML Single Sign On(SSO) Plugin does not perform permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints.
*   These HTTP endpoints also do not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Permission Checks:** Attackers with Overall/Read permissions can access the vulnerable HTTP endpoints.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The lack of POST request requirements for the HTTP endpoints enables CSRF attacks.
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Attack:** The plugin parses XML responses without properly configuring its parser, making it vulnerable to XXE attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can send HTTP requests to an attacker-specified URL and parse the response as XML, or parse a local file on the Jenkins controller as XML, potentially leading to extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The ability to parse arbitrary XML responses can be leveraged to perform SSRF.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Combined with other vulnerabilities, it can lead to increased access to sensitive information/functionality within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.
*   **User Interaction:**  The CSRF component requires a user to visit a malicious site or click a malicious link that triggers a request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Overall/Read Permission:** Attackers require Overall/Read permission in Jenkins to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** Attackers need the ability to craft malicious HTTP requests.
* **Ability to host malicious webpage:**  For CSRF exploitation, attackers need a way to make the victim's browser send the malicious request to the Jenkins server.

**Affected Plugin:**
`miniorange-saml-sp`

**Affected Versions:**
2.0.2 and earlier

**Fix:**
Update to version 2.1.0, which requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.
