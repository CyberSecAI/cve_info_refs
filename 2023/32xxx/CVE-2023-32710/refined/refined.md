- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `copyresults` SPL command which allows a low-privileged user to transfer data from a search job if they know the search ID (SID).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to insufficient access control on the `copyresults` command.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A low-privileged user can gain unauthorized access to data from another user's search results.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must be a low-privileged user and needs to know the search ID (SID) of a recently run search job. The attacker also needs to initiate a copyresults command in order to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a low-privileged user within the Splunk environment and needs to know the SID of a search that has run recently. The user must also be able to interact with the Splunk search interface to issue the `copyresults` command.
