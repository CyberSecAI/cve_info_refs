CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code when you use Validation Placeholders. The vulnerability exists in the Validation library, and validation methods in the controller and in-model validation are also vulnerable because they use the Validation library internally. This issue is patched in version 4.3.5.
