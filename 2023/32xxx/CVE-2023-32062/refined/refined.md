Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-32062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient security checks in the OroCalendarBundle when accessing system calendar events. Specifically, back-office users could bypass ACL (Access Control List) security restrictions and access information from any system calendar event.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate ACL Enforcement:** The core weakness is the failure to properly enforce ACLs when accessing system calendar events. This allows unauthorized users to view event details they should not have access to.
*   **Bypass of Security Restrictions:** The vulnerability enables a bypass of intended security restrictions, which are designed to limit access based on user roles and permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact of successful exploitation is the unauthorized disclosure of system calendar event information. This could expose sensitive details about scheduled activities, appointments, or other confidential information stored in the calendar.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The unauthorized access leads to a breach of confidentiality, as users gain access to data that should be protected by ACLs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access:** The attack vector involves direct access to system calendar events, bypassing the intended access control mechanisms. This means a user could potentially access the event via a direct link, even if they lack the appropriate permissions through the user interface.
*   **Network:**  The CVSS vector indicates a network attack vector (AV:N), meaning an attacker can be remote.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Back-office User:** The attacker needs to be a back-office user with a valid account.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs only low privileges (PR:L) to exploit the vulnerability, indicating that a standard user could potentially exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack requires no user interaction (UI:N).
*   **Access to System:** The attacker must have access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects versions of `oro/calendar-bundle`:
    *   >=4.2.0, <=4.2.6
    *   >=5.0.0, <=5.0.6
    *   >=5.1.0, <5.1.1
*  **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in versions 5.1.1 and 5.0.7 of `oro/calendar-bundle`.
*   **CVSS Score:** The CVSS v3 score is 5.0, which is considered a moderate severity level.
*   **Scope Changed:** The scope is changed (S:C), which means that the vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope of the vulnerable component, this often means a vulnerability in one component can compromise other components.
* **Fix:** The provided commits show changes to the SystemCalendarEventController.php to add additional permission checks. The Behat tests added verify the fix by ensuring a user without proper permissions cannot access a calendar event via a direct link and should receive a 403 error.

In summary, CVE-2023-32062 describes a moderate severity vulnerability that allows unauthorized back-office users to access system calendar event information due to missing ACL checks.
