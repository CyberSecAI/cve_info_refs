- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, which allows an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can perform actions they are not intended to, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification, or other unintended consequences. Specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any user with a "Subscriber" role, meaning it's likely reachable via the frontend/public facing site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be logged in as a subscriber to exploit the vulnerability.
