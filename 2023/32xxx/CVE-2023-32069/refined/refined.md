Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of included content within XWiki class sheets. Specifically, when a user includes a document (like a class sheet) in their user profile, the included content is executed with the rights of the *user profile* rather than the rights of the *author of the included document (class sheet)*. This allows an attacker with a regular account to execute code with elevated privileges via the class sheet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Privilege Context:** The core issue is that included content is not executed within the security context of its author. This leads to a privilege escalation vulnerability.
*   **Unrestricted Macro Execution:** The Groovy macro, which allows arbitrary code execution, was being executed without proper authorization checks in the context of the user profile.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can execute arbitrary code with the rights of the class sheet's author (which could be an administrator), allowing them to potentially perform administrative actions, modify data, or achieve remote code execution on the server.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Through the use of the Groovy macro, an attacker can execute code on the server, potentially compromising the entire system.
*   **Impersonation:** An attacker can potentially impersonate another user by executing code with their rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **User Profile Modification:** The attacker needs to modify their user profile. This involves two steps:
    *   Adding a `DocumentSheetBinding` object of type `Default Class Sheet`.
    *   Injecting malicious code (e.g., a Groovy macro) into the profile using the wiki editor.
2.  **Code Execution:** Once the user profile is saved and viewed, the injected code is executed with elevated privileges, leading to the intended malicious actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Attacker Account:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the XWiki instance.
*   **Object and Wiki Editor Access:** The attacker needs access to modify their user profile via the object editor and wiki editor interfaces.
*  **No User Interaction:** The attacker only needs to save and view their own profile for the code to be executed. No interaction from another user is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as being present in versions prior to 15.0-rc-1 and 14.10.4.
*   The fix involves ensuring that included content is executed with the rights of its author, preventing the privilege escalation.
*   The vulnerability is classified as critical with a CVSS v3 base score of 10.0.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **Attack Vector (AV):** Network
*   **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low
*   **Privileges Required (PR):** Low
*  **User Interaction (UI):** None
*   **Scope (S):** Changed
*   **Confidentiality (C):** High
*   **Integrity (I):** High
*   **Availability (A):** High
*   **CWE:** CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)

This vulnerability allows a malicious user to gain full control of the XWiki server.
