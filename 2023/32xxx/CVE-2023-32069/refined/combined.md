#### Description

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Edit your user profile with the object editor and add an object of type DocumentSheetBinding with value Default Class Sheet
2. Edit your user profile with the wiki editor and add the syntax
   ```
   {{async}}{{groovy}}println("Hello " + "from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}
   ```
3. Click "Save & View"

**Expected result:**

An error is displayed as the user doesn't have the right to execute the Groovy macro.

**Actual result:**

The text "Hello from groovy!" is displayed at the top of the document.

It cannot be reproduced in 15.\* thanks to [~~XWIKI-5027~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-5027 "In Syntax xwiki/2.x, programming rights may be inherited by inclusion which may leads to security issues"), but we need to add an explicit indication that the included content should be executed with the right of its author in 14.10.x.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
