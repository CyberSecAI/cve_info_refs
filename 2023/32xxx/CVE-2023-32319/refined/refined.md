  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Missing brute-force protection on the WebDAV endpoints via the basic auth header.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-307"
    ],
    "impact": "Allows attackers to brute-force user credentials when the provided user name was not an email address, potentially leading to unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based attacks targeting WebDAV endpoints.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send multiple requests to the vulnerable WebDAV endpoints. They need to know or guess valid usernames that are not email addresses.",
    "details": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of brute-force protection on WebDAV endpoints when using basic authentication. If the username provided is not an email address, it is possible to try multiple authentication attempts without being blocked. The fix involves limiting login attempts, specifically via basic auth headers on WebDAV requests."
