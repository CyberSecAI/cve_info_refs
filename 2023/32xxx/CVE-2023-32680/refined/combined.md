# Native models enable people without SQL permissions to create and edit SQL snippets

Moderate

[nemanjaglumac](/nemanjaglumac)
published
GHSA-mw6j-f894-4qxv
May 18, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<x.46.3, <x.45.4, <x.44.7

## Patched versions

0.46.3, 1.46.3, 0.45.4, 1.45.4, 0.44.7, 1.44.7

## Description

## Impact

To edit SQL Snippets, Metabase should have required people to be in at least one group with native query editing permissions to a database–but Metabase didn't enforce that requirement.

This lack of enforcement meant that:

* Anyone–including people in sandboxed groups–could edit SQL snippets. They could edit snippets via the API or, in the application UI, when editing the metadata for a model based on a SQL question.
* People in sandboxed groups could edit a SQL snippet used in a query that creates their sandbox. If the snippet contained logic that restricted which data that person could see, they could potentially edit that snippet and change their level of data access.

### Patches

The permissions model for SQL snippets has been fixed in Metabase versions 46.3, 45.4, and 44.7.

### Workarounds

For the sandboxing issue, workarounds include:

* Ensuring that SQL queries used to create sandboxes exclude SQL snippets.
* In Metabase Enterprise Edition, using SQL snippet folders to restrict access to SQL snippets.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
