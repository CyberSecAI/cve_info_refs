Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-32305

**Description:**

The vulnerability is present in the `aiven-extras` extension for PostgreSQL, which is incorporated into multiple NetApp products. Versions of this extension prior to 1.1.9 are susceptible to a privilege escalation vulnerability due to missing schema qualifiers on privileged functions.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of explicit `pg_catalog` schema qualification for array and string function calls (e.g., `array_length`, `format`, and `left`) within the security definer functions of the `aiven-extras` PostgreSQL extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing schema qualifiers on function calls within security definer functions.
- This allows a low privileged database user to create functions that have the same names as existing functions in the extension.
- When the extension's function is called, the user-defined function is executed instead.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can escalate to `superuser` privileges within the PostgreSQL database.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Data Manipulation:**  Addition or modification of data by an attacker.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can cause a Denial of Service condition.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability may allow for arbitrary code execution on the underlying host as the `postgres` user due to the elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through manipulation of the PostgreSQL database environment.
- A low-privileged user creates objects within the database which collide with function names used by the extension.
- The vulnerable functions within the extension are executed which triggers the malicious user-defined functions instead.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker requires a low privileged account on the affected PostgreSQL database instance which incorporates a vulnerable version of the `aiven-extras` extension.

**Additional notes:**
- NetApp is aware of public discussion of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability shares a root cause with CVE-2018-1058, and the provided write-up of that vulnerability is considered a sufficient technical description for this one.
- The vulnerability is rated as HIGH with a CVSS score of 8.8
- NetApp states that no products are currently known to be affected.

This is a privilege escalation vulnerability, allowing a low privileged user to execute arbitrary code as the postgres user.
