        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `LeaseTimeToLive` API did not enforce RBAC permissions when retrieving key names associated with a lease.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `LeaseTimeToLive` API, when the `Keys` parameter is true, returned key names associated with a lease even when the user did not have read permissions for those keys, violating RBAC.",
         "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who does not have read permissions to specific keys can still obtain the names of these keys if they are associated with a lease, by calling the `LeaseTimeToLive` API with the `Keys` parameter set to true. This information leak is limited to key names and not their values. The impact is limited to clusters with auth enabled.",
        "Attack vectors": "An attacker can use the `LeaseTimeToLive` API with `Keys` parameter set to true to leak key names associated with leases.",
         "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have access to the etcd API and be able to call `LeaseTimeToLive`, and the etcd cluster must have authentication and RBAC enabled. The attacker does not need read permission to specific keys to retrieve their names if they are associated with a lease."

      "Response": {
         "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `LeaseTimeToLive` API was not performing proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to key names associated with leases.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `LeaseTimeToLive` API did not enforce RBAC permissions, leaking key names when `Keys` parameter was set to true even without necessary read permissions for those keys. The impact is limited to clusters with authentication (RBAC) enabled.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could gain knowledge of key names associated with leases by using the `LeaseTimeToLive` API, even without having the required read permissions for those keys, leading to an information leak. However, the values of the keys are not accessible through this API.",
         "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit the `LeaseTimeToLive` API with the `Keys` parameter set to true to obtain key names for leases they do not have permissions to access otherwise.",
