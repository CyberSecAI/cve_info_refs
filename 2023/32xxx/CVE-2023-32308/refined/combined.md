# SQL Injection Vulnerability in invoices.php

Moderate

[anuko](/anuko)
published
GHSA-9g2c-7c7g-p58r
May 15, 2023

## Package

invoices.php

## Affected versions

< 1.22.11.5781

## Patched versions

1.22.11.5781

## Description

### Impact

Boolean-based blind SQL injection vulnerability existed in Time Tracker invoices.php in versions prior to 1.22.11.5781. This was happening because of a coding error after validating parameters in POST requests. There was no check for errors before adjusting invoice sorting order. Because of this, it was possible to craft a POST request with malicious SQL for Time Tracker database.

### Patches

Fixed in version 1.22.11.5781.

### Workarounds

Upgrade is recommended. If it is not practical, insert an additional check for errors (line 79) in a condition before calling `ttGroupHelper::getActiveInvoices()` (line 85) in invoices.php.

### References

More invormation about this issue is available on Anuko website at <https://www.anuko.com/time-tracker/news/sql-injection-vulnerability-in-invoices.htm>

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-32308

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
