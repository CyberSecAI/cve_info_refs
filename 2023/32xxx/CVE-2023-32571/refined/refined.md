The provided content is a GitHub page for the `System.Linq.Dynamic.Core` library. This library allows writing dynamic LINQ queries using strings. It mentions a breaking change in version 1.3.0 related to calling methods on classes, introducing a security measure. The library now only allows method calls on standard predefined classes unless custom classes are annotated with the `[DynamicLinqType]` attribute or a custom `CustomTypeProvider` is implemented.

Here's a breakdown relevant to security:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The breaking change in v1.3.0 was introduced "due to security reasons." This implies that prior versions of the library had an issue that could be exploited through method calls on arbitrary classes. This suggests a potential for arbitrary code execution or information disclosure if an attacker could control the string used for the dynamic LINQ query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted Method Invocation (Prior to v1.3.0):** Older versions of the library allowed method calls on arbitrary classes without any checks or restrictions when using dynamic queries.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation (Implicit):**  The library, by design, allows string-based input for queries. Without proper sanitization or validation, this could be exploited if an attacker provides malicious string input that is then parsed and executed by the library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious dynamic LINQ query string, an attacker could potentially invoke methods leading to arbitrary code execution on the server/application where the library is used.
- **Information Disclosure:** Exploitation could lead to an attacker gaining access to sensitive information by crafting a query that retrieves such data through method calls.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious queries could be crafted to consume excessive resources and potentially crash or cause a DoS condition on the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Query String:** The primary attack vector is through the dynamic query string input that is passed to the `Where`, `OrderBy`, `Select`, or similar dynamic LINQ functions. This string could be controlled or manipulated by an attacker depending on the application's design and data flow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control over Input:** The attacker needs to have some form of control or influence over the string input provided to the dynamic LINQ functions in the application where `System.Linq.Dynamic.Core` is used. This could be a user-provided query string, a field in a database, etc.
- **Knowledge of Target System:**  A successful attack might require some knowledge of the target application's data model and custom classes, to construct effective malicious method calls.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content highlights that the vulnerability was addressed by limiting method calls on non-standard types starting from v1.3.0. It also mentions solutions if a custom type is needed by using `[DynamicLinqType]` or a `CustomTypeProvider`.
- This information suggests that any usage of `System.Linq.Dynamic.Core` prior to version 1.3.0 should be treated as having a potential security vulnerability, and an upgrade is needed to mitigate the risk.
