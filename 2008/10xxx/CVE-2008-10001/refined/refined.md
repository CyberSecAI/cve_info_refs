Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to an input validation error in the login script (/login.jsp) of Pro2col StingRay FTS, where user-supplied input for the username field is not properly sanitized before being displayed in the /verify_login.jsp page.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the username field which leads to reflected XSS when the input is displayed on the /verify_login.jsp page after failed login attempt.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary script code execution within the user's browser session. This could enable attackers to gain elevated privileges, such as extracting sensitive cookie information or launching further attacks against the userâ€™s browser. The vulnerability is considered serious because it affects non-authenticated parts of the software.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is via a specially crafted username input in the login form. An attacker can inject JavaScript code into the username field. This injected script will be reflected and executed in the user's browser when the login attempt fails, and the error message on /verify_login.jsp page is displayed.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the Pro2col StingRay FTS application and provide input to the username field. No authentication is required to access the vulnerable login page.
