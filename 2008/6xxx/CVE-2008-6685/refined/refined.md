**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of exploitation varies depending on the vulnerability:

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **SQL Injection:** Allows an attacker to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **External Setting Manipulation:** Allows manipulation of external settings of the website, with impact depending on the functionality of the affected settings

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors are generally through:
*   Web requests that are not sanitized properly, leading to the vulnerabilities being triggered.
* Specific attack vectors would depend on the specific code for each extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web application interface or make requests to it.
* The specific knowledge of the vulnerable extension's functions are required to exploit the vulnerabilities.

The bulletin also provides solutions for each vulnerability. For most extensions, this means upgrading to a newer version. For some, the extensions are no longer maintained and should be uninstalled.
