```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not properly sanitize the filename parameter, allowing directory traversal. Specifically, the code uses the filename parameter from the GET or POST request to construct a file path without proper validation.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Directory traversal vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize the `filename` parameter, allowing an attacker to include `../` sequences to access files outside of the intended directory. It also allows for null byte injection which effectively truncates the file path after the attacker's injected path.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive files such as configuration files containing database credentials or admin passwords. In this case, the exploit retrieves the config.php which contains the admin password.
- Attack vectors: HTTP GET requests to the index.php script, manipulating the filename parameter to include directory traversal sequences.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable web application. Magic quotes must be off for null byte injection to work.
