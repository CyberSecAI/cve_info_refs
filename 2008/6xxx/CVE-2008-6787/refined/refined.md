- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in the login functionality of Lizardware CMS. It stems from the insecure handling of user input in the `user` parameter when authenticating to the administrator panel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, specifically the user passwords from the `users` table. In this case, the exploit targets the `user_password` field of a specified `user_id`.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the login form of the administrator panel. The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query, injecting it into the username field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application. They also need to have knowledge of a valid user ID in the system and the table prefix.

The provided Perl script demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability using a time-based blind SQL injection. The script iterates through the characters of the password using the `ascii(substring(...))` SQL function and uses a `benchmark` function to introduce a time delay if a character matches the current guess.
