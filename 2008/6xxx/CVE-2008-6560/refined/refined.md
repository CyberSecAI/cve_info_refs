Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6560:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `cman` (Cluster Manager) configuration loader. A static array with a limited size (52 entries) was used to store data during configuration loading. By providing a malformed configuration file with excessive data, an attacker could overflow this buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the use of a fixed-size buffer to hold configuration data. This allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated memory space by providing a large enough configuration.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `cman` configuration loader does not adequately validate the size and structure of the configuration file it is processing. This allows an attacker to provide a malformed file and trigger the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploiting the vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition. Specifically, the `cman` process may consume excessive CPU resources and exhibit memory corruption. The system would hang in libxml operations due to the large amounts of data it attempts to parse.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The buffer overflow causes memory corruption, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and instability of the system. Although the bug report states it is not exploitable for code execution it can still cause a crash or DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Configuration File:** The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted cluster configuration file (`cluster.conf`) containing an excessive number of entries within the `<cman>` block or other affected sections..

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Modify Cluster Configuration:** An attacker needs the ability to modify the cluster configuration file (`cluster.conf`). This could be achieved by directly modifying the file on disk, or through automated tools that can interact with the config file. The file is typically owned by root, but if a sysadmin changes permissions to a less restrictive ownership, then an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by compromising an account with cluster admin access.
*   **No specific network access is necessary:** The vulnerability is triggered by the cman service reading the configuration file, therefore it can be triggered without any network based exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported as a potential security issue but was later categorized as a bug fix since `cluster.conf` is normally admin controlled.
*   The vulnerability is present in Red Hat Cluster Suite's `cman` component.
*   The vulnerability does not cross privilege boundaries in realistic uses of the product.
*   The fix involved addressing the buffer overflow issue in the `cman` configuration loader.
*   The fix was implemented in cluster.git, and backported to RHEL5.
*   The issue was resolved in `cman-2.0.100-1.el5`.

The provided information provides more details than the official CVE description, which just states:
> It was discovered that CMAN did not properly handle malformed configuration files. An attacker could cause a denial of service (via CPU consumption and memory corruption) in a node if the attacker were able to modify the cluster configuration for the node.
