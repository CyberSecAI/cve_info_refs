Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is two-fold:
    *   **Input validation vulnerabilities** within the web management interface of Avaya SES.
    *   **Unauthorized access** allowed to certain files through the web management interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Input validation flaws:** The web interface does not properly sanitize user input, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.
*   **Unauthorized file access:**  The web interface allows access to files that should be protected, without requiring proper authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting the input validation vulnerabilities.
*   **Information disclosure:** An attacker can view sensitive files without authentication due to the unauthorized access vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerabilities are exploitable via the web management interface of Avaya SES.
*   The specific attack vectors are not detailed in this advisory, but the vulnerability descriptions suggest:
     * Malicious input to the web interface for arbitrary code execution.
     * Direct access to protected files via the web interface for unauthorized access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs network access to the web management interface of Avaya SES.
* For the arbitrary code execution flaw, an attacker needs the ability to send specifically crafted input to the web interface. For the unauthorized file access, an attacker would need to send requests to the web interface to access these files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory explicitly mentions that SES 5.0 and later are not vulnerable to these issues.
*   The advisory recommends restricting local and network access to vulnerable systems via physical security, firewalls, ACLs, and VPNs.

This advisory provides more detail than the standard CVE description, specifying two distinct vulnerabilities and their impacts. It also gives affected versions and remediation steps.
