```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user input used in the SQL query within `admin/usercheck.php` and `add.php`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authentication and potentially gain administrative access by injecting SQL code into the username and password fields. Additionally, they can upload malicious files and execute them via the file upload vulnerability in `add.php`.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The attacker can manipulate the login form by supplying SQL injection payloads such as `' or '1=1` in the username and password fields.",
    "The attacker can exploit the file upload vulnerability in `add.php`."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to access the login form of the FlexPHPDirectory application. For the file upload, they must be able to access the `add.php` endpoint."
