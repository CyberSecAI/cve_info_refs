Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6464:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `event.php` script of the Basic PHP Events Lister 1.0 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query. Specifically, the `id` parameter in `event.php` is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database. In the provided example, the attacker retrieves the username and password from the `admin` table.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability can lead to other attacks, such as modifying or deleting data, or even gaining complete control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes SQL injection code in the `id` parameter within a GET request to the `event.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific user privileges are required. The attacker can be remote (i.e. no local access required)

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit example URL is: `http://host/event.php?id=-0x90+union+select+0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,concat(uname,0x3a,pword),0x90+from+admin--`
- This URL exploits the SQL injection vulnerability by using a `UNION SELECT` statement to append a malicious query to the original query, thereby extracting the username and password from the `admin` table. `0x3a` is the hex for ":" and is used as a seperator of uname and pword in the concatenated string.
- The `-0x90` is a way to return no results from the original query.

**Summary:**
The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Basic PHP Events Lister 1.0 application. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through a crafted HTTP GET request to extract sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.
