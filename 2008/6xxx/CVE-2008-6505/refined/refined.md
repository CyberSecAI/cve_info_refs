Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2008-6505:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Struts 2 dispatcher logic allows serving static resources from the web application's classpath for URIs starting with "/struts/". The `FilterDispatcher` (in Struts 2.0) and `DefaultStaticContentLoader` (in Struts 2.1) did not properly sanitize or normalize the requested path before serving static content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows attackers to use double-encoded URLs and relative path sequences (e.g., `..%252f`) in requests to traverse directory structures and access files outside the intended static content folder.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized File Access:** Attackers can potentially read server file system resources including sensitive configuration files, class files and source code of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can send specially crafted HTTP requests with manipulated URLs to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication or special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Struts 2 versions 2.0.0 through 2.0.11.2 and 2.1.0 through 2.1.2
- The issue is resolved in Struts 2.0.12 and 2.1.6 and later.
- The vulnerability is not guaranteed to be exploitable on all container types but the Struts2 dispatcher needs to prevent access regardless of the container.
- The example URLs provided in the content show how to exploit the vulnerability using double encoded path traversal sequences such as `/struts/..%252f` and `/struts/..%252f..%252f..%252fWEB-INF/classess/example/Login.class/`
