```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into an SQL query. Specifically, the `id` parameter from the GET request is used to construct the SQL query within the `visita` function in `scripts/links.php`.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Blind SQL Injection. The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `id` parameter.

- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could extract sensitive data, modify data, or potentially gain further control of the server hosting the application by exploiting the blind SQL injection.

- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable script `/scripts/links.php` with the `s` parameter set to `links` and the `id` parameter manipulated with malicious SQL code.

- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required.
