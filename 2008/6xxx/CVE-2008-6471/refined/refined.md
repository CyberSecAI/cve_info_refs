Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6471:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from exploit-db.com explicitly mentions "CVE: 2008-6471" and describes a SQL injection vulnerability in "easyLink 1.1.0". This directly relates to the CVE ID. The secunia.com content does not mention the CVE ID, but its vulnerability research team may be responsible for its discovery.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `detail.php` script. Specifically, the `cat` parameter is vulnerable.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database, such as user credentials (usernames and passwords).
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially, an attacker could use the injected SQL to escalate privileges within the application.
- **Complete Compromise:** Depending on database configuration, complete server compromise may be possible.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP request to `detail.php`, manipulating the `cat` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious query.
- **Publicly Accessible:** The vulnerable component, `detail.php`, needs to be publicly accessible.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit example provided uses `union select` to extract the `user` and `passwort` (likely password) fields from the `elink_user` table. The `concat_ws` function is used to combine these fields for easier retrieval.

```
http://localhost/links/detail.php?act=show&cat=1+union+select+1,2,concat_ws(0x3a,user,passwort),4,5+from+elink_user
```

This exploit shows how an attacker can retrieve user credentials. The `+` symbols represent URL encoding for spaces, and `0x3a` represents a colon.

**Summary of Findings:**

This CVE describes a SQL injection vulnerability within the `detail.php` of easyLink 1.1.0. This vulnerability can be exploited via a malformed HTTP request that does not properly sanitize the `cat` parameter. Successful exploitation can lead to full data breaches and could allow for complete server compromise.
