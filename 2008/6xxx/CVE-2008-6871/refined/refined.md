{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper authentication mechanisms and exposes sensitive files directly via web URLs.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Authentication Bypass",
    "Directory Traversal (Direct File Access)",
    "Information Disclosure"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authentication to access administrative functionalities and directly access the database file containing sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "Direct HTTP requests to vulnerable URLs.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No special capabilities or positioning is required. An attacker needs to know the vulnerable URLs."
