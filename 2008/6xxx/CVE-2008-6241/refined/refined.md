Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6241:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `admin/usercheck.php` file of Flexphpsite version 0.0.1.
- The SQL query used for authentication is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$checkuser` and `$checkpass`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism by injecting malicious SQL code into the username and/or password fields, gaining unauthorized access to the administrative panel.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the login form of the administrative interface (`/admin/index.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the login form.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable SQL query is:
  ```sql
  $sql = "select username,adminid from linkexadmin where username='$checkuser' and password='$checkpass'";
  ```
- The exploit uses the SQL injection payload `' or '1=1` in both the username and password fields to bypass the authentication. The resulting query will evaluate to true for any user.

```sql
select username,adminid from linkexadmin where username='' or '1=1' and password='' or '1=1';
```
- This bypasses the password check because `'1=1'` will always evaluate to true.
