The provided content is related to CVE-2008-6475.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `HTTP_VIA` header. The `GetIP()` function in `/classes/user.php` uses the value of the `HTTP_VIA` header without sanitization, which is later used in an SQL query in `/components/guestbook/guestbook.php`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `HTTP_VIA` header.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials.
- In the provided exploit code, the attacker can extract the admin username and password hashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/index.php?option=guestbook` with the malicious SQL code injected into the `Via` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
