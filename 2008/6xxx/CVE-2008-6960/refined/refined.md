  "cve": "CVE-2008-6960",
  "description": "X10media Mp3 Search Engine 1.6 has a remote file disclosure vulnerability in the download.php script. By encoding the URL of a local file and passing it as the 'url' parameter, an attacker can download any file on the server.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `download.php` script does not properly sanitize the 'url' parameter, which is used to specify the file to download. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path, including sensitive files such as `includes/constants.php` which contains database login credentials.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files and database credentials, leading to full compromise of the application and potentially the server.",
     "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is exposed through the `download.php` script via an HTTP GET request.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted GET request to the vulnerable server with a properly encoded file path in the 'url' parameter."
