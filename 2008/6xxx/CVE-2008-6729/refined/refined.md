Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6729

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of CSRF protection in PHPmotion version 2.1. The application does not properly validate the origin of requests that modify user data, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is a CSRF issue that allows an attacker to change a user's password and email address without their explicit consent or knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Takeover:** By exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker can change a victim's password and email address, effectively taking over their account.
*   **Data Modification:** The attacker gains the ability to modify a user's email address in addition to their password.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Social Engineering:** The attack relies on social engineering to lure the victim to a malicious web page controlled by the attacker.
*   **Hidden Iframe:** The attacker embeds a hidden iframe on their malicious page that, when loaded by the victim's browser, sends a forged request to the vulnerable PHPmotion application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to create a malicious webpage.
*   The attacker must successfully convince a logged-in user of PHPmotion to visit the webpage.
*   The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTML and javascript to create and submit the form.
*   The attacker must know the vulnerable application's URL.
