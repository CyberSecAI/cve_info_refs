**Vulnerability:** Multiple Local File Inclusion Vulnerabilities in Zen Cart 1.3.8

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from local file inclusion issues.

**Weaknesses:**
- The application is vulnerable to local file inclusion.
- The vulnerability requires `register_globals` to be enabled.
- The server must not correctly process or must ignore .htaccess files.

**Impact:** An attacker could potentially include and execute arbitrary files from the local system, potentially leading to:
    - Arbitrary code execution
    - Information disclosure
    - Modification of application data

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the local file inclusion vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to exploit the local file inclusion vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to target a system where `register_globals` is enabled.
- The targeted web server must not process .htaccess files or ignore them.

**Additional Notes:**
- A .htaccess file in `admin/includes` is designed to prevent remote access to PHP files within that directory. This mitigates the remote exploitation of the vulnerability by denying requests to those files, unless the request comes from localhost.
- The .htaccess file blocks direct HTTP requests to PHP files in the admin/includes directory, however, it does not prevent PHP include/require functions.
- The advisory notes that the vulnerability requires `register_globals` to be enabled, which is a deprecated PHP setting.
- The vulnerability is also mentioned in relation to milw0rm 6038 and BID 30179.
