Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-6606:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `view.php` script of MatPo Link version 1.2b. Specifically, the `id` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter in the `view.php` file. This allows the attacker to manipulate database queries and potentially extract sensitive data, modify data, or even gain control over the database server. Both regular and blind SQLi are present.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is also vulnerable to XSS through the `thema` parameter in `view.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other private data.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data stored in the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers could use SQL injection to gain elevated privileges within the database server.
*   **XSS:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could steal user session cookies, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users.
    *   **Malicious Script Execution:** Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript code that can be executed in the victim's browser, redirecting them to phishing sites or performing other malicious actions.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could alter the content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector for both vulnerabilities is through HTTP GET requests.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL targeting the `view.php` script, including SQL injection code in the `id` parameter.
*   **XSS:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL targeting the `view.php` script, including JavaScript code in the `thema` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   No authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or local access to the server.

**Additional Details:**

* The exploit examples provided in the content demonstrate both regular SQL injection using `UNION SELECT` and blind SQL injection, using `AND` and `substring`.
* The content also shows an example of how to inject XSS using the `thema` parameter, using a basic JavaScript payload.
* The vulnerable application is MatPo Link 1.2b and is written in PHP.
* The exploits were published on 2008-11-03.
