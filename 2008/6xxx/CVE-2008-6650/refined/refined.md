```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `del.php` script where the `post_id` parameter from the GET request is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or validation. The `confirm` parameter being equal to "yes" is also used directly.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability because user-supplied input from the `post_id` and `confirm` parameters is directly included in the SQL DELETE query.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can delete arbitrary posts from the blog by manipulating the `post_id` parameter. This leads to data loss and disruption of the blog's content.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `del.php` script with a manipulated `post_id` and a `confirm=yes`.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
