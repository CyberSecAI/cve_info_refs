- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The extensions `pmk_rssnewsexport` and `cm_rdfexport` fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input processed by the vulnerable extensions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to be able to send malicious input to the vulnerable extensions, typically through HTTP requests.
