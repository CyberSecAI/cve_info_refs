Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the login.php page of Simple Customer 1.2 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the password field, allowing for SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - Authentication bypass: An attacker can bypass the login authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
  -  The attacker interacts with the login page via a web browser
  - The attacker enters a specially crafted SQL injection payload in the password field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the application (network access).
  - Basic understanding of SQL injection is required

**Technical Details:**
  - The exploit uses `' or '1=1` as the password to bypass authentication, which is a common SQL injection technique to create a condition that always evaluates to true, thus bypassing the password check.
  -  Any email address in email format can be used in the email field, which suggests the email field might not be directly vulnerable to SQL injection in this specific case, but it is still part of the authentication bypass process.
