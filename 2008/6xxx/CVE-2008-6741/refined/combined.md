# Board Description		     #								  #
#====================================#								  #
#												  #
# Simple Machines Forum - SMF in short - is a free, professional grade software package that 	  #
# allows you to set up your own online community within minutes.				  #
# Its powerful custom made template engine puts you in full control of the lay-out of your	  #
# message board and with our unique SSI - or Server Side Includes - function you can let your     #
# forum and your website interact with each other.						  #
# SMF is written in the popular language PHP and uses a MySQL database. It is designed to provide #
# you with all the features you need from a bulletin board while having an absolute minimal	  #
# impact on the resources of the server. 							  #
# SMF is the next generation of forum software - and best of all it is and will always 		  #
# remain completely free! 									  #
#												  #

# Proof Of Concept / Bug Explanation #                                                            #
#====================================#                                                            #
# This is a quite old exploit and it is inapplicable on 1.1.5 version and on last 2.0 pre-release #
# (that's why I decided to public it). First, let's have a little poc.				  #
#=================================================================================================#

[Load.php]

148.	if (isset($db_character_set) && preg_match('~^\w+$~', $db_character_set) === 1)
149.		db_query("
150.			SET NAMES $db_character_set", __FILE__, __LINE__);

#=================================================================================================#
# In Load.php if $db_character_set is set Smf will execute a Set Names Sql Query.      		  #
# Directly from dev.mysql.com let's see what it means.						  #
#												  #
# "SET NAMES indicates what character set the client will use to send SQL statements to the       #
# the server. Thus, SET NAMES 'cp1251' tells the server future incoming messages from this client #
# are in character set cp1251."									  #
#												  #
# Ok, now let's see what $db_character_set is.							  #
# $db_character_set is a "Settings.php variable" written only if a "Non-Default tick"	          #
# is checked during the installation process.							  #
# The real vulnerability is when the "Non-Default tick" is left unchecked, Smf doesn't write      #
# it in "Settings.php" and no value is assigned to it: it's possible to set it 			  #
# via register_globals.										  #
# 												  #
# Now the cool poc section =D 									  #
# Surely you saw that preg_match avoids any injection of non-alphanumerical chars in the query    #
# at line 150 in Load.php 	  								  #
# So, how is possible to take advantage of that?						  #
# To understand this vulnerability you have to comprehend some character set presents multibyte	  #
# characters and they may obiate addslashes() function.		  	  			  #
# Addslashes simply adds a backslash (0x5c) before single quote ('), double quote ("), 		  #
# backslash (\) and NUL (the NULL byte), without checking if the added blackslash creates 	  #
# another char.											  #
# No, i'm not going mad :P Here is an example:							  #
#												  #
# 	   				    Bytes in Input 					  #
#	      				        0xa327						  #
#												  #
#      				       Addslashes(Bytes in Input)				  #
#    	     				       0xa35c27						  #
# 												  #
# In big5, but also in other multibyte charsets, 0xa35c is a valid char: 0x27 (') is left alone.  #
# Therefore a lot of smf's queries are vulnerable if $db_character_set is settable.		  #
# In this exploit i will inject sql code in Update syntax, increasing user's privledges.	  #

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
