```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of the 'tag' parameter in the 'all.php' script.
    - SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the 'plugins/users/index.php' script due to insufficient input validation of the 'id' parameter.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - SQL Injection

- Impact of exploitation:
    - XSS: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that can be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
    - SQL Injection: An attacker can manipulate SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords, or potentially modify or delete data.

- Attack vectors:
    - XSS: By crafting a malicious URL containing the JavaScript payload in the 'tag' parameter of the 'all.php' file and tricking a user into accessing it.
    - SQL Injection: By manipulating the 'id' parameter in the 'plugins/users/index.php' script with SQL injection syntax.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - For both vulnerabilities, the attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs. For XSS, the attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the crafted URL. For SQL injection, the attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.
