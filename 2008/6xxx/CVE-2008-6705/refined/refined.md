  "CVE-2008-6705": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2008-6705",
      "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl versions 1.0006 and earlier. These include a stack-based buffer overflow in IPureServer::_Recieve, an integer overflow in NET_Compressor::Decompress, and an INT3 instruction vulnerability in MultipacketReciever::RecievePacket. Remote attackers can exploit these to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code on the server. The attacker needs to join the server for exploiting the above vulnerabilities, but although it supports the banning of the IP addresses is possible to spoof the packets and bypassing this limitation due to the lack of handshakes in the protocol of the game.",

    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "IPureServer::_Recieve Buffer Overflow": {
        "Root Cause": "The `_Recieve` function copies data from an incoming packet into an 8 KB stack buffer using `memcpy`. The size of the copy is determined by a 16-bit value in the packet, allowing for sizes exceeding the buffer.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Stack-based buffer overflow",
          "Insufficient bounds checking"
        ],
        "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the server",
        "Attack Vector": "Sending a crafted UDP packet with a size value exceeding the 8KB stack buffer." ,
         "Required Capabilities": "Ability to join the game server and send specially crafted packets"
      },
      "NET_Compressor::Decompress Integer Overflow": {
        "Root Cause": "The `NET_Compressor::Decompress` function attempts to decompress data. If the data is not compressed, it calculates the size to copy by subtracting 1 from the current data size and performs a `memcpy` operation. Sending a packet without any data results in a copy of -1 bytes (interpreted as a very large unsigned number) leading to a crash.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Integer overflow",
          "Insufficient input validation"
        ],
        "Impact": "Denial of service (crash) of the server",
        "Attack Vector": "Sending a UDP packet with a specific byte set to 0xc1 and no data payload.",
        "Required Capabilities": "Ability to join the game server and send specially crafted packets"
      },
      "MultipacketReciever::RecievePacket INT3": {
        "Root Cause": "The `MultipacketReciever::RecievePacket` function checks if a byte in the incoming packet is equal to 0xe0 or 0xe1. If the byte is neither of those values, an `INT3` instruction is executed, immediately terminating the server.",
         "Weaknesses": [
          "Lack of proper input validation",
          "Unconditional exception"
        ],
        "Impact": "Denial of service (immediate server termination)",
        "Attack Vector": "Sending a UDP packet where the first byte is not 0xe0 or 0xe1.",
        "Required Capabilities": "Ability to join the game server and send specially crafted packets"
      }
    }
