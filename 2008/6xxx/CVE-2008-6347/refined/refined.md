- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `onguma.class.php` file of the `com_ongumatimesheet20` component. The file includes other PHP files using a variable `mosConfig_absolute_path` which is not properly sanitized and can be controlled by an attacker via a GET parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter is directly used in `include_once` statements without validation allowing the inclusion of arbitrary remote files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include a malicious PHP file from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the vulnerable Joomla component. This could lead to complete compromise of the system including data theft or manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `onguma.class.php` file. The attacker controls the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a server hosting a malicious PHP file.
