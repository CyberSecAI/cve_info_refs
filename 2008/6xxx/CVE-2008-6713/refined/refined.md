Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by a NULL pointer dereference within the World in Conflict (WIC) server application. This occurs when the server receives a data block of zero bytes through the main TCP game port (default 48000).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that the server fails to properly handle a zero-byte data packet, leading to a dereference of a NULL pointer, which causes the server to crash.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The server lacks proper input validation or handling for unexpected data sizes, such as zero-byte packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a crash of the WIC server, leading to a denial of service. This prevents legitimate users from playing the game.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The attack is performed remotely via the network by sending a crafted zero-byte data packet to the server's game port.
*   **Network Protocol:** The vulnerability is triggered via the main TCP game port of the server (default 48000).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the WIC server via the network.
*   **Packet Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be capable of sending a zero-byte data packet to the server.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided content from aluigi.altervista.org gives specific technical details about the vulnerability, including a proof-of-concept (PoC) script.
*   The vulnerability affects World in Conflict versions 1.009 and earlier.
