Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6917

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the authentication mechanism of ExoPHPDesk v1.2 Final. This allows an attacker to bypass the login process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user input when processing login credentials. Specifically, the username field is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Authentication Bypass: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel of the application.
- Full administrative access:  With access to the admin panel, an attacker may be able to further compromise the application and potentially the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  HTTP Request: The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted login request to the admin panel login form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- Basic SQL Knowledge:  A basic understanding of SQL syntax is needed to craft the exploit.
- No prior access: The vulnerability can be exploited without valid credentials, allowing complete bypass.

**Technical Details**
The exploit works by entering the following in the login form:

Username: `admin ' or ' 1=1`
Password:  `Cyber-Zone` (or any other value)
The crafted username value exploits the SQL injection vulnerability to bypass the authentication check.
The SQL query will become something similar to: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin ' or '1=1' AND password = 'password_entered'` which due to `1=1` becoming always true, bypasses password check and allows access as the admin user.
