Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6919:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insecure cookie handling. The application does not properly validate or sanitize cookie values, allowing an attacker to manipulate them to gain administrative privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the normal authentication mechanism by setting a specific cookie value (`auth=fook!admin`).
- **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application trusts the cookie value set by the user without proper validation, leading to the authentication bypass.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the ability to remotely change the administrator's password.
- This gives the attacker full administrative control of the vulnerable application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed remotely using HTTP requests.
- The attacker crafts a specific cookie value and sends it with a request to `profileedit.php`. The attacker also includes the new desired password in the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No specific user credentials are required; the attacker bypasses authentication using the manipulated cookie value.

**Additional details:**
- The exploit works regardless of whether magic quotes are enabled or disabled.
- The provided exploit script uses cURL to send the crafted request.
- The script checks if the password update was successful based on the response.

In summary, CVE-2008-6919 details a vulnerability in TaskDriver 1.3 where an attacker can remotely change the administrator password by setting a specific cookie value and sending a password change request, due to insecure cookie handling.
