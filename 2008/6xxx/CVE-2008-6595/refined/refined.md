- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The extensions `pmk_rssnewsexport` and `cm_rdfexport` fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input, making them vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious SQL code through user-supplied input fields or parameters used by the extensions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to send crafted HTTP requests with malicious SQL code to the vulnerable extensions. No special privileges are required, other than having the ability to interact with the web application where the extensions are installed.
