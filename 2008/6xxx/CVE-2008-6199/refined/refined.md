Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The `backup.php` script in 2532|Gigs version 1.2.2 does not properly validate user authorization, allowing any logged-in user to initiate a database backup.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Authorization Check:** The script lacks a proper check to verify if the user requesting the backup has the necessary permissions to perform this action.
    *   **Direct Access to Backup Functionality:** The backup functionality is directly accessible through a URL with a simple GET parameter (`export=1`).

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can force the application to create a backup of the database and save it to a publicly accessible location (`http://site.com/2532gigs/backup.sql`). This could lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Sensitive data stored in the database (user credentials, personal information, etc.) could be exposed.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** The backup could be used by an attacker to gain more information about the application's internals, potentially leading to further exploits.

*  **Attack vectors:** Attacker sends HTTP GET request to `/backup.php` with `export=1` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Logged-in User:** The attacker needs to be logged in as a regular user within the 2532|Gigs application.
    *   **Access to the vulnerable URL:** The attacker needs to be able to access the `/backup.php` script.
