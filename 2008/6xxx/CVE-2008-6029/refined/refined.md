- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `search` parameter within the `search.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data, and potentially gain full control of the database by injecting malicious SQL queries. The provided exploit attempts to retrieve the `login` and `password` fields from the `bw_admin` table.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `search.php` with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `search` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and know the location of the `search.php` file. The `magic_quotes_gpc` setting on the server needs to be off for the injection to work.
