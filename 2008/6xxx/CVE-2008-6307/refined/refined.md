Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6307:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insecure cookie handling in the E-topbiz Link Back Checker application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application does not properly validate or secure the 'auth' cookie, allowing an attacker to manipulate it.
- Specifically, the 'auth' cookie can be directly set to 'admin' by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By setting the 'auth' cookie to 'admin', an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain administrative access to the application's control panel.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed client-side, by using Javascript.
- The attacker directly modifies the cookie value in the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code, typically by using a web browser.
- No prior authentication or special privileges are required.
- The attacker can be remote, as they can directly interact with the application's interface through a browser.

**Summary:**
The exploit uses JavaScript to set a cookie value of 'auth' to 'admin', bypassing the authentication mechanism and granting the attacker administrative access. This is due to the application's lack of proper cookie validation and security measures.
