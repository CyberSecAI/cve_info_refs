      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_d080bf37_20250124_193040.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of Alternate Data Streams (ADS) by TmaxSoft JEUS. Specifically, JEUS fails to correctly process '::$DATA' within file requests, treating them as normal files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of Alternate Data Streams (ADS)."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote file disclosure, allowing an attacker to obtain web application source files.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker can send a crafted URL request containing '::$DATA' to the server."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
      ],
      "details": "TmaxSoft JEUS, a web application server, does not properly handle NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS). When a URL request such as 'http://www.target.com/foo/bar.jsp::$DATA' is made, the server treats 'test.jsp::$DATA' as a normal file, thus disclosing the contents of the 'test.jsp' file. This is similar to a previous vulnerability found in MS Windows IIS (Bid 0149)."
