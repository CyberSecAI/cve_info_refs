Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6369:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `Ocean12 Contact Manager Pro` application. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and a database disclosure vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `Sort` parameter in the `default.asp` page.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS via the `DisplayFormat` and `Action` parameters.
*   **Database Disclosure:** The application exposes its database file `o12con.mdb` publicly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, read sensitive data, modify data, or execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to full control of the database.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or defacement.
*   **Database Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** By crafting malicious SQL statements in the `Sort` parameter of the `default.asp` page.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `DisplayFormat` and `Action` parameters.
*   **Database Disclosure:** By directly accessing the `o12con.mdb` file through a web request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web application.
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication to trigger these vulnerabilities.
