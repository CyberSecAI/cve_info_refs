- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in the `modules/poll/` component of NetCat CMS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection, where the attacker cannot see the query results directly but can infer information based on the server's response time. The `modules/poll/` component is specifically targeted. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `PollID` parameter when constructing SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code that is evaluated by the database server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database. This includes user logins and password hashes, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `/modules/poll/` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of a valid user ID within the system to retrieve the corresponding credentials.
