- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses an insecure method for handling cookies. The cookie contains the username, a hashed password, and the username again, along with a trailing '0'. The application only checks the username from the cookie for authentication, neglecting the password hash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure cookie handling, authentication bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create a forged cookie with an arbitrary username (e.g., 'sysop') and bypass the authentication mechanism to gain privileged access.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a specially formatted cookie and injecting it into the client's browser, an attacker can impersonate any user, including administrators.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to set a cookie value within the victim's browser. This can be done through javascript injection.
