Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `targetid` parameter of the `click.php` script in the Adult Banner Exchange Website application and in Banner Exchange Script 1.0. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically a blind SQL injection in the Banner Exchange Script 1.0, and a standard SQL injection in the Adult Banner Exchange Website.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The applications do not properly validate or sanitize the `targetid` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, such as user credentials, application configuration data, or other confidential data.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might be able to modify or delete data in the database.
- **Complete Compromise:** In the worst-case scenario, an attacker may be able to gain complete control over the database and potentially the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `click.php` script.
- The vulnerable parameter is `targetid`.
- The attacker injects SQL code into the `targetid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit for the Adult Banner Exchange Website is demonstrated with a `UNION SELECT` statement:
  `www.[target].com/Script/click.php?hostid=1&targetid=-1+union+select+1,version(),user(),4,5--`
- The blind SQL injection vulnerability in Banner Exchange Script 1.0 can be exploited by observing redirection behavior based on true or false conditions in the injected SQL query.
  - True condition: `http://www.site.com/click.php?hostid=[nr1]&targetid=[nr2] and 1=1` (redirects).
  - False condition: `http://www.site.com/click.php?hostid=[nr1]&targetid=[nr2] and 1=2` (does not redirect).
  - Exploitation example: `http://www.site.com/click.php?hostid=[nr1]&targetid=[nr2] and substring(@@version,1,1)=5`
