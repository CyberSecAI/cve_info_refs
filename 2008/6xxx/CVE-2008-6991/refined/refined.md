Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `public/page.php` script, allowing for SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The `id_rub_page` parameter in `public/page.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can potentially:
    *   Extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., user credentials, application data).
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain control of the database server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious SQL query and injecting it through the `id_rub_page` parameter in a GET request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to know how to craft SQL injection payloads.
    *   No authentication required.

The provided example demonstrates a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection, which is used to extract database version, database name, and database user, demonstrating the ability to extract sensitive data.
