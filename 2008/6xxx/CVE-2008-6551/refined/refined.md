The provided content relates to CVE-2008-6551.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The e-Vision CMS 2.0.2 suffers from multiple Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities due to insufficient sanitization of the `module` parameter in various admin modules.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exists in multiple admin modules.
- Lack of input sanitization on the `module` parameter allows an attacker to include local files.
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input which leads to the inclusion of arbitrary files from the server filesystem.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.
- This can lead to information disclosure, which may allow an attacker to gain further access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to various vulnerable admin modules, such as `add3rdparty.php`, `addpolling.php`, etc., with a crafted `module` parameter containing a path to the file they want to include.
- The attacker can also set a `adminlang` cookie with a file path to be included using the `admin/ind_ex.php` page.
-  A null byte can be used to terminate the file path if needed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication.
- The attacker must know the location of the vulnerable scripts.
- Magic quotes GPC must be turned off for the exploit to work correctly.
