Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-6700:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application, Butterfly Organizer 2.0.0, is vulnerable to both SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insecure handling of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `view.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `mytable` and `id` GET parameters and multiple files are vulnerable to XSS through various GET parameters.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The `view.php` script directly concatenates the `mytable` and `id` GET parameters into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple scripts including `view.php`, `viewdb2.php`, `category-rename.php`, and `module-contacts.php` are vulnerable to XSS by reflecting unsanitized user-supplied input from GET parameters.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially allowing them to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data (such as usernames, passwords, or other database information), modify database records, or even gain full control over the database server.
        *   The provided proof of concept demonstrates extracting usernames and passwords from the database.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can allow them to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface pages, or perform other actions within the context of the user's browser session.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Sending crafted HTTP GET requests to `view.php` with malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter. The `mytable` parameter is also used in the injection.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Sending crafted HTTP GET requests to `view.php`, `viewdb2.php`, `category-rename.php`, or `module-contacts.php` with malicious JavaScript in the `mytable` or other vulnerable parameters such as `letter` .
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They do not need prior authentication to exploit the listed vulnerabilities.
    *   For XSS, they must trick a user into accessing the crafted link, or inject the crafted link into a website that other users may visit.
