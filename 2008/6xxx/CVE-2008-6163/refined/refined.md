Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a blind SQL injection flaw within the `bannerid` parameter of the `ac.php` script in OpenX. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, meaning that the attacker doesn't directly see the output of the SQL queries in the response. Instead, the attacker infers the results based on whether the application returns a 200 OK response or not.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The application fails to sanitize the `bannerid` parameter, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected and executed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data exfiltration: The attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords. The provided exploit code specifically targets the `ox_users` table to extract credentials by using `concat(username,0x3A,password)`.
- Potential for further attacks: By gaining access to user credentials, an attacker could potentially compromise the entire OpenX installation and the underlying server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `ac.php` script, specifically by manipulating the `bannerid` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable OpenX server. No special privileges on the system or access to the database are necessary to exploit this flaw.
- The attacker must know the path to the vulnerable script `ac.php` within the OpenX installation.
- The attacker needs to craft a SQL injection payload using techniques for blind SQL injection.

**More detail than the official CVE description:**
The provided content includes an actual exploit script written in PHP. This script demonstrates the blind SQL injection technique and automates the extraction of data by using techniques such as substring comparisons within the injected SQL queries. It also provides specific details such as the vulnerable parameter (`bannerid`), the vulnerable file (`ac.php`), and the targeted table (`ox_users`). This level of detail is more specific than the general description usually found in a CVE entry.
