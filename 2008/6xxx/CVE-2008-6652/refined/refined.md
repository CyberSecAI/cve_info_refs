```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization in the `sitename` parameter within the `asd.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Blind SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data such as user passwords from the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed remotely by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `asd.php` file with a malicious SQL query in the `sitename` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is required. The attacker also requires knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious payload."
