Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6358:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content from Exploit-DB explicitly mentions "CVE: [2008-6358](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-6358)" and provides exploit details for it, confirming its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `group_index.php` file of Social Groupie. Specifically, the `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the `id` parameter of `group_index.php`, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - The provided exploit demonstrates that an attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, from the `tbl_admin` table. This can lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `group_index.php` file, where the `id` parameter is manipulated with SQL injection payload.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and knowledge of SQL injection techniques. No special access to the server or the application is required.
    - The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details (From Exploit-DB):**

*   **Vulnerable Application:**  Social Groupie
*   **Platform:** PHP
*   **Exploit Example:**
    ```
    http://www.site.me/group_index.php?id=-1067+Union+select+0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,concat(username,0x3a,password),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0+from+tbl_admin--
    ```

**Summary:**

CVE-2008-6358 describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Social Groupie application's `group_index.php` file, specifically through the `id` parameter. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a crafted HTTP GET request to extract sensitive data from the database, potentially leading to full system compromise. The exploit is remote, and requires the ability to send HTTP requests with knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
