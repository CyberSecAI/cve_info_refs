- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses a cookie named `sLanguage` to determine the language to use and this cookie is vulnerable to local file inclusion (LFI). The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input via the `sLanguage` cookie, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, potentially gaining access to configuration files, source code, or other confidential data. In the example provided the attacker reads `boot.ini` from a Windows system, or could target `/etc/passwd` on a Linux system.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `sLanguage` cookie, an attacker can inject a path to a local file, causing the application to include and potentially execute it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a modified cookie to the vulnerable web application.
