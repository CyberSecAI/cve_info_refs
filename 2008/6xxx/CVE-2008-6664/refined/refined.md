{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure cookie handling.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application directly uses the 'shuser' and 'shpass' cookies from the client-side to authenticate the user without proper validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism by setting arbitrary values for the 'shuser' and 'shpass' cookies, gaining unauthorized access to the application's admin functionalities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker manipulates the 'shuser' and 'shpass' cookies through JavaScript on the client-side.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable website. This could be through direct interaction with the website or via other means such as a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability."
