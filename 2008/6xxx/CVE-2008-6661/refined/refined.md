```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple integer overflows when analyzing corrupted PE binaries packed with neolite and asprotect packers.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Integer overflows.
- Impact of exploitation: Remote DoS, possibly remote code execution.
- Attack vectors:  Corrupted PE binaries packed with neolite and asprotect packers.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker would need to be able to provide a crafted, corrupted PE binary to the vulnerable software.
