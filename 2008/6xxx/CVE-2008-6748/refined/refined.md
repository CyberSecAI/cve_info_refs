```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Megacubo application's "mega://" URI handler allows passing arbitrary PHP code to its "play" command. This code is then copied to a temporary file and evaluated using the `eval()` function. A file existence check is bypassed using a windows device name as an argument.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unsafe use of the PHP `eval()` function, lack of proper input validation when handling "mega://" URI scheme.
- Impact of exploitation: Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious "mega://" URI, which can be triggered via a website link or other means of user interaction that opens the URI, or through other means that can trigger the `mega://` URI handler.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to get a victim to open a specially crafted `mega://` URI. This could be achieved by tricking the user to click a link or other means to trigger the URI handler, the attacker can be remote.
