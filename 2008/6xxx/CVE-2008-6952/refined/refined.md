Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6952:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an arbitrary file upload issue within MauryCMS version 0.53.2 and prior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The CMS allows users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation or sanitization.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application doesn't sufficiently check the uploaded file's content or type.
*   **SQL Injection:** Used to extract login information from the database to bypass authentication controls to access the file upload functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP script (e.g., a web shell) and execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the web server and potentially the entire system.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Attackers may gain access to sensitive data, modify existing data or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The attack is performed remotely over HTTP/HTTPS.
*   **Web Interface:** Exploitation involves interaction with the web interface of the CMS.
*   **File Upload Functionality:** The vulnerability lies within the file upload mechanism of the application
*   **SQL Injection:** The exploit utilizes an SQL injection vulnerability within Rss.php to retrieve authentication cookies required to perform the file upload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the target server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability in MauryCMS and its exploitation method.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable page with appropriate parameters, including crafted SQL injection and malicious file content.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The exploit script provided in the exploit-db entry demonstrates how to retrieve the authentication cookies via SQL injection in the Rss.php file and then use those cookies to submit a malicious file via the Admin.php page.
*   The vulnerability lies within the file upload mechanism within the Admin.php page, accessible after authentication.
