Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` script of PHPwebnews 0.2 MySQL Edition. The `id_kat` GET parameter is directly included in a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is a **SQL Injection (SQLi)** vulnerability. The lack of input validation on the `id_kat` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   Extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (`user` and `passwd` fields).
    *   Potentially modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the application and potentially the underlying server.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL, specifically by manipulating the `id_kat` GET parameter.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, meaning they can be a remote unauthenticated user.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is as follows:

```php
$id_kat=$_GET[id_kat];
$m_conn = db_connect();
if ((empty($id_kat))||($id_kat==''))
	$m_sql = "select * from berita where status='tampil' and order by tgl desc";
else
	$m_sql = "select * from berita where status='tampil' and kode_kategori=$id_kat and isi_berita like %'$m_txt'% order by tgl desc";
```

The exploit provided in the content uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `user` table by injecting the following SQL string as the `id_kat` parameter:
```
null+UNION+ALL+SELECT+1,2,3,4,concat(user,0x3a,passwd),6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13+FROM+user--
```
This bypasses the intended query, effectively extracting user and password information, the `0x3a` is the hex code for a colon(:), which will be inserted between the user and password.
