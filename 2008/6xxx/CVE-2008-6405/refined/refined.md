Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability present in the `showcategory.php` script of the HotScripts Clone application. The `cid` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization of the `cid` parameter in the `showcategory.php` script, which allows for arbitrary SQL queries to be executed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive data disclosure: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, including administrator usernames and passwords (specifically from the `sbwmd_admin` table), potentially leading to full compromise of the application.
- Data manipulation: The attacker can potentially modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `showcategory.php` with a malicious payload within the `cid` parameter.
- Example URL: `www.[target].com/Script/showcategory.php?cid=-27+UNION+SELECT+1,concat(admin_name,0x3a,pwd),3,4,5,6+FROM+sbwmd_admin--`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable application: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the HotScripts Clone application.
- Basic knowledge of SQL: The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection payloads.
