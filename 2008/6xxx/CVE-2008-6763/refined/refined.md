{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Insecure cookie handling. The application sets a cookie with the username as its value, rather than a more secure identifier like a session ID or a hash of the password.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The application uses the username as the cookie value, which is easily guessable or obtainable, allowing for unauthorized access if a user's username is known.",
		"Lack of proper session management using unique tokens or cryptographic values."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a user's account by setting a cookie with the user's username. This allows the attacker to bypass authentication checks and gain access to the application.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker can craft a malicious javascript code to set the 'logged_in' cookie in the user's browser."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the target user's username or have access to it. They need to be able to execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of a user's browser, which can be accomplished through various cross site scripting or other browser based vulnerabilities."
