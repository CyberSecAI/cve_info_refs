Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `image_gallery.php` file of the e107 Image Gallery plugin. Specifically, the `image` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `image` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** An attacker can leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials (usernames and passwords).
- **Data Modification:** It's also possible an attacker could modify or delete data in the database through the same vulnerability.
- **Potential for further compromise:** In some cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to gain further access to the underlying system, beyond just the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `image_gallery.php` script.
- **Manipulated Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `image` parameter within the URL to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable e107 instance.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit does not indicate any authentication requirement.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the malicious queries.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit demonstrates how an attacker can extract user information from the `e107_user` table using a `UNION SELECT` statement:

```
http://www.site.com/e107_Path/image_gallery/image_gallery.php?page=image-detail&album=1&image=-9999+UNION+SELECT+concat_ws(char(58),user_name,user_password)KHG+from+e107_user+where+user_id=1--
```
The SQL injection payload extracts the `user_name` and `user_password` from the first user in the table by using a `UNION SELECT` to inject arbitrary sql query.
