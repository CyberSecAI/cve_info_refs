- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization, specifically in the authentication mechanism. It allows for SQL injection through the username field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability in the login form.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized administrative access to the web application.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack is performed through the web interface by injecting a malicious SQL query into the username field of the login form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the web application. They also need to be aware of the injection vulnerability.
