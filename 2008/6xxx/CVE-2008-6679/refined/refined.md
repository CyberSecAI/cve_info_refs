Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-6679:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that exists within the `BaseFont` writer module of the `pdfwrite` device in Ghostscript. This is due to an incorrect calculation of the buffer size when writing font data in the PDF output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer is allocated with insufficient space when writing font data, leading to a buffer overflow during the `sprintf` operation in the `pdf_base_font_alloc` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A specially crafted PostScript file can cause the `ps2pdf` tool (used to convert PostScript to PDF) to crash due to the buffer overflow.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by carefully crafting the PostScript file to overwrite memory in a specific way during the overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted PostScript File:** The attack vector involves providing a malicious PostScript file to the vulnerable `ps2pdf` tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted PostScript file to a system using the vulnerable Ghostscript version and trigger the vulnerable code path, usually by converting the file to PDF using `ps2pdf`. This could be through a web application that takes user supplied ps files or simply a user that uses `ps2pdf`

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Ghostscript version 8.62 and possibly other versions.
*   A patch was created to address the issue by allocating a buffer large enough to handle the worst-case scenario.
*   The fix was committed as revision 9304.

**Summary of relevant information from different sources:**

*   **openwall.com:** Provides the initial CVE request information, mentioning the buffer overflow in the BaseFont writer module and pointing to the upstream bug report and patch.
*   **bugs.ghostscript.com:** Contains the upstream bug report (Bug 690211), including the description, a test case, and the patch. It also includes the stack trace of where the overflow occurs and confirms the overflow is due to incorrect buffer calculation, causing the `sprintf` to write beyond buffer limits.
*  **bugzilla.redhat.com:** Tracks the vulnerability (Bug 493445), links to the CVE entry, and indicates that it has been fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via RHSA-2009:0421, and Fedora 9 and 10.  A Proof-of-Concept is attached to this bug.
*   **lists.opensuse.org:** Includes this CVE in a security summary report, confirming the buffer overflow in the BaseFont writer module of ghostscript, and specifying it is fixed in the updated version.
