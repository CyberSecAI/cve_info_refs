- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper authentication checks, allowing unauthenticated access to administrative pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass. The application does not require authentication to access admin pages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Full access to the administrative panel. This could allow an attacker to modify the website, user data or any other admin features available.
- **Attack vectors**: Directly accessing the admin pages via their URLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: None, the attacker needs only network connectivity to the web server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
