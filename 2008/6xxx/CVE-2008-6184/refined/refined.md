Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6184:

**CVE Description:**

The provided text does not contain the official CVE description.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the `catid` parameter of the `com_ownbiblio` component for Joomla!.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The `catid` parameter in the `index.php?option=com_ownbiblio&view=catalogue` URL is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially allowing them to:
    *   Extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., usernames and passwords).
    *   Modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Potentially gain administrative access to the application.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is accessed via HTTP requests by manipulating the `catid` parameter in the URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! instance.
    *   No authentication is explicitly stated to be required for exploitation.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** Joomla! Component `com_ownbiblio` version 1.5.3
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `catid`
*   **Exploit Example:**
    ```
    /index.php?option=com_ownbiblio&view=catalogue&catid=-1+union+all+select+1,2,concat(username,char(58),password)KHG,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16+from+jos_users--
    ```
    This example demonstrates how an attacker can use a SQL `UNION` statement to extract the username and password from the `jos_users` table.

**Additional Notes:**

* The exploit-db entry provides a specific example of how to exploit this vulnerability to extract user credentials from the database.
* The provided text also includes a dork that can be used to find vulnerable sites.
* There is a reference to this exploit being reported on milw0rm.com (now defunct).

This vulnerability allows an attacker to directly manipulate database queries, which can lead to severe consequences.
