Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6934

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `guestbook.php` file of the FREEsimplePHPGuestbook application. Specifically, the application does not adequately filter data submitted through the "Name", "Web site", and "Message" fields, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The core vulnerability is that an attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code into the message field, which is then executed when the guestbook page is rendered. This allows for the execution of arbitrary system commands or any other code allowed by the webserver.
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing for the injection of HTML and PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Full System Compromise:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the web server. This can lead to full control of the server.
* **Data Breach:** With arbitrary code execution, an attacker can access sensitive data on the server, potentially leading to a data breach.
* **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can leverage the vulnerability to host malware or redirect the website to malicious pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is the `guestbook.php` web page, specifically the form where users enter their name, website, and message.
* **HTTP GET Request:** After injecting the malicious code via the form, the attacker triggers execution through a specially crafted HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable web server.
* **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of web form submission and HTTP requests.
* **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit involves the following steps:

1.  **Inject malicious PHP code:** Enter a malicious PHP code, such as `<? passthru($_GET[tryag]); ?>` into the "Message" field while submitting a new guestbook entry using the application form.
2.  **Trigger code execution:** After the form is submitted,  the attacker then triggers the execution of the injected PHP code by visiting the guestbook page with a specially crafted GET request, like `http://www.sanusart.com/php/test/guestbook/guestbook.php?tryag=id`.
3.  **Command execution:** The `passthru($_GET[tryag]);` part of the injected code allows the execution of arbitrary system commands. For example,  `?tryag=id` would execute the `id` command on the webserver.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Exploit-DB entry provides a clear example and steps of how to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable application is identified as `FREEsimplePHPGuestbook`.
