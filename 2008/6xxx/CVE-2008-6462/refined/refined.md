The provided content is a security bulletin from TYPO3, specifically **TYPO3-20080919-1**, which details multiple vulnerabilities found in various third-party TYPO3 extensions.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause across the listed vulnerabilities stems from insecure coding practices within the third-party extensions. These include:

*   **SQL Injection:** Improper handling of user-supplied input within SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. This allows attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, modifying data, or even executing arbitrary code on the database server.
*   **Blind SQL Injection**: Similar to SQL injection but the attacker does not receive immediate feedback from the database. Attackers can infer data by timing responses or trigger errors.
*   **Information disclosure:** The `file_list` extension had a flaw that led to information disclosure, though the specifics are not provided.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** The `kw_secdir` extension had a vulnerability that allowed for arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection vulnerabilities were found in:
    *   `autobeuser` (auto BE User Registration)
    *  `cgswigmore` (Swigmore institute)
    *   `dmaddredit` (FE address edit for tt\_address & direct mail)
    *   `mw_random_objects` (Simple Random Objects)
    *   `myquizpoll` (My quiz and poll)
    *    `ste_prayer2` (Random Prayer Version 2)
*   Blind SQL Injection vulnerabilities were found in:
    *   `h_book` (HBook)
    *   `pd_churchsearch` (Diocese of Portsmouth Church Search)
    *   `wrg_anotherbelogin` (Another Backend Login)
*   Information disclosure vulnerability in:
    *   `file_list` (File List)
*  Arbitrary code execution in:
    *   `kw_secdir` (Secure Directory)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection**: Could allow attackers to:
    *   Access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
    *   Potentially gain unauthorized access to the application.
    *   In some cases, execute arbitrary code on the database server.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Similar to SQL injection but more difficult to exploit. Attackers can retrieve information from the database by observing server response times or by triggering errors.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Allows attackers to gain access to files or other information they should not have access to.
*   **Arbitrary code execution**: Could allow attackers to execute code on the server, potentially taking full control of the web application or server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the vulnerable third-party extensions, which are not part of the default TYPO3 installation.
*   Attackers would need to identify sites running vulnerable versions of these extensions.
*   For SQL injection, attackers would likely manipulate input fields to inject malicious SQL queries.
*   For arbitrary code execution, attackers would likely exploit a vulnerability in the extension's code, possibly related to how it handles file uploads, or input parameters.
*   The information disclosure would be through a flaw in how the `file_list` extension displays or exposes files/information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to interact with the web application's front-end or back-end, where the vulnerable extensions are installed and exposed.
*   For SQL injection, the attacker needs to be able to send crafted SQL queries to the database.
*   For arbitrary code execution, the attacker needs to exploit a vulnerability in the extension to upload/execute malicious code on the server.
*   For information disclosure, the attacker needs to be able to access the page that is vulnerable.
