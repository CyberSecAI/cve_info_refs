  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application suffers from SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to retrieve usernames and passwords from the database. XSS vulnerabilities can be used to execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser.",
  "Attack vectors": {
        "SQL Injection": [
            "http://[Target]/os/index.php?view=[SQL Injection]",
