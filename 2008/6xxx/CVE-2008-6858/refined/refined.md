Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6858

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Insecure cookie handling. The application does not properly secure the cookie used for authentication, allowing an attacker to manipulate it.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper security measures for the authentication cookie. Specifically, it appears that the application uses a cookie named `xlaABM_usr` which contains the user ID and company information, and this cookie is not properly secured.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By manipulating the `xlaABM_usr` cookie, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to the application with administrative privileges. In this specific exploit, they set the cookie to `userid=administrator&company=Sytem Administrator` gaining administrative access.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is client-side manipulation of the cookie.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser or have the ability to set the cookie in the browser, and they need to know the cookie name. The provided exploit demonstrates this by using a javascript code injection to modify the cookie prior to access the vulnerable page, which means the user has to have already access to the application or the attacker needs to be able to convince the user to execute the exploit javascript.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit targets "Absolute Banner Manager" which is available at `http://www.xigla.com/absolutebmnet/demo.htm`
*   The provided exploit demonstrates how to inject a specific cookie to gain admin access and bypass the login page.
*   The exploit shows that the application uses `xlaABM_usr` cookie with values like `userid` and `company`
