Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerability 1: Directory Traversal**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `print.php` script's `page` parameter is vulnerable. The application does not sanitize user-supplied input in the `page` parameter allowing the use of directory traversal sequences like "../../".
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation and lack of sanitization of user input.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can access files outside of the web root and current directory, potentially revealing sensitive information or configuration files.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting a malicious HTTP request with the `page` parameter containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  An attacker can send HTTP requests with a crafted `page` parameter.

**Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `index.php` script's `action` and `page` parameters are vulnerable. User-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.
*  **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation and lack of sanitization of user input.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script code into a user's browser session, in the context of the affected website. This could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a malicious HTTP request with the `action` or `page` parameters containing malicious JavaScript or HTML code.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can send HTTP requests with crafted `action` or `page` parameters.

**Vulnerability 3: Session Fixation**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows the `PHPSESSID` parameter to be set to an arbitrary value.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application does not properly generate session IDs or invalidate pre-existing session IDs when a user logs in.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can fix a user's session ID before they log in, and then use that same session ID to impersonate the user after they have authenticated.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker can set a `PHPSESSID` cookie in the user's browser or pass it through the URL before the user authenticates.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can manipulate the `PHPSESSID` parameter value.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by David Vieira-Kurz of MajorSecurity.
*   The affected versions are moziloWiki 1.0.1 and prior.
*   A patch (version 1.0.2) was released to fix the vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory was published on September 30, 2008.
