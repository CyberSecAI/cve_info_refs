{
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the application's Microsoft Access database file (News.mdb) is publicly accessible through a predictable URL.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Insecure direct object reference",
     "Information disclosure"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can directly download the database file, potentially exposing sensitive information including user credentials, news content, and other application data.",
  "attack_vector": "The attacker can access the database by directly requesting the predictable URL where the database file is located (e.g. SITE.COM/Database/News.mdb)",
  "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know or guess the path to the database file to be able to access and download it. No authentication is required."
