  "cve_id": "CVE-2008-6649",
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_7a2178b9_20250125_000631.html",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `gid` parameter within the `crumbs.php` file and the `id` parameter within the `image_details_editor.php` file.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "SQL Injection"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "HTTP GET request with a crafted `gid` parameter to `crumbs.php` (included in another script like `about_us.php`)",
          "HTTP GET request with a crafted `id` parameter to `manager/image_details_editor.php`"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit these specific vulnerabilities. The attacker must know the location of the vulnerable scripts or have the ability to locate them through other vulnerabilities. The exploit for `crumbs.php` is only successful if magic quotes are off.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability in `crumbs.php` is triggered when the script is included by another script like `about_us.php`. The `crumbs.php` script itself doesn't work as an entry point, because there's no valid database resource available when directly accessed. The exploit for `crumbs.php` is only successful if `magic_quotes` is set to off. The exploit examples provided include `UNION SELECT` statements to extract database information, specifically usernames and passwords from `mgr_users` table."
