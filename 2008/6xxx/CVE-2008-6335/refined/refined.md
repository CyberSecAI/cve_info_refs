Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6335:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** flaw in the `download.php` script of the "Online Keyword Research Tool". The script does not properly sanitize or validate the `filename` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsanitized Input:** The `filename` parameter is directly used in the file inclusion process without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Local File Inclusion:** The application allows the inclusion of local files through the `download.php` script, which can lead to sensitive file disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to read sensitive files from the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, which contains user account information.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Depending on the server's configuration and included files, further exploitation could be possible such as remote code execution through log poisoning.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the `download.php` script, providing the path to the targeted file in the `filename` parameter. This is done through URL manipulation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server to send the malicious request.
*   **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that the application is vulnerable to LFI through the vulnerable `download.php` script and know the relevant OS paths.

**Additional Notes**

* The provided exploit-db content gives a clear example of the exploit by showing a direct usage of the `filename` parameter to access a file outside of the application's document root: `http://www.rightscripts.com/keywordresearch/download.php?filename=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
* This vulnerability is specific to the `download.php` script.
* The Secunia content is unrelated as it discusses their research team.
