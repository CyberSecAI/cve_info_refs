*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Database access: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access the database, potentially reading sensitive information, modifying data, or even gaining full control of the database server. In this specific case, the provided examples demonstrate the ability to extract usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   HTTP GET request: The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable Joomla component.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Network access: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Joomla application.
    *   Knowledge of vulnerable component: The attacker needs to know that the `com_dailymessage` component is installed and vulnerable.
    *   Ability to craft malicious URL: The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs with SQL injection payloads.

*   **More details than CVE:** The provided content offers specific details not in the general CVE description, including:
    *   The vulnerable component is `com_dailymessage` version 1.0.3.
