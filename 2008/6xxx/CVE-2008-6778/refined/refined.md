Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6778:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **blind SQL injection** flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The `viewfaqs.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `cat` parameter.
*   The vulnerability is **blind**, meaning the attacker does not directly see the results of the injected SQL queries in the response, but can infer based on the response (e.g., whether the page loads successfully or not).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can use this vulnerability to potentially extract sensitive information from the database. This may include user credentials, administrative data, and other confidential information stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **remote**.
*   The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL with SQL injection payload in the `cat` parameter of the `viewfaqs.php` script.
*   Example of proof of concept is given as:
    *   `http://localhost/viewfaqs.php?cat=1+and+1=1` true
    *   `http://localhost/viewfaqs.php?cat=1+and+1=1` false

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerable software is identified as SFS EZ Auction.
* The exploit example provided shows how to extract the database version using the `substring` and `@@version` SQL functions in a blind SQL injection context.
