Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the yappa-ng PHP photo gallery application. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a failure to sanitize user input, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts. This falls under CWE-79.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser when they access a website using the vulnerable yappa-ng software.
- This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, cookie theft, phishing attacks, and other client-side attacks depending on the attacker's intentions and the specific script injected.
- The vulnerability compromises the integrity of the website from a user perspective.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the network (AV:N). An attacker can inject malicious script via a network request to the vulnerable yappa-ng application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated (PR:N).
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious script and inject it into a vulnerable parameter of the yappa-ng application.
- The attacker relies on the victim's user interaction to execute the script within their browser (UI:R).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in yappa-ng version 2.3.2.
- The vendor was unreachable and has not provided a fix.
- The vulnerability was validated on CentOS 7.8.2003 with Apache 2.4.6, PHP 5.4.16, and yappa-ng 2.3.2, and tested on Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 and Google Chrome 83.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as Medium with a CVSS v3 score of 6.1 and a CVSS v2 score of 4.3.

**Recommendation:**
The recommended solution is to stop using yappa-ng 2.3.2 due to the lack of a fix and the unreachability of the developer.
