How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# JVN#55833077 yappa-ng vulnerable to cross-site scripting

## Overview

yappa-ng contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

## Vendor Information

Developer: yet another PHP photo album next generation (according to the original report submitted by the reporter)

Product name and version: yappa-ng 2.3.2

## Description

yappa-ng <http://www.zirkon.at/zirkon/scripts/yappa-ng/yappa-ng\_main\_eng.html> provided by yet another PHP photo album next generation (according to the original report submitted by the reporter) is a PHP photo gallery.

yappa-ng contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability ([CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)) which allows unintentional script execution on the user's web browser.

## Impact

An arbitrary script may be executed on the web browser of the user who is accessing a website that uses yappa-ng.

## Solution

**Consider stop using yappa-ng 2.3.2**

Since the developer was unreachable, existence of any mitigations is unknown.

## Vendor Opinion

None provided

## JPCERT/CC Addendum

During the meeting of Committee for authorizing the disclosure of unresolved vulnerabilities held on January 22, 2021, it was judged that an advisory for this vulnerability shall be disclosed since all the criteria and conditions described below which are stated in [Standards for Handling Vulnerability related Information of Software Products and Other](http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/netsecurity/vul_notification.pdf) and [Information Security Early Warning Partnership Guideline](https://www.ipa.go.jp/files/000073901.pdf) have been satisfied.

1. The developer of the product is unreachable:

   JPCERT/CC had tried to reach the developer for a period of time (more than 6 months) however there were no responses from the developer. Therefore the committee reached the conclusion that it is reasonable and appropriate to judge the developer is unreachable.

   - No response to 6 separate emails (sent from October 5, 2006 to September 12, 2011)

   - No response to disclosure of the developer's name (listed on September 29, 2011) in "[List of unreachable developers](https://jvn.jp/en/reply/)" and to the disclosure of the name and its version (listed on December 16, 2011) in “[Information Resuest](https://jvn.jp/en/reply/DID65663418.html)” on JVN

   - No response to the announcement of screening procedure for vulnerability disclosure (sent on December 21, 2020)

3. Existence of vulnerability has been verified:

   It was verified that the product contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability by IPA. Arbitrary script execution on the user's web browser was confirmed which violates the "Integrity" of the product. For verification details, refer to the “Verification” section.

5. Not disclosing this case may result in the risk that product users will have no means to know of the existence of the vulnerability in the product:

   By checking the developer’s website, it is assumed that users are permitted to copy, revise, or distribute the product, and it is downloadable via internet. Therefore, the developer cannot directly contact all users of this product to notify of the cross-site scripting vulnerability.  It was determined that disclosure of this vulnerability is legitimate under these conditions.

7. There are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate:

   After considering the developer’s stance and the risk to product users, the committee has judged that there are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate or that disclosure may cause any other issues.
