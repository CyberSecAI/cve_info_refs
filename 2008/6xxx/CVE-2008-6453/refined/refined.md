Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6453
*   **Vulnerable Software:** 6rbScript v3.3
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Local File Inclusion (LFI)
*   **Root Cause:** The `section.php` script in 6rbScript v3.3 is vulnerable to LFI. The `name` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include local files on the server.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input sanitization on the `name` parameter in `section.php`.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL that contains directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../`) in the `name` parameter. For example: `site.il/section.php?name=../../../../etc/passwd`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `section.php` script. The attacker does not need any authentication or privileges on the server.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`. This could lead to information disclosure and further compromise of the server.
*  **Conditions:** The exploit requires magic quotes to be off and open base dir to be off on the server.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit was verified by the Exploit Database.
