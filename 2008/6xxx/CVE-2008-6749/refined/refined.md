Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6749

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `usercheck.php` and `add.php` files of FlexPHPDirectory v0.0.1. Specifically, the SQL query used for authentication in `usercheck.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input when constructing the SQL query used for authentication.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting SQL code into the username/password fields, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism. Specifically, injecting `' or '1=1` as both the username and password will result in a successful login.
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The `add.php` file allows for arbitrary file uploads, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Complete Compromise:** Attackers can bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the application.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Once authenticated, the attacker can upload a malicious PHP shell via `add.php` and execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining full control of the affected system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
    *   **HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the `admin/index.php` page.
    *   **File Upload:** The attacker uses a crafted HTTP request to upload a malicious PHP shell through `add.php`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the server running FlexPHPDirectory.
    *   **Basic web skills:** The attacker needs to know how to craft HTTP requests and how to use a web browser.
    *   **No authentication required to exploit:** The attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to bypass authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit is for FlexPHPDirectory v0.0.1.
*   The exploit information includes the vulnerable files (`usercheck.php` and `add.php`), the vulnerable SQL query, the SQL injection payload, and the procedure to upload a shell.
* The Exploit-DB entry for this CVE also mentions a related CVE, CVE-2008-6750
