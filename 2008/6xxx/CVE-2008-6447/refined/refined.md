{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the EasyMail ActiveX control (emmailstore.dll).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution through a crafted HTML page. The exploit leverages a heap spray technique to place the shellcode at a predictable memory address, enabling execution upon the overflow.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious HTML page that instantiates the vulnerable ActiveX control and calls the `CreateStore` method with a specially crafted long string.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious HTML page and entice a victim to open it in a browser that supports ActiveX controls.  The attacker does not need prior authentication or access to the victim's system other than the ability to have them load the crafted HTML.  The victim's system must have the vulnerable ActiveX control installed."
