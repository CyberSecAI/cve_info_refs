```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by unsanitized user input in the `cat` parameter of the `directory.php` script, which is then directly used in an SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database (such as database version, database name), or potentially modify or delete data. It could also potentially lead to complete compromise of the database server and underlying system if the database user has sufficient permissions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is via an HTTP GET request to the `directory.php` script, specifically by manipulating the `cat` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No special privileges or internal network access is required."
