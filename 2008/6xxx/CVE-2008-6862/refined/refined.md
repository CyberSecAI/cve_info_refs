{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure cookie handling",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application uses a cookie (`xlaACRDEMOuser`) to store user information. This cookie is not properly secured, allowing an attacker to manipulate it and potentially bypass authentication or gain unauthorized access.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application by modifying the cookie. This could lead to privilege escalation, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed by manipulating the `xlaACRDEMOuser` cookie using JavaScript.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable application, which can be achieved by navigating to the application's login page and executing the provided JavaScript, and access the application."
