| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c0)  Michael Vogt    2008-11-19 18:45:16 UTC  ``` When gnome-screensaver is used with the compiz expo plugin, the screensaver can be bypassed when expo is put onto a mouse modified. It seems like the reason for this is that the keyboard is grabbed, but the mouse pointer is released from the grab when the unlock dialog comes up (gs-manager.c:1106). ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c1)  Michael Vogt    2008-11-20 17:12:39 UTC  ``` I looked into this a bit and it seems like its difficult (impossible?) to have a gdk_grab_pointer() for the GtkPlug that shows the unlock dialog. Without a pointer grab I see not a lot of options to prevent expo from being activated.   g-s-s could talk to compiz via dbus and disable expo while the dialog is up. This is obviously a pretty suboptimal solution. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c2)  William Jon McCann    2008-11-20 19:50:14 UTC  ``` Thanks for the report.  Ray and I haven't been able to reproduce this.  Could you describe exactly what you do to make this happen?  What exacly do you mean by "bypass"?  The most we've been able to do is to have the expo plugin show 4 side by side locked screens.  Thanks. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c3)  Michael Vogt    2008-11-20 21:22:18 UTC  ``` Thanks for your replay and sorry that I wasn't more clear in my initial report.   I did the following: 1. open compizconfig-settings-manager (ccsm) 2. go to "expo" and then "Bindings"  3. set "Expo button" to something like "<Shift>Button1" 4. lock the screen  5. press shift-button1 -> this triggers compiz to go into expo  mode 6. drag the black background gnome-screensaver window aside (just click and move the window) 7. use shift-button1 to again to go to the desktop again   (the "expo button" binding is disabled by default in upstream compiz).  I hope this is better, if anything is unclear I'm happy to try to describe it better (this is tested with compiz 0.7.8 and gnome-screeensaver 2.24.0).  Thanks,  Michael ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c4)  Michael Vogt    2008-11-21 11:01:04 UTC  ``` After some further debugging and discussing with compiz upstream it looks like its a compiz problem (quoting one of the main developers): "<maniac103> mvo: expo doesn't filter override_redirect windows ... "   Sorry for the noise. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c5)  Michael Vogt    2008-11-21 11:02:11 UTC  ``` For reference: <http://gitweb.compiz-fusion.org/?p=fusion/plugins/expo;a=commit;h=f97a9fa6f0ad578f674d1f248bd7bef90e3260e0> is the compiz commit ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c6)  eMBee    2008-12-09 09:45:10 UTC  ``` the compiz fix only prevents moving the screensaver window, it does not prevent activating the expo plugin nor does it prevent the expo plugin from receiving mouse events. in this case it is still possible to move windows around (even if they can't be seen).  for proper locking NO event must be allowed to be received by anything except the lock window. therefore this IS a gnome/gtk issue. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c7)  eMBee    2008-12-09 10:07:47 UTC  ``` xscreensaver behaves properly btw, so this shows that correct locking is possible and does not depend on how compiz/expo handles mouse events ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c8)  Danny Baumann    2008-12-19 11:19:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c6)) > the compiz fix only prevents moving the screensaver window, it does not prevent > activating the expo plugin nor does it prevent the expo plugin from receiving > mouse events. in this case it is still possible to move windows around (even if > they can't be seen).  I fail to see how this is possible. expo goes through the window stack (top-down) until it finds a window your pointer is in. If it is and you're allowed to move it (not override_redirect, move action set etc.), movement is initiated. Otherwise, movement is cancelled. Could you provide steps to reproduce what you're describing?  > for proper locking NO event must be allowed to be received by anything except > the lock window. therefore this IS a gnome/gtk issue.  Well, yeah.   ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c9)  eMBee    2008-12-19 12:36:15 UTC  ``` * set up a few large (easier to grab) windows on different viewports (remember where they are) * lock the screen * invoke expo * try to grab a window from a different viewport (not the one you are on while invoking expo) and move. you will see the active viewport highlight as you move the window. * release the mouse and unlock screensaver * find a window moved... ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c10)  Danny Baumann    2008-12-19 12:59:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c9)) > * set up a few large (easier to grab) windows on different viewports (remember > where they are) > * lock the screen > * invoke expo > * try to grab a window from a different viewport (not the one you are on while > invoking expo) and move. you will see the active viewport highlight as you move > the window. > * release the mouse and unlock screensaver > * find a window moved...  The requirement to be on a different viewport than the moved window was the missing link. Fixed (commit 991de5e00758a236b31ee60ed31a7d605a0a76d4 in expo), thanks.  ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c11)  eMBee    2008-12-19 17:15:45 UTC  ``` thanks. i only discovered that missing link after you asked.  it is great that expo is being fixed, but i am still wondering how it is possible that expo gets access to mouse events in the first place. this is still an issue that imho needs to be fixed in the gnome-screensaver, because besides expo there could be other applications that could receive those events... ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c12)  Danny Baumann    2008-12-19 18:12:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=561567#c11)) > thanks. > i only discovered that missing link after you asked. >  > it is great that expo is being fixed, but i am still wondering how it is > possible that expo gets access to mouse events in the first place. this is > still an issue that imho needs to be fixed in the gnome-screensaver, because > besides expo there could be other applications that could receive those > events...  Indeed. I checked today with KDE: expo is not usable with an active kscreensaver, even without having the latest fixes applied. This tells us that it _is_ possible to do it correctly.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: compiz-fusion-plugins-main

Reported upstream as <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=561567>

when the screensaver is active, expo mouse button shortcuts are still active. entering expo mode while the screensaver is up allows the user to click and drag the screensaver window and move it aside. the computer then becomes usable from behind the screensaver window, thereby making the "lock" feature of the screensaver quite useless.

this is using 8.10 with compiz-fusion-plugins-main 0.7.8-0ubuntu2

TEST CASE:

0. install compiz and compiz-config-settings-manager

1. run "ccsm" and go to the "expo" tab, then bind a mouse button to expo (e.g. <Shift>Button1)

2. lock screen

3. activate expo with the mouse button (shift-button1)

4. drag screensaver aside

5. steal coworker's private data

6. install update from -proposed

7. logout/login

8. repeat steps 2-4

9. verify that the window can no longer be dragged aside

Urgh. Not again.

I'm not sure whether the problem here is with gnome-screensaver failing to grab the mouse, or what, but this is a serious problem.

Urgh, I can confirm this behavior.

The "unredirect-fullscreen-window" option does not matter it works for both disabled and enabled.

The expo shortcut key does not work so at least this is not exploitable in the default install (we don't assign expo to a mousebutton by default). I looked at the screensaver code and it looks like there is a active pointer grab when the unlock dialog is up.

The critical bit is gs-manager.c:1106 - it releases the pointer grab when the dialog comes up and re-grabs it again when the dialog goes down. Its not held while the dialog is up, otherwise the button in the unlock dialog become unclickable. The keyboard grab is still held and the key events are forwarded to the dialog via forward\_key\_events() in gs-window-x11.c:1151.

I uploaded a initial version of a workaround fix. Its not elegant but should get the job done. I put it into the compiz PPA at:

"deb <http://ppa.launchpad.net/compiz/ubuntu> intrepid main"

version is 0.7.8-0ubuntu4.2~ppa1

Please test (both if it fixes the bug and for possible regressions/crashes) and give me feedback.

Thanks,

 Michael

hmm i'm not sure if this is related to your fix, but compiz has been segfaulting on my box. compiz crashes and gets replaced by metacity. then everything is fine until i do an alt+tab (in metacity) and suddenly X crashes. dmesg shows this line:

compiz.real[7849]: segfault at 1a0 ip 08069d8d sp bfa33fe0 error 4 in compiz.real[8048000+34000]

i'm not sure how to get any more info from it.

Hi,

I have 0.7.4-0ubuntu6 already installed from hardy-proposed. I guess, a version of 0.7.4-0ubuntu6.1 is needed.

sorry, i had fixed it by downgrading at the time, but then i forgot about it. now it seems like i'm running the latest version (0.7.8-0ubuntu2.1) and i no longer get random crashes. if it happens again, i'll post steps to reproducing the problem.

That fix doesn't prevent other windows to receive mouse events though.

## Breaking news

Compiz and Compiz Fusion are merging and are now known as Compiz.

As an immediate consequence, most Compiz Fusion websites are going to be moved in the upcoming days and weeks. Stay aware !

## What is Compiz Fusion ?

(taken from [AboutCompizFusion Wiki page](/wiki_subdomain/aboutcompizfusion.html))

Compiz Fusion is the result of a merge between the well-known Beryl composite window manager and Compiz Extras, a community set of improvements to the Compiz composite window manager. Compiz Fusion aims to provide an easy and fun-to-use windowed environment, allowing use of the graphics hardware to render each individual window and the entire screen, to provide some impressive effects, speed and usefulness. The first Compiz Fusion developer release was Compiz Fusion 0.5.2 on August 13th, shortly after Compiz 0.5.2 was released. First stable release of [Compiz Fusion is 0.6.0](/lists_subdomain/pipermail/community/2007-october/000142.html "Release Announcement") released on October 20.

Compiz Fusion is an open-source software project, meaning anyone can use it freely and contribute.

It is important to note that Compiz and Compiz Fusion are not the same thing (see: [Compiz Fusion Vs Compiz](/wiki_subdomain/compizfusionvscompiz.html)). There is close co-operation between the developers of Compiz and the developers of Compiz Fusion, though ; in fact, many Compiz Fusion developers are also Compiz developers.
