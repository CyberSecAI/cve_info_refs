Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in how `gnome-screensaver` and `compiz` interact. When the screensaver is active, it grabs the keyboard, but releases the mouse pointer grab when the unlock dialog is shown. This allows the `compiz` expo plugin to be activated by mouse actions, which then allows the user to interact with windows behind the screensaver. Specifically, the screensaver window was not treated as an override-redirect window by compiz, allowing it to be moved.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Inadequate Mouse Grab:** The screensaver releases the mouse grab while the unlock dialog is displayed, allowing other applications to receive mouse events.
*   **Lack of Filtering of Override-Redirect Windows:** Compiz expo plugin does not filter override-redirect windows.
*   **Insufficient Event Handling:** The screensaver does not effectively block mouse events from reaching other windows when locked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Bypass of Screensaver Lock:** Attackers can bypass the screensaver lock by activating the `compiz` expo plugin and moving the screensaver window.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Once the screensaver is bypassed, the attacker gains access to the user's desktop and data.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive information from the unlocked desktop.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers can perform actions as if they were the legitimate user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Mouse Button Shortcut:** The primary attack vector is triggering the `compiz` expo plugin via a user-configured mouse button shortcut while the screensaver is active.
*   **Window Manipulation:** After activating expo, the attacker moves the screensaver window to the side to access the underlying desktop.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Physical Access:** Attackers need physical access to the locked computer.
*   **`compiz` and Expo Plugin Enabled:** The `compiz` window manager and the expo plugin must be installed and enabled.
*   **Mouse Binding Configuration:**  The `compiz` expo plugin must be configured with a mouse binding shortcut.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The issue was identified in `gs-manager.c:1106` of `gnome-screensaver`, where the pointer grab is released temporarily.
*   The fix involved modifying `compiz` to prevent moving override-redirect windows when in expo mode.
*   A workaround was initially implemented in `compiz`, followed by a proper fix that prevents activation of expo mode while the screensaver is active.
*   The bug was present in multiple Ubuntu versions (Gutsy, Hardy, Intrepid, and Jaunty)
