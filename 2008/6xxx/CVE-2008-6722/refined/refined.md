Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of two issues:

1.  **Partial SSL Handshake:** After a user logs out of Novell Access Manager (NAM) using X.509 certificate authentication, the browser does not perform a full SSL handshake on subsequent requests. Instead, it sends a client hello with a cached SSL session ID, which the server still has reference to.
2.  **Tomcat SSL Cache Issue:** The Tomcat SSL server does not clear the cached SSL session entry upon user logout from the Identity Server. This allows a subsequent user on the same browser to reuse the previous user's session without re-authenticating.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Reuse:** A logged-out user's session can be hijacked by a different user without needing to re-authenticate if the browser window is not closed.
*   **Incomplete Logout:** The logout process does not fully invalidate the previous user's session due to the cached SSL information.
*   **Lack of SSL Cache Clearing:** The underlying Tomcat server does not provide an option to clear the cached SSL session upon logout.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the previous user's session and data by simply using the same browser window that the logged-out user had used previously.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker could potentially access sensitive information and resources available to the previous user.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the previous user has elevated privileges, the attacker could gain these privileges through the hijacked session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shared Workstation:** The attack vector involves a scenario where a user logs out of a NAM application using X.509 certificate authentication on a shared workstation, but leaves the browser window open. Another user then uses the same browser on the same machine before the session timeouts, to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Browser Caching:** Exploits the browser's caching of SSL session information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the workstation previously used by the logged-out user.
*   **No Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need the previous user's credentials or certificate.
*   **Timeliness:** The attacker must act before the session times out or the browser is closed.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects both Internet Explorer (IE) and Firefox browsers.
*   The issue is related to how the browser and the Tomcat server handle SSL sessions and caching.
*   A workaround is provided by injecting javascript into the logoutSuccess.jsp page which forces the user to close the browser, preventing the issue.
*   Clearing the browser's SSL cache is another workaround, though this is not automated.
