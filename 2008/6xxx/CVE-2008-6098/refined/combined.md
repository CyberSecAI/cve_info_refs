User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; da; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052912 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Bugzilla 3.0.4
After one of our developers were playing around with the quip system in our Bugzilla setup he figured out that he could unapprove all our quips by visiting a specially crafted URL.
For example: <http://bugs.example.org/quips.cgi?action=approve>
Our current quip setup is set to be 'moderated', but that doesn't change the outcome of the above URL.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit <http://bugs.example.org/quips.cgi?action=approve>
2. Wait for a Bugzilla admin to kill you.
Actual Results:
Unapproving all the quips in the database
Expected Results:
Show some access denied error or at least not unapprove all the quips :)
Perhaps it would be nice to create a group where the Bugzilla admins can put users in so that those users are allowed to approve bugs. But that's probably a feature request.

I can confirm this. The code in quips.cgi is crazy. If it gets action=approve and nothing else, it assumes you want to disable all quips, with no check at all about who you are.
I would say, the other way is more critical: when a powerless user adds a new quip with the param set to moderated, his quip is in the moderated queue till an admin approves it, and so the quip doesn't appear yet at the top of buglists. But with the trick above, and appending the ID of your quip to the URL, it gets approved by the attacker and now is visible at the top of buglists. And there is no log of who approved quips. As an attacker, I could put insults and have them approved.
We should leave this bug in the security group to prevent someone trying this on installations which use quips... and also because you can perform actions which are restricted to admins, which is generally bad.
Not blocking 3.2 RC1, but we should fix it in our next releases.Assignee: general → administrationStatus: UNCONFIRMED → NEWComponent: Bugzilla-General → AdministrationEver confirmed: trueFlags: blocking3.2+OS: Linux → AllHardware: PC → AllVersion: unspecified → 3.0.4

Attached patch

[Patch for quips security, against 2.22.x tree](attachment.cgi?id=333096&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=333096&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=449931&attachment=333096)

This patch is against the Bugzilla 2.22 branch used by Gentoo.
Should apply to other 2.x versions with a little bit of fuzz. 3.x might need a bit more template work.
quips.cgi rev 1.32

Nit: the param should be named 'defined\_quip\_$quipid' to better match what we do it in Bugzilla 3.2. Also, you don't need to define $quipe if you do the check directly inside if (...).

$form is now obsolete with my suggestion above.

Please modify this to match what we do now:

}

I know the code was already like this, but as we are here... :)

I didn't test your patch yet, but it looks great. Fix the comments above and we are all good.

"====" is the separator used between patch description and extra information, per LKML style. Most automatic tools should just strip it out.
This patch is against the 2.22.x branch used by Gentoo. Should apply to original 2.22 with a little bit of fuzz.
Against:
quips.cgi 1.32
template/en/default/list/quips.html.tmpl 1.16
The rest of your suggested changes are in place, and the fix does work on my production bugzilla.

You still have to define action == "approve" in user-error.html.tmpl, else you get:
"Sorry, you aren't a member of the 'admin' group, and so you are not authorized to quips."
Obviously, a verb is missing before 'quips'.

Nit: 'foo\_'.$bar could be written as "foo\_$bar". It's a bit nicer.

Both are integers. Should be != (ne is for strings).

Filtering is wrong at four places. Should be FILTER html (this has been fixed in Bugzilla 3.0 and 3.2). It doesn't harm as we pass an integer, but let's do it right anyway.
I tested your patch and it's working fine. It even applies on 3.2 RC1 without much changes (I just had to replace FILTER uri by FILTER html in the template above). We are very close to r+ now. :)

LpSolit:
I'm busy with real life too.
I think your demands of fixing the style of the quips code at the same time are not really what security issues are about. It should fix the security bug, and nothing but the security bug - which I did with the original submission, to the coding standards already present in that file.
A second patch submission to clean up the file to the nitpicking modern BugZilla standards that you've had me do gets put on top of it then. Patch isolation is a good thing, not a bad thing.
Regardless, I've attached a third take of the patch that fixes your other list of nitpicks.

quips-v3.patch (for 2.22)
Robin, sorry to bother you with my nits. We try to keep our code as clean as possible, even when fixing security bugs.
Anyway, this patch is working great, and I have no other nit to report. Thanks a lot for your contribution. r=LpSolit

Attached patch

[patch for 2.20](attachment.cgi?id=333587&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=333587&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=449931&attachment=333587)

On 2.20, $user is not defined in quips.cgi, so I had to replace it by Bugzilla->user. No other changes.

This one applies on all 3.x installations. The only difference is that the template already uses FILTER html, so there was a small bitrot.

Do we normally open security bugs as soon as the new version is released? If so, we should not do so with this one. Someone could cause havoc. We need to give people time to update.

Yes we do. It doesn't make sense to keep this one secret as the security advisory already contains details of the issue.

Does the security advisory give people enough information to exploit the issue?
If so, I would note that the Bugzilla team's approach to security bugs is different to the rest of the Mozilla project's. Normally, as I understand it, MFSAs do not include sufficient detail to exploit the issue, and bugs are not opened immediately upon the release of the patched version.
I think it might be a good idea to coordinate with Dan Veditz and ask him about project best practice, to make sure we are not putting Bugzilla admins at unnecessary risk.

There are much more critical security bugs than this one. To know what changed, all an attacker needs to do is to do a diff of the file, and it will appear very obviously how to build the URL to bypass checks. The fact that we (the Bugzilla team) do things differently from the rest of Mozilla projects is really not new. But this discussion has nothing to do in this bug.

<rant>
This bug really, really saddens me, for two reasons.
1. Robin's concerns in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=449931#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Unprivileged users can approve/unapprove all the quips (including bypassing moderation)") are perfectly valid. The BZ team is literally begging for contributions (I get asked every time I go to editparams), but when someone does contribute, they get needlessly nitpicked.
It would have taken you less time to clean up the patch than to enumerate all the nits.
2. As the admin of a large Bugzilla installation, I'm really glad I disabled quips long ago, because this afternoon's announcement would have had me scrambling to update. Of course "There are much more critical security bugs than this one" LpSolit, but this exploit is so trivially easy to action that you just know someone will try it..

That doesn't necessarily mean it's a good thing.

FYI, I backported the patch to all other branches myself. And in many cases, patch authors are happy to fix their own patches themselves (as I was when I started contributing, for instance). Also, I asked in [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=449931#c8 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Unprivileged users can approve/unapprove all the quips (including bypassing moderation)") if he wanted to update his patch himself. He could have answered 'no' and we would have done it ourselves.

So what?
> That doesn't necessarily mean it's a good thing.
Neither that's it's a bad thing. But we are completely out of the topic of this bug. There are forums for that.

> So what?
My lord... From your [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=449931#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Unprivileged users can approve/unapprove all the quips (including bypassing moderation)"), you seem to understand the severity of this issue. Have you no consideration for the admins of large sites who have responsibilities beyond patching Bugzilla the minute an advisory goes out? An advisory that reveals every detail about the exploit, no less, and even a way to inject insults, profanity and who knows what.
For some reason, [comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=449931#c17 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Unprivileged users can approve/unapprove all the quips (including bypassing moderation)") made a lot of common sense to me.
BTW: I'm not so sure we're off-topic here. This is a good indication of how the Bugzilla team goes about handling security advisories. I must say, this approach is far from great.

This is primarily a cosmetic feature, a successful exploitation will have no effect on your actual bug data. Regardless of that, figuring out how to exploit this bug is trivial. There is no way to announce that we fixed it without giving enough information for someone to figure out how to exploit. Yes, the fact that it exists is a black eye for us, as is any other security issue. In this case, because of the lack of sensitive data there, nobody ever really bothered to audit it (most folks seem to consider the quips feature to be a toy) aside from making sure you couldn't damage anything else from there.
The concern about the nitpicking has been discussed a number of times, and we're trying to work on it. We really do want to encourage outside contributions, and sometimes we need a good reminder like this. I do know that historically, the idea that a contributor should fix his/her own patches has come from the idea that we don't like to steal a contributor's thunder by winding up with people taking dual credit for a patch if someone else fixes it for them, and not by any means from a "we don't feel like doing the extra work" angle. It's often hard to convey that, or forgotten to be conveyed.
In defense of Fréderic, his responses often hint to me of language barrier issues. Although his command of English is quite good, it's not his primary language, and the connotation of some phrases he chooses to use often fail to convey the "I'm just making some suggestions here" and come off as a "you need to do this" more often than it should. I know him well enough to understand that's all he means, and usually don't even notice it, because when he really does mean "you need to do this" it's pretty darn explicit. But to someone coming in from the outside that hasn't dealt with him before it's certainly hard to know. [Comment #8](/show_bug.cgi?id=449931#c8 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Unprivileged users can approve/unapprove all the quips (including bypassing moderation)"), on review, does sound a bit condescending. It comes off with a feel of "We'll look badly upon you if you're not motivated anymore" which I'm sure isn't what he meant.

Regardless of the triviality of exploit of this particular case, I continue to assert that opening security bugs the moment we release patches and advisories is bad practice. Dave: where is the appropriate forum to have that discussion? The mailing list?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issue has been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Unprivileged users can approve/unapprove all quips

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Manipulation of Data
Affected:    2.17.4 and higher
Description: Quips, which are displayed at the top of bug lists, can be
             suggested by all users, but administrators can control which
             ones to display. By using a well crafted URL, unprivileged
             users can bypass access checks and approve or disapprove
             quips themselves.
