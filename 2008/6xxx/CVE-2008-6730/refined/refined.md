Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6730:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `usercheck.php` file of Flexphplink Pro version 0.0.7. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input used in the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `username` and `password` fields, an attacker can manipulate the SQL query to bypass authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the login authentication mechanism. This grants unauthorized access to the administrative panel of the Flexphplink Pro application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the application's admin login page (`/admin/index.php`).
- **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects SQL code such as `' or '1=1` into the username and password fields of the login form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application's login page.
- **Basic Knowledge:** Requires basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
