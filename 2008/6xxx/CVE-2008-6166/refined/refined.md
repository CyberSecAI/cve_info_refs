Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6166:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw present in the Kbase component for Joomla. This occurs due to insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter when requesting a specific article.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Malicious SQL code can be inserted through the `id` parameter of the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords (as shown in the provided exploit example).
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Depending on the database permissions, the attacker might also be able to modify or delete data, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the Joomla application and its underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable page of the Joomla component.
- **Manipulated URL Parameters:**  The `id` parameter within the URL is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Joomla site.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft SQL queries to exploit the injection point, but the provided example shows that this is not a particularly difficult injection.
- **No authentication is required** to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit example provided uses `UNION SELECT` statement to concatenate username and password from the `jos_users` table. This highlights how the attacker can directly extract sensitive data.
- The exploit targets Joomla component "Kbase (com_kbase)" version 1.2.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass normal access controls to extract sensitive database information and potentially gain further control over the system.
