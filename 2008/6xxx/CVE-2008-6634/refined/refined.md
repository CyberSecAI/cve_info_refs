Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6634:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is SQL injection vulnerabilities present in `resaopen.php` and `weekview.php` files of RoomPHPlanning 1.5. These vulnerabilities stem from directly using user-supplied input (`$_GET['idresa']` and `$_GET['idroom']`) within SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of input validation and sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure/Theft:**  An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords. The provided exploits demonstrate how to retrieve `LoginUs` and `PwdUs` from the `rp_user` table using `UNION SELECT` statements.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can allow attackers to modify or delete data, or even potentially gain control of the database server, leading to further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable PHP files (`resaopen.php` and `weekview.php`). The attacker manipulates the `idresa` and `idroom` parameters in the URL to inject malicious SQL code.
*   The exploit examples show the use of `UNION SELECT` to combine the results of the original query with the attacker's malicious query, which in this case is crafted to retrieve user credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or authenticated access initially, as the vulnerability is present in publicly accessible scripts.
*  Knowledge of SQL syntax is needed to craft the malicious payload.

**Exploit Examples:**

The provided exploits demonstrate how to extract user credentials:

*   `http://site.com/resaopen.php?idresa=-99999/**/union/**/select/**/1,2,3,4,5,6,concat(LoginUs,0x3a,char(58),PwdUs),8,9/**/from/**/rp_user/**/where/**/IdRk=1/*`
*   `http://site.com/weekview.php?idroom=-999/**/union/**/select/**/concat(LoginUs,0x3a,char(58),PwdUs),2,3/**/from/**/rp_user/**/where/**/IdRk=1/*`

These URLs inject SQL code to bypass the intended query logic and select sensitive data by appending a `UNION SELECT` clause.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit examples use the `concat()` function and `0x3a` and `char(58)` to concatenate the username and password with a colon separator, making the extracted data easier to interpret.
*   The `/**/` syntax is used as a comment to bypass basic filtering.
* The vulnerable parameters are `idresa` in `resaopen.php` and `idroom` in `weekview.php`.
