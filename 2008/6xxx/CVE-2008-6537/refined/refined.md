- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (`$_REQUEST['do']`). Although `$_GET['do']` is unset in certain conditions, the code uses `$_REQUEST['do']` later which can be manipulated by an attacker. This allows an attacker to access the setup page and retrieve the admin password hash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input sanitization, Hash disclosure
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve the administrator's password hash from the "setup" page, which can be used to compromise the application.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `LightNEasy.php` file with the `do` parameter set to `setup` (`LightNEasy.php?do=setup`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server hosting the LightNEasy application. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
