{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure cookie handling",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application sets cookies with administrative user and language information without proper security measures, allowing an attacker to manipulate these cookies.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain administrative access by setting the `COOKIE_LAST_ADMIN_USER` cookie to a valid administrator username and the `COOKIE_LAST_ADMIN_LANG` cookie to a valid language setting. This can lead to complete control of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is client-side manipulation of HTTP cookies.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to inject Javascript code into the browser to manipulate the cookies for the vulnerable site, or manually manipulate the cookies if the site can be accessed directly."
