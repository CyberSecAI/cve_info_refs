- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in multiple .asp files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - SQL Injection: The application is susceptible to SQL injection in multiple places, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.
  - Authentication Bypass: The application's login form can be bypassed using a simple 'or' 1=1 in both username and password fields.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database and potentially sensitive information, including usernames and passwords.
    - The attacker can bypass the administrator login and gain access to the administrative panel of the application.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - HTTP GET requests with manipulated parameters containing SQL injection payloads
    - Malformed login credentials
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    - No special privileges or access is needed.
- **Additional Details:**
    - The exploit uses `UNION SELECT` statements to extract data from the `tblyonetici` table (presumably a table containing administrator credentials).
    - The exploit provides specific vulnerable URLs including `kanal.asp`, `google.asp`, and `hakk.asp` under the `yonet` directory.
    - The exploit demonstrates an authentication bypass using `'or' 1=1` in the login form which allows direct access to the admin panel located at `/target/ShaderTV/yonet`.
    - The application is using an Access database.
