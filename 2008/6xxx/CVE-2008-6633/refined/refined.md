Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6633:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw.
*   It arises from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `idresa` parameter within the `resaopen.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the application's failure to validate or sanitize user-provided input before incorporating it into a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  The exploit example provided aims to extract user login credentials (`LoginUs` and `PwdUs`), possibly leading to authentication bypass.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database, although the provided exploit focuses on information retrieval.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `resaopen.php` script.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The `idresa` parameter in the URL is the entry point for the injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic Web Security Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious SQL query.
*  **No authentication is required** for the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
*   The exploit example uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve user credentials.
*   The affected application is RoomPHPlanning v1.5.
