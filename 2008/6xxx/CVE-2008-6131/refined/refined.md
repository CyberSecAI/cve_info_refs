Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in the advisory:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Directory Traversal:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `print.php` file's `page` parameter does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the inclusion of directory traversal sequences like "../../".
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation/sanitization on the `page` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can access arbitrary files outside of the web root and the current directory, potentially exposing sensitive information.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `page` parameter containing directory traversal sequences.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker can be remote and only needs to send a crafted HTTP request.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `index.php` file's `action` and `page` parameters are not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization before displaying data back to the user.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script code into a user's browser session within the context of the affected website. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking and phishing.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with malicious code in the `action` or `page` parameters.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker can be remote and only needs to send a crafted HTTP request.

3. **Session Fixation:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application allows the "PHPSESSID" parameter to be set to an arbitrary value by the user.
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not properly invalidate or regenerate session IDs, especially during authentication.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can set a session ID for a victim. When the victim logs in, the attacker can use the pre-defined session ID to impersonate the victim.
    *  **Attack Vector:** The attacker can inject a specific `PHPSESSID` value into the URL, and then convince a user to visit this URL.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker can be remote and needs to convince the victim to visit a crafted URL.

**Affected Product:**

*   moziloWiki version 1.0.1 and prior.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to moziloWiki version 1.0.2 or later, which includes fixes for these vulnerabilities.
