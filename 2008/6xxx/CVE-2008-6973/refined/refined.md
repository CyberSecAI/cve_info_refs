**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from the fact that when specific tracing is enabled in WebSphere Commerce, sensitive information is included in the trace logs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information is being written to log files when trace is enabled.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Potentially High Impact:** The exposure of sensitive information can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security compromises depending on the nature of the data.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker could potentially gain access to the sensitive data if they can:
    - Access the log files.
    - Know that the specific trace is enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Access to log files:** The attacker needs access to the file system or other means to read the log files where the sensitive information is being written.
-   **Knowledge of the specific trace being enabled:** The attacker would need to be aware that the trace with sensitive information is enabled.
