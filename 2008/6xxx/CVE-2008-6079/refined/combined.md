Severity: important

Hi,

the following CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) id was
published for imlib2, which is claimed fixed by upstream 1.4.2, which
is already in unstable. lenny is very likely affected, but I can't find
any actionable info, so you will need to touch base upstream to figure
this out.

[CVE-2008-6079](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-6079)[0]:
| Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in imlib2 before 1.4.2 have
| unknown impact and attack vectors.

If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the
CVE id in your changelog entry.

For further information see:

This is indeed fixed in 1.4.2. For lenny, yes it is affected and actually I
already identified and backported the fixes to the lenny version. This is
about multiple buffer overflows (heap and stack based) in various loaders. The
stable update will come today or tomorrow.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2029-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                                 Nico Golde
April 5th, 2010                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : imlib2
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 576469
CVE ID         : CVE-2008-6079

It was discovered that imlib2, a library to load and process several image
formats, did not properly process various image file types.
Several heap and stack based buffer overflows - partly due to integer
overflows - in the ARGB, BMP, JPEG, LBM, PNM, TGA and XPM loaders can
lead to the execution of arbitrary code via crafted image files.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.0-1.2+lenny1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.2-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.2-1.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
