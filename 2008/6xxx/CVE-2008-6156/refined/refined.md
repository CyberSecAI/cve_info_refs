Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6156:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `campaignId` parameter of the `editCampaign.php` script within the AdMan application.
*   **Weakness:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `campaignId` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
*  **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `editCampaign.php` script with a crafted `campaignId` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script. The exploit description suggests an attacker must be registered and logged into the web application before triggering the vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive data, including usernames and passwords from the `adman_users` table.
    *   **Potentially Full Database Control:** The SQL injection can potentially lead to further database access and manipulation.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit provided shows how an attacker can craft a malicious `campaignId` parameter using a SQL `UNION SELECT` statement to concatenate the `password` and `username` fields from the `adman_users` table.
The provided URL demonstrates a successful injection:
```
www.site.me/editCampaign.php?campaignId=-2'+union+select+concat(password,0x3a,username)+from+adman_users/*
```
This crafted URL bypasses the expected input to the vulnerable SQL query and injects malicious SQL code allowing for the extraction of credentials.
The exploit uses the following SQL Injection payload:
`'-2'+union+select+concat(password,0x3a,username)+from+adman_users/*`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Exploit-DB entry indicates the affected application is "AdMan 1.1.20070907".
*   The vulnerability is specific to web applications using PHP.
* The exploit was verified by Exploit-DB.
* A live demo of the exploit was provided by the author on the `formfields.com` domain.
