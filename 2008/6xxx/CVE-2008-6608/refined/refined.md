Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the DevelopItEasy Events Calendar version 1.2. This is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, specifically in the `calendar_details.php` script.
- **Authentication Bypass:** It is also vulnerable to an authentication bypass, potentially through SQL injection in the admin login.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive database information, including usernames and passwords, by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The authentication bypass allows an attacker to gain administrative access to the application.
- **Complete Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through manipulating the `id` parameter in the `calendar_details.php` URL.
- **Login Form Manipulation:** Exploiting the admin login form with SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft injection payloads.
- **No Authentication Required initially:** The initial SQL injection in `calendar_details.php` does not require any prior authentication.

**Details from Exploit-DB entry:**

-   The exploit is detailed for `calendar_details.php` using a crafted id parameter:
`www.site.me/calendar_details.php?id=-26+union+select+0,0,concat(user_name,0x3a,user_pass),0,0,0,0,0,0,0+from+login--`
-   The administrator login is vulnerable to SQL injection using the payload  `' or '1=1--`  in both username and password fields: `user : cyb3r-1st ' or ' 1=1--` and `pass : cyb3r-1st ' or ' 1=1--`

This exploit allows the attacker to bypass authentication.

The Exploit-DB entry provides concrete examples of exploitation, including the specific vulnerable URL and SQL injection payloads, offering more detail than a basic CVE description.
