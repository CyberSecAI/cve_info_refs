Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `det` parameter of the `bukutamu.php` file, leading to SQL injection.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize the input provided through the `det` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including user credentials (username and password).
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to `bukutamu.php`, using the vulnerable `det` parameter.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and has knowledge of the vulnerable parameter.

The provided exploit example demonstrates how an attacker can use a crafted `det` parameter to perform a UNION SELECT SQL injection to retrieve usernames and passwords from the 'user' table.
