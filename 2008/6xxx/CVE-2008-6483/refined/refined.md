Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6483:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue. The `admin.googlebase.php` file within the VirtueMart Google Base component includes another file using a path derived from user input (`$mosConfig_absolute_path`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes a file from a user-controlled location via the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the user-supplied path, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file hosted on a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify data, or cause other malicious actions depending on the code they include.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET parameter:** The `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter is passed as a GET parameter within the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable path:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable file.
- **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs to have a web server where they can host a malicious PHP file that will be included by the vulnerable server.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable file is: `administrator/components/com_googlebase/admin.googlebase.php`
- The vulnerable code snippet is: `include( $mosConfig_absolute_path.'/administrator/components/com_virtuemart/virtuemart.cfg.php' );`
- The exploit URL format is: `http://localhost/[path]/administrator/components/com_googlebase/admin.googlebase.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=[evilcode]`
