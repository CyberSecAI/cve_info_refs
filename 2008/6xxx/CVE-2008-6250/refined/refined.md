Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6250:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization for the `arcmonth` parameter in Comdev Web Blogger's blog page. The application fails to validate user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `arcmonth` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data theft:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords (including the admin account).
- **System access:** The vulnerability can lead to unauthorized system access, as attackers can potentially obtain credentials for administrative accounts

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable blog page. The `arcmonth` parameter is used to inject malicious SQL code

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without prior authentication. The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Magic quotes off:** The exploit requires that the `magic_quotes` setting in PHP is turned off. If `magic_quotes` is enabled, the injection will be escaped, making the attack unsuccessful.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit-db entry provides specific URLs for demonstration purposes.
- The exploit includes a union based SQL injection attack to retrieve username and password information.
- The entry includes a google dork to identify vulnerable instances
- The entry notes the timeline of discovery and vendor contact
- It provides recommendations for remediation by both sanitizing user input and by enabling magic quotes.
