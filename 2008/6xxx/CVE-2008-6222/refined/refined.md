Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6222

**Vulnerable Software:** Joomla! Component ProDesk versions 1.0 and 1.2

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The ProDesk component for Joomla! does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `include_file` parameter. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary local file path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI): The vulnerability allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, which can reveal sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, which could lead to further compromise.
- Potential for more severe attacks: Depending on the server's configuration and the files available, a skilled attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by including malicious files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: An attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes the `include_file` parameter with a path to the desired local file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Joomla! installation.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, it can be exploited remotely.
- Basic knowledge of URL construction is needed.

**Exploit Example:**
```
http://site.com/index.php?option=com_pro_desk&include_file=../../../../../../etc/passwd
```
This example shows how an attacker can use directory traversal to access the `/etc/passwd` file.
