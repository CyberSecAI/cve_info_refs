- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A design error in Crysis causes the game to append internal network information to disconnect and error packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure vulnerability. The game leaks internal log information within disconnect and error packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain sensitive information including: IP addresses, nicknames, client status (allowing for targeted disconnection via spoofed packets), PunkBuster details (paths, screenshots, bans, checks, player GUIDs), Gamespy SDK status, and other real-time network logs of both clients and servers.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specific packets (e.g. a keyexchange packet without a prior join packet) that trigger error responses. This can be done remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server or client.
