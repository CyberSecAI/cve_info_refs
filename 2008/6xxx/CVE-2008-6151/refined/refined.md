- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization when handling the `ID` parameter in the `shpdetails.asp` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability exists.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and extract sensitive information such as usernames and passwords from the database.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `ID` parameter in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Details:**
The provided exploit shows how to use a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection to retrieve usernames and passwords from the administrators table.
The vulnerable URL is `http://localhost/shopmall/shpdetails.asp?ID=1`.
By injecting SQL code into the ID parameter such as `1 union select 0,1,2,username,password,5,6,7,8,9 from administrators`, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database.
The exploit also points out the location of the admin login page, which is `http://localhost/shopmall/admlogin.asp?`, that can be used after exploiting the SQLi vulnerability.
