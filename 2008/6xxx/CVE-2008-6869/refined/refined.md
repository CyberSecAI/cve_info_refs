      "content": "The provided content describes a remote configuration file disclosure vulnerability in OraMon 2.0.1.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of proper access control, allowing direct access to the configuration file, 'oramon.ini'.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Configuration file disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the 'oramon.ini' configuration file which may contain sensitive information.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Information disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information, such as database credentials ($USERID, $PASSWORD, $DATABASE) stored in the configuration file. This information could then be used to gain unauthorized access to the database.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Direct URL access:**  An attacker can directly request the configuration file using its URL, which in this case is `www.site.com/path/config/oramon.ini`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable OraMon application.\n- **Knowledge of file location:** The attacker must know or guess the path to the `oramon.ini` file, which is typically located within the webroot of the application.",
