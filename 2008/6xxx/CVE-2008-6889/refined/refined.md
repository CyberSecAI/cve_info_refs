{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection due to insecure handling of the 'AccountID' parameter in the `Merchantsadd.asp` page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by injecting SQL queries. The blind nature means that the attacker cannot directly see the output but must infer information based on the server's response to true or false conditions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is present in the `Merchantsadd.asp` page which is accessible through HTTP requests. The `AccountID` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable page and analyze the server's response."
