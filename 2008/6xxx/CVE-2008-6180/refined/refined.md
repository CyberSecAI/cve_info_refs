Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure cookie handling and a SQL injection flaw in the `checkLogin` function within the `system/nlb_user.class.php` file of NewLife Blogger version 3.0 and earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application relies on a cookie (`nlb3`) containing the user ID and an MD5 hash of the password. The cookie is formatted as `nlb3=iduser::md5 pass`. The application directly uses the user ID from the cookie in a SQL query, without sanitization.
*   **SQL Injection:** The user ID extracted from the cookie is directly injected into an SQL query within the `checkLogin` function. This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can perform SQL injection attacks by crafting a malicious cookie.
*   The provided examples demonstrate a "blind" SQL injection method, where the attacker can infer whether a condition is true or false based on whether the application considers the user to be logged in or not.
*   This allows the attacker to extract information from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker must modify the `nlb3` cookie value in the user's browser. This can be achieved using JavaScript or browser extensions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the cookie sent by the browser to the vulnerable web application. No special access or privileges are required initially.
*   The attacker can be remote.
