Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `catid` parameter of the `choosecard.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information disclosure: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords.
- Potential for further compromise: Depending on the database permissions, an attacker might be able to modify or delete data, or potentially gain access to the underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `choosecard.php` script. The `catid` parameter is manipulated with SQL code.
- Specifically, the exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to concatenate the username and password fields from the `admin` table.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- Knowledge of SQL: The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft a working injection payload.

**Additional details:**
- The provided exploit examples demonstrate how to extract the username and password of the admin user.
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.01 and 1.02 of the web application.
- The vulnerable URLs are:
  - `http://webbdomain.com/php/postcarden/choosecard.php?catid=`
  - `http://webbdomain.com/php/postcardir/choosecard.php?catid=`
- The application uses PHP.
