{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the insecure SQL query construction within the admin login functionality of ProQuiz 1.0. Specifically, the application directly incorporates user-supplied input (username and password) into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization or parameterized queries.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the admin authentication and gain unauthorized access to the administrative interface, potentially allowing them to modify or delete data, control the application, or escalate privileges further.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface of the ProQuiz 1.0 application, specifically the admin login page located at /[path]/admin/index.php.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the admin login page and have the capability to craft HTTP requests. No special positioning is required; the attack is performed over the web."
