How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Flash authoring tools create Flash files that contain cross-site scripting vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#249337

Original Release Date: 2008-01-02 | Last Revised: 2008-06-16

---

### Overview

A number of authoring tools for Flash content may generate files that contain cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Any site hosting Flash generated by an affected tool could be vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

### Description

| [ActionScript](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript/) is a scripting language based on [ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) (also referred to as JavaScript) used primarily for the development of websites and software using Adobe Flash. The resulting Flash content is typically published in the form of SWF files embedded in web pages. ActionScript within a Flash file creates dynamic content on the web and interacts with web browsers in a manner similar to JavaScript, VBScript, and other client-side scripting languages. As with traditional script content in HTML pages, improperly validated user-controlled input in Flash files can execute arbitrary ActionScript and JavaScript in the context of the domain hosting the affected Flash file. One specific type of vulnerability depends on the behavior of a special ActionScript protocol called asfunction. The asfunction protocol is used for URLs in HTML text fields and causes a link to invoke an ActionScript function in a Flash file instead of opening a URL. An attacker could call all public and static functions by supplying a string parameter to asfunction. There exist other types of vulnerabilities as well.  Applications that generate Flash files (e.g., "save as SWF", "export to SWF", etc.) by using vulnerable templates or by including static Flash content like a controller may automatically insert generic and vulnerable ActionScript into saved files. As a result, all Flash files generated by these affected applications create cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the domains hosting these files. Furthermore, exploitation of these vulnerabilities would be consistent across all sites using a particular product and vulnerable sites could be identified through a web search. |

### Impact

| Any website hosting Flash files generated by an affected product is vulnerable to cross-site scripting in the context of the domain hosting the vulnerable file. Secondary impacts include the ability to spoof or modify web content, access website information such as cookies, or retrieve data from an encrypted HTTPS connection. For a more detailed description of the impact of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, please see [CERT Advisory CA-2000-02](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html#impact). |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or apply an update or patch**Updates for affected authoring tools have been released to address this issue. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more information. Note that this section is not complete, vendors that create vulnerable Flash authoring tools may not be listed.Vulnerable Flash files must be regenerated after the affected authoring tools have been updated.Adobe has included mitigations in Flash Player to block attacks against some cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in Flash files ([APSB07-20](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb07-20.html)). |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**Until patches can be applied and affected Flash files regenerated, website owners may wish to remove automatically generated Flash files or at least serve automatically generated Flash files from "safe" domains, such as numbered IP addresses.Developers of applications that save to SWF are encouraged to perform proper input validation on all user definable variables used in URL loading ActionScript functions and the htmlText variable. Specifically,     + Whitelist protocol handlers to allow only "http:" and "https:" in all URL loading functions. + Whitelist characters in user definable input when used in getURL(). Do not rely on escape(). When feasible, only allow alphanumeric characters. + Whitelist and/or HTML entity encode user input in htmlText. + Load SWF files from relative URLs. The relative URL should not contain "..". |
