```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The 2Wire DSL routers drop the DSL connection when a request is made to the `/xslt` endpoint with a `page` parameter containing a non-alphanumeric character preceded by a percent sign (`%`).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper input validation or handling of special characters in the `page` parameter of the `/xslt` endpoint.
- Impact of exploitation: Denial of Service (DoS) causing the DSL connection to drop, thus disrupting network connectivity for affected users.
- Attack vectors: Sending crafted HTTP requests to the `/xslt` endpoint of the router with a vulnerable `page` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router, which could be done by being on the same network as the router or through a remote network if the router is exposed.
