{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the username field before using it in an SQL query, allowing for SQL injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain administrator access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the login form, specifically the username input field.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the login form of the vulnerable application. The attacker does not require any prior authentication, and can achieve admin access by using a specific SQL injection payload in the username field."
