{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user input in the 'change.php' script when updating user profiles.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL injection vulnerability",
	"Arbitrary Add Admin"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious code into the form fields, escalating their privileges to administrator level. This allows them to access the administrative control panel and perform unauthorized actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to 'change.php' with SQL injection payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have a user account on the vulnerable system and be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target server."
