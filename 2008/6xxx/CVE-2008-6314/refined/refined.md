  "Impact": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by exploiting the blind SQL injection vulnerability. This is demonstrated by the provided exploit code that extracts the user's password hash.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the 'tag_board.php' script, specifically when handling the 'delete' action within the control panel. The 'id' parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpBB instance. They do not necessarily need to be logged in to exploit this vulnerability as demonstrated in the provided exploit code."
