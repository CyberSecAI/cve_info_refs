Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `index.php` file of the Mumbo Jumbo Media OP4 application. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application doesn't directly display database error messages or query results. The attacker relies on observing differences in the server's response (in this case, whether the page exists or not) based on the injected SQL conditions.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The application does not sanitize or validate the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as:
    *   Administrator usernames (`kennung` field from `op4_admin` table)
    *   Administrator password hashes (`passwort` field from `op4_admin` table).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `index.php` file. The malicious SQL code is embedded within the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the injection payloads.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable parameter `id` and the application's behaviour.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses blind SQL injection techniques by constructing SQL queries within the 'id' parameter of the URL and observing the presence/absence of the "Die angeforderte Seite existiert nicht" string in the response to determine whether the injected conditions are true or false.
*   The exploit code automates the process of extracting the administrator's username and password hash character by character, using ASCII value comparisons.
*   The exploit requires command line arguments of: Target URL, Page ID and Admin ID.

**Additional Notes**

* The exploit code provided is in PHP.
* The exploit targets a specific application: Mumbo Jumbo Media OP4.
* The exploit leverages the fact that the vulnerable application does not return an error message when the injected code is invalid. It just fails to return a page that can be used to determine if the query resulted in a true or false result.
