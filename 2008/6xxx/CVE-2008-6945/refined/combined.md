What's new in each version of Interchange
(in development since the version 5.6 branch)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See UPGRADE document for a list of incompatible changes.
Interchange 5.7.7 released on 2011-06-12.
Core
----
\* Ensure users were always assigned sessions when using major
browsers, regardless of any toolbar matches in the User Agent
string.
\* If we are running an or search and not all of the specs have equivelant sql
specs (WHERE clauses) then don't try to optimize the query as doing so will
cause records to not be returned that might match other specs.
\* Allow customization of "DO ANOTHER" HTML block in the table editor. The DO
ANOTHER block contains hard-coded text and return-pages used for radio buttons
which is always displayed for new entries. This change allows customized HTML
to replace it for when you want to use the table editor in your own custom
admin pages.
\* Strip bad characters from affiliate source. These characters cause problems
in the usertrack log (and possibly other places) if they are allowed to remain
in the source.
\* Remove newline from errormessages to be able to parse locale of it
\* Fix a bug in the [read-cookie] tag which in very specific rare
circumstances could return the wrong value for a cookie.
\* Fix a bug in parsing of TemplateDir directive with multiple directories
on a single line (RT#318).
Thanks to Mat Jones for the report.
\* Fix for processing GDBM files while using UTF8.
\* Add additional UserDB encryption options.
\* Add pragma handling for setting the Cache-Control header.
\* Enhance TrustProxy to handle multiple chained proxies.
\* Multiple bugfixes to payment modules.
\* Fixes when sending UTF-8 email.
Tags
----
\* Allow sorting of forum entries.
Standard Demo
-------------
\* Fix for adding items to cart with options shows expired page message. Thanks
to Steve Graham .
\* Fix for country selection drop down.
Thanks to Paul Jordan .
\* Fix for state selection drop down for Ireland.
Thanks to Paul Jordan .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interchange 5.7.6 released on 2010-03-23.
Core
----
\* Fix a "HTTP Response Splitting" security exploit. This is not known
to be exploitable in the standard demo, but could potentially affect
other pages in rare circumstances.
\* Fix a bug in initialization of Vend::Payment::BusinessOnlinePayment
supplemental parameters.
\* Fix a bug in css.tag to properly output the css when using the
inline

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
