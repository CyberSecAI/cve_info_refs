# Security Vulnerabilities

## WebWork 1 Parameter Injection Hole

#### Severity

Atlassian rates this vulnerability as **CRITICAL**, according to the scale published in the [JIRA Security documentation](/jira/security-advisories-112853939.html#SecurityAdvisories-SeverityLevels). This scale allows us to rank a vulnerability as critical, high, moderate or low.

#### Risk Assessment

We have identified and fixed a security flaw which may affect JIRA instances in a public environment. This flaw is a parameter injection vulnerability in the implementation of the [WebWork 1](http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork_old/) web application framework in JIRA. The Webwork 1 web application framework allows for the dynamic transformation of URL parameters into method calls. This potentially allows a malicious user (hacker) to call exposed public methods in JIRA via specially formatted URLs.

Atlassian recommends that you upgrade to [JIRA 3.13.2](/jira/jira-3-13-2-release-notes-171180103.html) to fix the vulnerabilities described below.

#### Risk Mitigation

We **strongly recommend** that you upgrade or apply the necessary patch as soon as possible. If you judge it necessary, you can disable public access (i.e. anonymous access and public signup) to your JIRA system. For even tighter control, you could restrict JIRA access to trusted groups only.

#### Vulnerability

All versions of JIRA are vulnerable to this security flaw.

A number of public JIRA methods are exposed to this vulnerability. These methods can be called via specially formatted URLs. The method names are not listed for security reasons.

#### Fix

The fix is to process parameters via a trusted implementation of the action factory in the Webwork 1 web application framework, which provides more secure method transformations.

This issue has been fixed in [JIRA 3.13.2](/jira/jira-3-13-2-release-notes-171180103.html) or later. The fix is also provided as a patch for JIRA 3.12.3, 3.11, 3.10.2, 3.9.3, 3.8.1, 3.7.4, 3.6.5 and 3.5.3. There are no patches available for JIRA versions 3.4.x or earlier. We recommend that you upgrade to at least JIRA 3.5.x to apply this patch.
