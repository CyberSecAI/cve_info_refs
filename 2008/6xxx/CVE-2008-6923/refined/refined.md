Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the Joomla! component `com_content`. The component fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `Itemid` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into database queries.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, specifically in the `Itemid` parameter, leading to SQL injection.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can use SQL injection to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data (e.g., usernames and passwords stored in the `jos_users` table), and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database and the web application.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is via the `Itemid` parameter in a crafted URL.
        Example URL: `http://localhost/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=60&Itemid={SQL}`
    *   A successful exploit involves injecting SQL code within the `Itemid` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web application.
    *   No specific access is required; this is a remote vulnerability that can be exploited over the network by crafting a URL.
    *   The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter and be able to construct valid SQL queries.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit example demonstrates the extraction of usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table, indicating that the vulnerability can be leveraged to compromise user accounts.
*   The vulnerable version of the Joomla! component is 1.0.0 as specified in the title.
*   The exploit is from 2008, suggesting the vulnerability was publicly known and exploitable at that time.
