- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure cookie handling. The application uses a cookie named `admin_access` to determine if a user has administrator privileges. This cookie is not properly protected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application relies on a client-side controlled cookie for authentication. The cookie is vulnerable to tampering.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain administrative access by setting the `admin_access` cookie to `1`.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by injecting a javascript snippet that sets the `admin_access` cookie to '1'. This javascript can be injected through various means like the browser's developer console or a malicious web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute javascript in the context of the vulnerable application.
