The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in Social Engine 2.7 and prior:

**1. SQL Injection:**

*   **Root cause:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `comment_secure` POST variable within `profile_comments.php`. This unsanitized input is then directly used in a SQL query.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization before using the `comment_secure` parameter in SQL queries.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion of database content.
*  **Attack vectors:** Sending a malicious POST request with the `comment_secure` variable to the `profile_comments.php` script
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**2. CRLF Injection:**

*   **Root cause:** The `PHPSESSID` cookie variable is not properly sanitized before being used in a manner that allows for the injection of arbitrary custom headers using carriage return line feed characters (CRLF).
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of the `PHPSESSID` cookie variable, which allows for CRLF injection.
*  **Impact**: The vulnerability allows for the injection of arbitrary custom headers
*   **Attack vectors:**  Manipulating the `PHPSESSID` cookie value to include CRLF sequences.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker must be able to set or modify cookies.

The advisory recommends using `htmlspecialchars()` or `htmlentities()` for HTML tag sanitization, and `mysql_real_escape_string()` for SQL injection prevention. It also mentions the use of `magic_quotes`, while cautioning against double escaping.
