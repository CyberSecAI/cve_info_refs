{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the insecure storage of the database file `cldb.mdb` in a publicly accessible directory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Database disclosure vulnerability. The database file is accessible directly through a web request.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain access to the database contents, potentially containing sensitive information such as user credentials, personal data, and application configuration. This can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and further compromise of the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a direct HTTP request to the location of the database file: http://localhost/[PATH]/db/cldb.mdb",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know the path to the database file and must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server."
