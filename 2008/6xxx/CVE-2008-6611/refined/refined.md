  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-6611",
      "root_cause": "The application suffers from an SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input in the 'id' parameter.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection",
         "Arbitrary File Upload",
         "Authentication Bypass"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data modification, or data exfiltration. Additionally, arbitrary file uploads can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. An authentication bypass can give admin access to unauthenticated users.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request with malicious SQL in the 'id' parameter in index.php",
         "HTTP POST request with a malicious file to admin/uploader.php",
        "Accessing admin/uploader.php grants admin privileges to unauthenticated users"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication or special capabilities are required for the file upload or authentication bypass vulnerabilities.",
       "additional_info": "The application 'minimal-ablog 0.4' is vulnerable to SQL Injection, Arbitrary File Upload and Authentication Bypass. The SQL injection vulnerability is located in the index.php file through the 'id' parameter. The arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in the admin/uploader.php file. Authentication bypass is possible when accessing admin/uploader.php without previous admin authentication."
