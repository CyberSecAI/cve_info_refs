Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6077

**Vulnerable Software:** LoudBlog 0.8.0a

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The `ajax.php` file in LoudBlog is vulnerable to SQL injection. The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `colpick`, `rowpick`, `rowval`, `table`, and `action` parameters when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the provided exploit shows how these parameters can be crafted to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database. This can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:**  The attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords of users.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete data in the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** By injecting SQL to modify user roles and permissions, an attacker could gain unauthorized administrative access to the application.
    *   **Complete System Takeover:** In some cases,  if the database user has sufficient privileges the attacker could potentially gain control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/loudblog/ajax.php` file.
    *   **Parameters:** The exploit uses the following parameters to inject SQL code:
        *   `colpick`: Used to specify the column for the query. Modified with `concat` to extract username and password.
        *  `rowpick`: Specifies the row selector for the query, set to id.
        *   `rowval`: Specifies the value for the row selector.
        *   `table`: Specifies the table, in this case `authors`.
        * `action`: Specifies the action type, in this case `singleread`.
    *  **Authentication Bypass:** The exploit requires an authenticated user, however the SQL injection itself bypasses the intended access controls. 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable LoudBlog application.
    *   **Valid User Account:** The exploit requires a valid username and password for the LoudBlog application, regardless of permissions. The exploit uses this valid user account to form the required `lbauth` cookie, which is used by the server to authenticate the request before processing it further.

**Exploit Details:** The exploit provided is a Perl script that demonstrates how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.  It takes as command line arguments the URI, admin ID, valid username and password, and then crafts and sends the malicious HTTP POST request to extract user credentials.

This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, providing a clear understanding of how to exploit the vulnerability.
