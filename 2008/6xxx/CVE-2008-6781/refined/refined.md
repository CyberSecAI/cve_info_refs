Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `cat_id` parameter within the `directory.php` file of the SFS EZ Gaming Directory application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is SQL injection. By manipulating the `cat_id` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration (accessing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, emails etc.)
    *   Data modification or deletion
    *   Complete database compromise
    *   Potential for further attacks on the system/server via the database server

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `directory.php` file. The vulnerable parameter is `cat_id`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote and does not need any prior access to the server or application.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and how to manipulate URL parameters.
*   **SQL knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to construct a working SQL injection payload.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit examples show how to inject SQL code using `UNION SELECT` statements to extract database information:
    *   `http://localHost/gaming/directory.php?ax=list&l=list_by&cat_id=[exploit]`
    *   `http://www.turnkeyzone.com/demos/gaming/directory.php?ax=list&l=list_by&cat_id=1/**/union/**/all/**/select/**/1,2,concat_ws(0x3a,password,email),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13/**/from/**/links/*`
    *   `SITE.COM/[path]/directory.php?ax=list&sub=1&cat_id=1+union+select+0,1,version(),database()/*`
