{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `download.php` script in Extract Website allows for arbitrary file inclusion due to insufficient sanitization of the `filename` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive information such as configuration files or system files.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `filename` parameter in the HTTP GET request to the `download.php` script, an attacker can specify the path to any file on the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application, and has no special access or privileges on the server. They must know the path to the vulnerable script."
