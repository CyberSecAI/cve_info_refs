**General Details:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerabilities exist in third-party TYPO3 extensions due to insecure coding practices.
*   **Weaknesses:** The extensions contain weaknesses such as XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:
    *   XSS: Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   SQL Injection: Allows attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data breaches or modification.
    *   Information Disclosure: Can expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
*   **Attack vectors:**  The attack vectors vary depending on the specific vulnerability. XSS attacks can typically be performed by injecting malicious code into user inputs or through manipulating URL parameters, while SQL injection occurs when an attacker can manipulate the SQL queries the web application sends to the backend database.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to identify vulnerable versions of the extensions being used. For XSS, the attacker might need to use some social engineering to make users click a crafted link or use a vulnerable entry point, while for SQL injection the attacker could manipulate input fields or crafted URLs.

The bulletin emphasizes that these are third-party extensions and not part of the core TYPO3 system and the extension authors are responsible for security fixes.
