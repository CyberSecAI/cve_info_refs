Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability was caused by a regression in the `system-tools-backends` package, specifically in the "Users and Groups" tool. When changing passwords or creating new users, the tool incorrectly used 3DES hashing instead of the correct MD5 hashing. This occurred because the system-tools-backends was scanning PAM configurations for the word "md5" and fell back to 3DES when it did not find it. The system had switched to "sha512", causing the fallback to 3DES.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Password Hashing:** The primary weakness was the use of 3DES hashing, a weaker hashing algorithm compared to MD5. This made stored user passwords more vulnerable to cracking.
*   **Incorrect Algorithm Selection:** The tool's logic for choosing the hashing algorithm was flawed. It was relying on a string search for "md5" in PAM configurations, instead of using PAM correctly to determine the correct algorithm.
*   **Password Truncation:**  The issue also manifested as a password truncation. When 3DES was used, only the first 8 characters of the password were used for the hash. This allowed login using only first 8 characters of the actual password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised User Accounts:**  Attackers could more easily crack user passwords due to the weaker 3DES hashing.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** If an attacker obtained a truncated password hash (first 8 characters), they could gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If an administrator account was affected, the impact could include full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** Attackers could exploit this by creating new users or changing passwords via the "Users and Groups" tool.
*   **Compromised System:** An attacker with access to the system's `/etc/shadow` file might be able to take advantage of the weaker hashing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User with access to the "Users and Groups" tool**: Any user who has access to the "Users and Groups" tool, or any other tool that utilizes the affected backend, could create a user with the truncated and weaker hash.
*   **Access to /etc/shadow:** An attacker with read access to the /etc/shadow file, could potentially use the weak hash for password cracking purposes.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug was a regression, as older versions used the correct MD5 hashing.
*   The issue was present in Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex).
*   The fix involved patching the `system-tools-backends` package to use MD5 when the system uses SHA password hashes, to avoid the use of 3DES.
*   The long-term solution would be to use PAM to determine the hashing algorithm.
*   The bug report indicates that the issue was also related to a vulnerability (bug 51551) in how `liboobs` handled password hashing which was also incorrectly falling back to 3DES when SHA was used.
