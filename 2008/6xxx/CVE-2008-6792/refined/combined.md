# USN-663-1: system-tools-backends regression

5 November 2008

system-tools-backends regression

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)

## Packages

* [system-tools-backends](/security/cves?package=system-tools-backends) -

## Details

It was discovered that passwords changed (or new users created) via the

"Users and Groups" tool were created with 3DES hashing. This reduced the

security of stored user passwords, and was a regression from the correct

MD5 hashing. This update fixes the problem; future password changes

will correct the hashing used. We apologize for the inconvenience.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [system-tools-backends](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/system-tools-backends)
  -
  [2.6.0-1ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/system-tools-backends/2.6.0-1ubuntu1.1)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

I use "Intrepid" beta with latest updates and I've found out accidentally, that if in GNOME login screen or in gnome-terminal (for su command) or at tty[1-6] screens enough to input only 8 chars of correct password - in that case authorization will be successful. For example, if I have password for my account, which contains 25 symbols, then if I input only 8 first symbols of my password at GNOME login screen, login will be successful. The same occurs in gnome-terminal for su command - to get super user's privileges, enough input only 8 chars.

Besides, I check it at "Hardy" - here everything ok - it's necessary to input full password correctly for pass authorization.

I don't sure, but maybe only I have this problem. So, it's be very intresting, if someone else check this and reports about it.

To try reproduce this bug, follow next steps:

1. run users-admin utility;

2. press "Unlock" button and type your password;

3. press "Add User" button;

4. type in username's field "example" and in password's field "verylongpassword"

5. select in Profile's field "Administrator"

6. in advanced settings select in Main group's field "users"

7. press OK button and log out

8. at gdm screen type "example" as login and "verylong" as password

9. after that authorization should be successful

BTW, adding user via adduser utility (from terminal) requests full input of password.

Some notice - looks like users-admin utility adding hash for only first 8 chars of password in /etc/shadow.

So, to fix this issue I've replaced hash for my user account in /etc/shadow - I've copied this hash from hardy's /etc/shadow - there is everything ok.

Also, I've found out, that file /etc/pam.d/common-password can contains "max=N" string, where N - number of significant chars of password; but in intrepid, as in hardy, there is no such string.

Please, someone, just try to reproduce this and add some feedback here; I just would like to know does anybody else have this issue.

I guess the reason is that g-s-t still uses 3des/md5 passwords, while adduser now defaults to using sha256 passwords.

system-tools-backends is scanning PAM configs specifically for the word "md5". Since we switched to "sha512", it falls back to 3DES. See [bug 51551](/bugs/51551) for more details.

Hi,

Here is a suggested patch for Intrepid.

It makes system-tools-backends use md5 if the system uses a sha

for passwords. While not ideal it is at least better than 3DES.

For Jaunty we need to improve this somehow so that sha512 is used.

Thanks,

James

Hi Milan,

This would be good to take upstream at minimum. Moving

away from a binary MD5/3DES choice would be better. Moving

to PAM would be better still, as you get this for free and there

is no danger of it getting out of date again and causing a similar

issue.

Thanks,

James

I don't really understand how it's working currently. Is Ubuntu using SHA? If so, is liboobs writing MD5 passwords to /etc/shadow?

We should at least support SHA as well as MD5. I plan to make a release before Karmic so that a few bugfixes go into it. Do you think you could improve the patch before that?

Using PAM is of course much cleaner and logical, but we need to find a way to send the clear password to the backends, and that won't be done before Karmic. An intermediate fix would be Kees's patch [1] to use chpasswd, but upstreaming it is difficult since we have to be sure chpasswd is present, or use the stb for that. So maybe it would be worth fixing the problem once for all using PAM, instead of spending time on temporary fixes.

We have a ready-to-use perl code if we want to use PAM in the stb at [2]. But before that we need to send the clear password...

The current patches in Ubuntu use chpasswd to determine the hashing (i.e.

it is not something stb should have knowledge of).

But, as you say, that requires a patched chpasswd, so it's totally

unacceptable for upstreaming. :(

That's what the patch in this bug does. Kees implemented a better

solution for us which gave us encryption of the same strength as

default.

Writing MD5 is better than 3DES, but should still be avoided.

Well, the patch is fine as far as it goes. The main thing to add would

be SHA support.

I would like to see the default be for the strongest that stb knows

about, so that when the switch is made next time the unkown scheme

translates to SHA512 being used, rather than 3DES again.

I think that would be good, but as you say it's not straightforward.

Creating the pipe and passing the password over isn't too much work. I

think it will require changing the D-Bus interface though.

Thanks,

James
