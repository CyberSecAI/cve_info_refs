      "cve": "CVE-2008-6911",
      "content": "The provided content from Exploit-DB describes an exploit for BrewBlogger 2.1.0.1 that allows an attacker to add an arbitrary user with administrator privileges. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation, specifically in the `logincheck.inc.php` and `process.php` files. The exploit leverages an SQL injection vulnerability in the login mechanism to bypass authentication, followed by an arbitrary user addition through a crafted POST request to `process.php`. The `magic_quotes_gpc` setting must be off for the SQL injection to work.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: Lack of input validation in the login and user addition processes\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection and arbitrary user addition.\n\nImpact of exploitation: An attacker can gain full administrative control of the BrewBlogger application by adding a new admin user.\n\nAttack vectors: The vulnerability is exploitable through web requests targeting the application's login and user management functionality.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable BrewBlogger application.",
      "additional_details": "The exploit script demonstrates the entire attack process. It first performs SQL injection to bypass the login and gain access to the administrative functionality. Following that, it creates a new administrative user with credentials specified in the arguments.",
