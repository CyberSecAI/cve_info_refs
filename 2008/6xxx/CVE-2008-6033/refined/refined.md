  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `comments.php` script in WSN Links 2.20 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration (e.g., user credentials), data modification, or complete database compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by crafting malicious SQL queries via the `id` parameter in the `comments.php` script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and manipulate the `id` parameter. No prior authentication or special network position is needed."
