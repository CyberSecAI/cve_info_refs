Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `members.php` script in ScriptsEz Mini Hosting Panel is vulnerable to local file inclusion (LFI). This occurs because the script doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `p` and `dir` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary local files via the `p` and `dir` parameters.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The script fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `p` and `dir` parameters, allowing attackers to manipulate the file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can read any file accessible to the web server user.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information such as configuration files (e.g., `conf.php`), system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), or application source code.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Knowledge gained from exposed files can be leveraged to conduct further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to `members.php`, providing manipulated values for `p` and `dir`.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `p` and `dir` parameters in the URL to point to the file they wish to include.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to construct an HTTP GET request with query string parameters.
*   **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the filesystem to effectively target sensitive files, such as those containing configuration or password data.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `members.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** `act=view`, `p=[FILE]`, `dir=[DIR]`
*   **Example Exploit URLs:**
    *   `/members.php?act=view&p=passwd&dir=../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/` (reads `/etc/passwd`)
    *   `/members.php?act=view&p=conf.php&dir=/test/../../..` (reads `conf.php` relative to the /test directory, traversing up from there)
*   **Live Demo Links**: The content includes links to a live demo, further confirming the vulnerability.
