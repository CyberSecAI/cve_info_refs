```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control on the `CfgOptUser` configuration page of the Destar application. This allows unauthenticated users to add new user accounts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insufficient access control",
    "Arbitrary user creation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can create new administrative user accounts on the vulnerable Destar application, gaining complete control over the system.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/config/add/CfgOptUser` endpoint with user creation parameters."
  ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests to the target Destar application. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
