Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6117:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from exploit-db.com explicitly mentions "CVE: 2008-6117" and provides details about a blind SQL injection vulnerability. This confirms that the content relates to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection flaw in the `poll_view_id` parameter of the `homepage.php` script within the "PG Job Site" application.
*   **Weakness:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `poll_view_id` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*  **Vulnerability:**  Blind SQL injection vulnerability
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by injecting SQL queries.
    *   The "blind" nature of the SQL injection means the attacker does not get direct feedback on their queries, they will need to infer results based on application responses.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `homepage.php` with a malicious value in the `poll_view_id` parameter.
    *   Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered through the `action=results` parameter along with the vulnerable `poll_view_id` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   No authentication or prior access seems to be required to trigger the vulnerability. However, the exploit examples mention needing to be logged in to view the exploited content of the page.

**3. Technical Details from Exploit-DB:**

*   The exploit examples provided by Exploit-DB demonstrate how to test for the blind SQL injection by injecting SQL queries to check the database version `@@version`.
    *   `http://www.jobsoftpro.com/demo/homepage.php?action=results&poll_ident=6&poll_view_id=6+and+substring(@@version,1,1)=4` (true)
    *   `http://www.jobsoftpro.com/demo/homepage.php?action=results&poll_ident=6&poll_view_id=6+and+substring(@@version,1,1)=5` (false)
*   The provided URL indicates the vulnerable application is named "PG Job Site". The vulnerable script is `homepage.php`.
* The exploit was discovered by "ZoRLu".
* The affected platform is PHP.

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The other content from vupen.com and secunia.com is unrelated to this CVE. They are either placeholder pages or marketing content from security companies.

**In summary:** The exploit-db.com content provides a clear description of a blind SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2008-6117) in the `poll_view_id` parameter of the `homepage.php` script of "PG Job Site". This vulnerability allows an attacker to extract sensitive database information.
