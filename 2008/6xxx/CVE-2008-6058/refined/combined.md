# Syslserve Changelog

**Version 1.06 (6 december 2008)**

* Fixed: Security update, all versions prior to this one have a remote denial-of-service vulnerability.

**Version 1.059 (22 August 2008)**

* Fixed: Last character was missing of the output path.

**Version 1.058 (20 August 2008)**

* Fixed: Commandline -od option couldn't handle directories contain spaces.
* Fixed: Xml settings file wasn't working correctly for port/directory/raw/output screen.

**Version 1.056 (11 July 2008)**

* Added: Memory check if 80% of the psychical memory is in use, syslserve will be dropping messages. This is added because
  windows will otherwise just stop to program if the memory is full.
* Added: Now using Tinyxml instead of my own xml parsing.
* Added: It's now possible to define groups of IP's in the config file. Non defined devices(based on ip) are still stored under
  that ip in their own directory.
* Changed: My 90days period with VS2008 was expired so i moved the whole project files to CodeBlocks, a free C++ IDE. This also means it's now compiled with
  a different compiler namely: gcc (GCC) 3.4.5 (mingw-vista special)

**Version 1.055 (21 June 2008)**

* Added: It's possible to use Config.xml to put the settings in. No new settings added yet. See example: [config.xml](config.html)

**Version 1.054 (18 June 2008 )**

* Fixed: Probably fixed the deref list error. I could produce the error with earlier version, but with this version i couldn't
  stress it enough to receive the error. Moved the pop\_front to just after the front() into the same CS

**Version 1.053 (16 June 2008 )**

* Fixed: the linebreak when the -r option is enabled.

**Version 1.052 (16 June 2008 )**

* Removed: the dll from wpcap from linker settings, it was for very future features.
* Changed: File writing code changed again.

**Version 1.051 (15 June 2008 )**

* Fixed: Probable fix to the periodical file write, when slow incoming messages, seem the cause of breaking the given file limit.
* Added two batch files, to remove and install syslserve as a service. Edit installservice.bat to run it with certain parameters.

**Version 1.05 (14 June 2008 )**

* Fixed, Daily compressing of the logfiles, it broke after the introduction of log files per device.
* Fixed, The raw option
* Removed / disabled some new features that slowed performance down between the 1.04 and 1.05 unreleased versions.
* Tested: ***syslserve -r -fs 5000 -od C:\output\*** , It should really work ;) , Tested with my own syslog stressor at 10 Mbit/s

**Version 1.04 (16 March 2008 )**

* - Size call is very slow on a list, so i removed it everywhere where i was using it.
* - Added a mutex on the list between the write thread and the message receive thread.
* - I always used stat lib in c++ to deterime the file size, but this part seems slow or somehow the operating system is not updating the file size in realtime. This is one of the causes that filesizes differ sometimes alot and go beyond the max file size given. Now i replaced this part by a counter and this never fails.
* - Multithreading added to syslserve, i've done some first testing with it and it drops less to even none messages. It buffers now to memory until an minute has past since last write or if the max file size has been reached.
* - Syslserve now seperates the log files by source IP. For every incoming message there is a directory created with the given output directory.
* - Fixed, Buffer overrun of message size.
* - Fixed, opendir problem, opendir is more compat in linux , now using also the windows related functions, it will now be possible to run on one station and have the logs on the other.

**Version 1.03 (29 July 2007 )**

* Refactor version, code moved around in this version without adding any new features. This to be able to add new features easier.

**Version 1.02 (22 July 2007 )**
In this version i've started making it possible for the user to set some more options than that were firstly available. The following options are added.

* -r When used, syslserve won't output an csv file but just the log messages that are received.
* -fs  This will set the maximum size of a log file part. By default it will be ~ 10 Mib. The files size is given in Kib.
* -od  With this option it's possible to set the output directory. Thus where the log files are stored, by default it will be the directory where syslserve is running.
* -p  With this option you can set the listening port. By default it is UDP 514

**Version 1.01 (21 July 2007 )**

I encountered trough own experience that syslogs can become very big. Therefore in this version i started to implement features so handling big syslogs will go smoother. Any ideas on doing this even better please send to sysutilgp@gmail.com

* - Log files are splitted automatically in pieces of ~10 Mib, the sizes can be different since syslserve won't cut received messages in half. The log files are named: Log..csv
* - At the end of the day count will be reset to 0 and yesterday will be compressed using zlib compression. The uncompressed files will be deleted and the compressed files will be named: Log..csv.gz
* - At the moment log files will be stored , where syslserve is located. If the server is downed and later on started again, it will find either the latest log file of that day or if there aren't any logs available that day, it will start at 0, and going from there.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
