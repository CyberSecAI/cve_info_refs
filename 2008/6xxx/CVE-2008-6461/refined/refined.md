The provided content is a security bulletin for TYPO3, specifically **TYPO3-20080919-1**, and directly relates to the specified CVE. The bulletin details multiple vulnerabilities found in several third-party TYPO3 extensions. Here is a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause across many of the listed extensions is the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities. Some extensions also suffer from arbitrary code execution and information disclosure issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple extensions (autobeuser, cgswigmore, dmaddredit, h\_book, mw\_random\_objects, myquizpoll, pd\_churchsearch, ste\_prayer2, wrg\_anotherbelogin) are vulnerable to SQL Injection. This vulnerability type allows an attacker to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data breaches or modifications.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Some extensions (h\_book, pd\_churchsearch, wrg\_anotherbelogin) specifically have blind SQL injection vulnerabilities, making it harder for the attacker to get immediate feedback but still allowing data exfiltration.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The `kw_secdir` extension is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to execute code on the server.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `file_list` extension has an information disclosure vulnerability that could reveal sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities varies:

*   **SQL Injection:** Could lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data within the database. This could compromise user accounts, application data, or other sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Could lead to data exfiltration of database records.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Complete compromise of the server by allowing an attacker to run malicious code.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Unauthorized viewing of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors involve exploiting vulnerable parameters or input fields within the mentioned third-party extensions that are used to generate SQL queries or handle file access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to identify a website using a vulnerable version of one of the listed TYPO3 extensions and then craft malicious requests that exploit the identified weaknesses. No information on attacker privilege level is given, so it is assumed that no special privileges are required if the extension is publicly accessible.

**Specific Extension Details:**

The following extensions and their vulnerabilities are detailed in the bulletin:

*   **autobeuser (auto BE User Registration):** SQL Injection. Vulnerable versions: 0.0.2 and below. Solution: uninstall and delete the extension.
*   **cgswigmore (Swigmore institute):** SQL Injection. Vulnerable versions: 0.1.1 and below. Solution: Update to 0.1.2 or later.
*   **dmaddredit (FE address edit for tt\_address & direct mail):** SQL Injection. Vulnerable versions: 0.4.0 and below. Solution: Uninstall and delete the extension.

*   **mw\_random\_objects (Simple Random Objects):** SQL Injection. Vulnerable versions: 1.0.3 and below. Solution: Uninstall and delete the extension.
*   **myquizpoll (My quiz and poll):** SQL Injection. Vulnerable versions: 0.1.3 and below. Solution: Update to 0.1.4 or later.
*   **pd\_churchsearch (Diocese of Portsmouth Church Search):** Blind SQL Injection. Vulnerable versions: 0.2.10 and below. Solution: Update to 0.1.1.
*    **ste\_prayer2 (Random Prayer Version 2):** SQL Injection. Vulnerable versions: 0.0.2 and below. Solution: Update to 0.0.3 or later.
*   **wrg\_anotherbelogin (Another Backend Login):** Blind SQL Injection. Vulnerable versions: 0.0.3 and below. Solution: Update to 0.0.4 or later.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bulletin is a "Collective Security Bulletin" (CSB), which is used for less critical or less widely used extensions to reduce workload on the security team.
*   The bulletin recommends that users uninstall and delete extensions when there is no available update or if the extension is no longer maintained.
*   Users are encouraged to subscribe to the typo3-announce mailing list for future security bulletins.
