```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a value from the `lang` parameter to include a language file. This is done without proper sanitization, allowing for local file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can modify the `lang` parameter in the URL or the `firstlang` cookie to specify a path to a file on the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and control the `lang` parameter or the `firstlang` cookie."
