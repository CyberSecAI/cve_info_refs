Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6002:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `sendfile.php` script of webcp version 0.5.7. The `filelocation` parameter, intended to specify the file to be sent, is directly used in a `fopen()` function without validation.
*   **Weakness:** The primary vulnerability is a **Remote File Disclosure (RFD)** vulnerability. The application allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path via the `filelocation` parameter.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that the web server user has access to. This can include sensitive configuration files (e.g., `config.inc.php` as shown in the proof of concept), source code, database credentials, and other potentially sensitive data.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `sendfile.php` script and including the vulnerable `filelocation` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker requires no authentication and can send HTTP requests to the web server. No special privileges on the target system are needed other than network connectivity to the server and knowledge of the vulnerable URL.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet highlights the direct usage of the `filelocation` parameter:

```php
if ($tf = fopen($filelocation, "r")) {
  // Date in the past
}
```

*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by accessing the configuration file:
    `http://gyrbo.madoka.be/web-cp/sendfile.php?filelocation=config.inc.php`
*   The exploit code is based on the fact that the application directly reads and returns the contents of the file specified by the `filelocation` variable

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is in the webcp application, specifically version 0.5.7, which is a PHP-based application.
*   The exploit was originally published on milw0rm.com, which is a now-defunct website.

**Summary**

CVE-2008-6002 is a remote file disclosure vulnerability in webcp 0.5.7, where an attacker can read arbitrary files by manipulating the `filelocation` parameter in `sendfile.php`. This allows attackers to potentially expose sensitive information by reading the contents of files on the server, like the configuration files.
