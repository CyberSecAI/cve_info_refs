Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-6855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insecure cookie handling in Absolute News Feed 1.0. The application improperly trusts and uses the value of the "xlaAFSuser" cookie, which is set by the client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the contents of the `xlaAFSuser` cookie, making it susceptible to manipulation by an attacker.
- **Authentication Bypass:** By crafting a specific cookie value (`xlaAFSuser=p=admin`), an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain administrative access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Administrative Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized administrative privileges to the vulnerable application.
- **Complete Compromise of Application:** With administrative access, the attacker can potentially modify application settings, create or delete content, and perform any other action that an administrator is authorized to do, potentially resulting in a complete compromise of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Client-Side Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `xlaAFSuser` cookie value on the client-side (e.g., using JavaScript).
- **HTTP Request:** The modified cookie is sent to the server in subsequent HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of basic web technologies, specifically how cookies function and how to manipulate them.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to interact with the web application.
- **No Credentials Required:** No valid login credentials are required to perform the attack, the attacker directly exploits the insecure cookie handling.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit code is a JavaScript snippet: `javascript:document.cookie="xlaAFSuser=p=admin";`. This demonstrates that an attacker can inject this code into a browser's address bar or elsewhere to modify the cookie on their end before making requests.
- The exploit instructions provided in the content indicates that after setting the manipulated cookie, the attacker can then gain access by navigating to `http://www.xigla.com/absolutenf/demo/menu.aspx`.
