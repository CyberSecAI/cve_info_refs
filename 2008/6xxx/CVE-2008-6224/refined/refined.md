  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes a local file inclusion vulnerability in `visualizza.php` due to the insecure use of `require_once` with user-controlled input from the `plancia` GET parameter. It also has a remote file inclusion vulnerability in `crea.php` due to a similar insecure use of `require_once` with user-controlled input from the `plancia` GET parameter.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially exposing sensitive information like `/etc/passwd` or execute arbitrary code through inclusion of remote files.",
    "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `plancia` GET parameter in `visualizza.php` to include local files, or in `crea.php` to include remote files.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application."
