How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : libpng
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2445 CVE-2007-5269 CVE-2008-1382 CVE-2008-5907 CVE-2008-6218 CVE-2009-0040
Debian Bug     : 446308 476669 516256 512665

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in libpng, a library for
reading and writing PNG files. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

The png_handle_tRNS function allows attackers to cause a denial of
service (application crash) via a grayscale PNG image with a bad tRNS
chunk CRC value. (CVE-2007-2445)

Certain chunk handlers allow attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) via crafted pCAL, sCAL, tEXt, iTXt, and ztXT chunking in PNG
images, which trigger out-of-bounds read operations. (CVE-2007-5269)

libpng allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a PNG file with zero
length "unknown" chunks, which trigger an access of uninitialized
memory. (CVE-2008-1382)

The png_check_keyword might allow context-dependent attackers to set the
value of an arbitrary memory location to zero via vectors involving
creation of crafted PNG files with keywords. (CVE-2008-5907)

A memory leak in the png_handle_tEXt function allows context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) via a crafted
PNG file. (CVE-2008-6218)

libpng allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PNG
file that triggers a free of an uninitialized pointer in (1) the
png_read_png function, (2) pCAL chunk handling, or (3) setup of 16-bit
gamma tables. (CVE-2009-0040)

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version1.2.15~beta5-1+etch2.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.27-2+lenny2.  (Only CVE-2008-5907, CVE-2008-5907 and
CVE-2009-0040 affect the stable distribution.)

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.35-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# libpng: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200903-28**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in libpng, which might result in the
execution of arbitrary code

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libpng** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.35** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.35** |

### Background

libpng is the official PNG reference library used to read, write and
manipulate PNG images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libpng:

* A
  memory leak bug was reported in png\_handle\_tEXt(), a function that is
  used while reading PNG images (CVE-2008-6218).
* A memory
  overwrite bug was reported by Jon Foster in png\_check\_keyword(), caused
  by writing overlong keywords to a PNG file (CVE-2008-5907).
* A
  memory corruption issue, caused by an incorrect handling of an out of
  memory condition has been reported by Tavis Ormandy of the Google
  Security Team. That vulnerability affects direct uses of
  png\_read\_png(), pCAL chunk and 16-bit gamma table handling
  (CVE-2009-0040).

### Impact

A remote attacker may execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user opening a specially crafted PNG file by exploiting the erroneous
out-of-memory handling. An attacker may also exploit the
png\_check\_keyword() error to set arbitrary memory locations to 0, if
the application allows overlong, user-controlled keywords when writing
PNG files. The png\_handle\_tEXT() vulnerability may be exploited by an
attacker to potentially consume all memory on a users system when a
specially crafted PNG file is opened.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libpng users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.35"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
