Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the improper handling of user-supplied data within the `sendfmt()` function of the SMT kernel (Simple Multi Threading kernel), which is used by the Xitami web server. Specifically, the `sendfmt()` function passes user-controlled strings directly to `vsnprintf()` or `vsprintf()` without proper sanitization. These functions are susceptible to format string vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **LRWP Request Processing Format String:**
    *   A format string vulnerability exists when processing LRWP (Long Running Web Process) requests.
    *   User-supplied data from the `tcb->rtr->name` variable (which is part of the request from a peer process) is passed directly to the logging function `sendfmt()`, which then uses `vsnprintf()` or `vsprintf()`.
    *   This allows an attacker to inject format string specifiers.

2.  **Server Side Includes (SSI) Request Processing Format String:**
    *   A format string vulnerability exists when processing Server Side Includes (SSI) requests.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered within the logging mechanism of SSI requests.
    *   By requesting a crafted URL, an attacker can inject format string specifiers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is the ability to crash the Xitami server, causing a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The format string vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **LRWP:**
    *   An attacker sends a specially crafted request to the LRWP service, which listens on TCP port 81 by default. The malicious payload is included in the request destined for the peer process and is logged by the server.
    *   The format string is included within a string that is part of the LRWP communication protocol, and is then used in the logging functionality of Xitami.
    *   Example payloads: `"%s*100" + "\xFF" + "somestring" + "\xFF"` or `"%n" + "\xFF" + "somestring" + "\xFF"`

2.  **SSI:**
    *   An attacker visits two specially crafted URLs in sequence to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   First a request like `http://localhost/%25n.ssi` and then `http://localhost/testssi.ssi`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send network requests to the target Xitami server.
*   For LRWP, the attacker sends packets to port 81. For SSI requests, access to port 80 is needed.
*   The attacker doesn't require any prior authentication or special access to the server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities are located in the SMT kernel, which is a separate iMatix product that Xitami uses. The vulnerability is not directly within the Xitami code but is due to how the `sendfmt()` function is used.
*   The Xitami project is abandoned. The vendor advised to make the information available via their wiki.
*   The provided exploit PoC code targets the LRWP vulnerability.
