**Security Advisory B013** - Xitami Web Server v2.5c2 Multiple Vulnerabilities

**==================**

**Release Date:** April 3 2008

**Impact:** A remote user can cause a Denial of Service and possibly execute arbitrary code on a target computer running Xitami Web Server v2.5c2

**Vendor URL:** http://www.xitami.com/

**Vulnerable Versions:** Tested on v2.5c2 for Windows, other versions are probably vulnerable as well.

**Description:**

Xitami Web Server is a small, fast, and powerful multiplatform Open Source Web Server.

Multiple format string vulnerabilities have been found in xitami.
These vulnerabilities exist because of the way xitami uses the SMT kernel (Simple Multi Threading kernel - another iMatix product): some user supplied data is directly passed to the vsnprintf() and vsprintf() functions inside the sendfmt() function of the SMT kernel.

**1st vulnerability:** LRWP Request Processing Format String

Begining with version 2.2a, Xitami includes a persistent CGI extension called LRWP (Long Running Web Process).
LRWP is written as a WSX agent which implements a simple protocol for communicating with external processes called Peers.
The peer process simply waits for the requests to come from Xitami and then responds with a valid http response, just like a CGI program.

A format string vulnerability exists in Xitami's code that logs the LRWP requests. This vulnerability may permit an attacker to execute arbitrary code, or at least cause a DoS attack, on a target machine running a vulnerable version of Xitami Web Server.

The format string can be triggered by sending a special request to the service (which listens by default on TCP port 81) in the form of:
```
    "%s*100" + "\xFF" + "somestring" + "\xFF"
```
another example:
```
    "%n" + "\xFF" + "somestring" + "\xFF"
```

A PoC exploit has been released at http://www.bratax.be/

As mentioned before, this bug is not actually located in xitami, but is caused by the way that xitami uses the vendor's "SMT kernel".

If we look at the source code we can see that xitami calls the sendfmt(); function in xilrwp.c:

```

    /* Log peer connection */
    sendfmt(&operq, "INFO",
            LRWP_NAME ": Peer %s connected for %s host",
                tcb->rtr->name, tcb->rtr->vhost);

```

Inside sendfmt();, the user controlled string (tcb->rtr->name) will be passed to vsnprintf() or vsprintf(), allowing a malicious user to provide his own format strings:

```

    #if (defined (DOES_SNPRINTF))
        vsnprintf (formatted, 4096, format, argptr);
    #else
        vsprintf  (formatted, format, argptr);
    #endif

```

**2nd vulnerability:** Server Side Includes (SSI) Request Processing Format String

SSI is a simple server-side scripting language used almost exclusively for the web.

Xitami provides a standard SSI filter and, by default, recognises any document with extension '.ssi', '.shtm', or '.shtml' as an SSI document.

A format string vulnerability exists in Xitami's code that logs the SSI requests. This vulnerability may permit an attacker to execute arbitrary code, or at least cause a DoS attack, on a target machine running a vulnerable version of Xitami Web Server.

The format string can be triggered by visiting the following 2 URL's after each other on the web server (which listens by default on TCP port 80):
```

http://localhost/%25n.ssi
http://localhost/testssi.ssi

```

**Solution:**

A possible solution is to put some input validation on the data before calling sendfmt();

Another solution is changing sendfmt(); itself.

**Status:**

Initial vendor contact: Sunday, March 30, 2008.

Initial vendor response: Monday, March 31, 2008.

As the xitami project is abandoned, the vendor asked to make this information available to xitami users via the vendor's wiki.

Public release: Wednesday, April 3, 2008.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
