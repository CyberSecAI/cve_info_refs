{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses user-supplied input from the GET parameters 'a' (user ID), 'b' (email), and 'c' (new password) to construct a SQL query to update a user's password. The query is vulnerable because it uses the LIKE operator with the email parameter, allowing an attacker to bypass the email check by using the '%' wildcard.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection, specifically a flawed password reset mechanism using a wildcard bypass.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can change any user's password by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability in the password reset functionality.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests targeting the 'init_pass2.php' script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know the user ID, and be able to send a crafted GET request to the vulnerable script."
