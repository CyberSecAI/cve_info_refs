Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6142

**Vulnerable Software:** Flexphpic 0.0.4 & Flexphpic Pro 0.0.3

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `usercheck.php` file within the admin directory of Flexphpic. The SQL query used for authentication is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$checkuser`, `$checkpass`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting SQL code into the username and password fields, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the administrator panel.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the login form of the web application's admin panel (`/admin/index.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web application's login page.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker should understand basic web concepts and SQL syntax.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable SQL query in `admin/usercheck.php` is:
```sql
$sql = "select username,adminid from linkexadmin where username='$checkuser' and password='$checkpass'";
```
An attacker can bypass authentication by entering the following SQL injection payload in the username and password fields:
`' or '1=1`

This payload modifies the query to:
```sql
select username,adminid from linkexadmin where username='' or '1=1' and password='' or '1=1'
```
The `1=1` condition always evaluates to true, thus bypassing the password check and granting access.
