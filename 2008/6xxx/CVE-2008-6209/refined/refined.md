- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `cat_id` parameter of the `view_product.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as administrator usernames and passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the `cat_id` parameter in the URL, an attacker can inject malicious SQL queries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
