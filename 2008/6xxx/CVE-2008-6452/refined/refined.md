Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `show_vote.php` script. The `id` parameter, which is likely used in an SQL query, is not validated allowing for SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. This occurs because user-supplied input is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, hashed passwords, and other potentially sensitive information.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** In some scenarios, SQL injection can be used to modify data, escalate privileges, or even gain command execution capabilities on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `show_vote.php`, specifically manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payloads.
- **Understanding of Application:** The attacker would benefit from an understanding of the application's database structure and query patterns.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit examples provided illustrate how to leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve user credentials by using `UNION SELECT` statements to bypass the original query and extract data from the `users` table.

*   `http://www.site.com/dir/show_vote.php?id=-1+union+select+user_id,fname,3,4+from+users`: This payload is used to retrieve `user_id` and `fname` (first name) fields from the users table.
*   `http://www.site.com/dir/show_vote.php?id=-1+union+select+1,hashed_pw,3,4+from+users`: This payload is used to retrieve hashed passwords (`hashed_pw`) from the users table.

The exploit uses `-1` to cause the original query to return no results, then a `UNION SELECT` is used to append the attacker's query.
