The provided content is related to CVE-2008-6390.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by an SQL injection vulnerability in the authentication process of Ocean12 Membership Manager Pro.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the authentication mechanism. Specifically, the username field is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authentication bypass: By injecting SQL code into the username field, an attacker can bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP request: The attacker crafts a malicious login request to the application's authentication form.
- Malicious username: The primary vector is injecting SQL code into the username field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- Knowledge of SQL injection: The attacker must understand how to construct a valid SQL injection payload to bypass authentication.
- No prior authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit involves using the following credentials:
-   username: `admin ' or ' 1=1`
-   password: `Cyber-Zone or any thing you want :)`
This input bypasses the login mechanism. The provided SQL injection payload bypasses the application's authentication logic, allowing anyone to gain administrative access without a legitimate password.
