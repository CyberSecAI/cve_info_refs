The provided content is related to CVE-2008-6529.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Living Local 1.1" web application, specifically when handling image uploads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The application allows users to upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP scripts, by bypassing file type checks or by not having proper file type validation
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS, which may be used to trick users into executing arbitrary JavaScript code. The provided demo URL shows XSS vulnerability: `http://www.jerseyads.net/listtest.php?r="><script>alert()</script>`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP script (shell), an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.
- **Compromise of Server:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the server.
- **XSS Attack:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users to steal cookies, redirect users or perform other actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the "Living Local 1.1" application.
- **File Upload Functionality:** Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the image upload functionality within the user account settings ("editimage.php").

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to register to the site as a user or have valid credentials.
- The attacker needs to have a malicious PHP script ready for upload.
- The attacker needs to navigate to the image upload functionality within their profile settings, upload a malicious PHP file and then execute this file by right-clicking on the logo and opening the properties of the image.
