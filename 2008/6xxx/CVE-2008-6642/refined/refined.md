Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-6642:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw present in the `view.php` file of FluentCMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`sid` parameter) before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive database information (user data, configurations, etc.) by injecting SQL queries that bypass authentication or reveal data.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** With sufficient privileges or if the application is poorly secured an attacker can modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Server-Side Attack:** Although not explicitly stated in this document, it is possible with full database access that the attacker can inject malicious code into the database that can be used later as a server-side attack

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `view.php` file, manipulating the `sid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable FluentCMS server.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft a working SQL injection payload.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit examples show how to use `UNION SELECT` statements to retrieve information such as database version, user, and database name.
*   The provided exploit payloads utilize `unhex(hex())` to bypass potential filtering, which may be basic filtering on SQL keywords or other similar sanitization techniques
*   The exploit strings indicate a lack of proper input validation on the `sid` parameter.

**Summary:**

The content provides an example of how an SQL Injection vulnerability in FluentCMS's view.php can be exploited. An attacker can use the sid parameter to inject arbitrary SQL statements. The impact of this vulnerability ranges from information disclosure to potentially full control of the server.
