**Summary of Vulnerabilities and Impact**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** (air_filemanager) Could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*  **SQL Injection:** (cooluri, dmmjobcontrol, pd_calendar_today, pd_trainingcourses, sb_downloader, ste_prayer, timtab_sociable, toto, worldcup) Could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete data in the database.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (dcdgooglemap, dmmjobcontrol, tjs_reslib, worldcup) Could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **External Setting Manipulation:** (nd_antispam) Could allow an attacker to modify settings, potentially leading to other exploits.

**Attack Vectors**

*   The attack vectors vary depending on the vulnerability type.
*   SQL Injection attacks typically involve manipulating input fields to execute malicious SQL queries.
*   XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into input fields, which are then rendered in the browsers of other users.
*   Arbitrary code execution would involve exploiting a flaw to execute commands directly on the web server.
*   External setting manipulation would involve abusing a lack of validation to change settings to gain access or exploit the site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   The attacker would typically need to be able to interact with the vulnerable web application, either directly or through another vector like a malicious link.
*   For SQL injection, they need to find an injection point (usually through user input).
*   For XSS, they need to inject malicious scripts through user input or another way that gets stored or displayed by the web application.
*   For Arbitrary code execution, they require a method to upload or execute a script on the server.
*   For External Setting Manipulation, they need to find an external setting that is not properly validated.

The bulletin emphasizes that these vulnerabilities are in third-party extensions and not part of the core TYPO3 installation. It also recommends following the TYPO3 Security Guide and subscribing to the typo3-announce mailing list for future security bulletins.
