While the initial display of the project name has some limitations, the edit link `/manageproject.php?action=editform&id=<projectId>` displays the project name without any restrictions, allowing for complete exploitation. This requires administrator authentication.",

While directly accessing this URL shows an error, there is a web form at the bottom of the page allowing the creation of new users with full privileges, effectively allowing an attacker to create a new administrator without any prior authentication. This requires `globals on` setting in version 0.4.8 or earlier and is exploitable regardless of `globals` setting in version 0.4.6.",

          "description": "Arbitrary files can be uploaded with arbitrary extensions. An attacker assigned to at least one project can upload files via `/managefile.php?action=showproject&id=<projectId>`. If a `.php` file is uploaded, the application changes the extension to `.txt` to prevent execution. This can be bypassed by changing the mimetype to `text/plain`, tricking the application into thinking it is a `.txt` file and not altering the extension. The file is uploaded to `/files/<projectId>/<filename>_$seed.php`. The `$seed` is derived from the microtime and can be bruteforced.",
