- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ASPDownload v1.03 script does not require authentication for the `setupdownload.asp` file. This allows an attacker to directly access this file, which is intended for setting up the download script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of authentication/authorization for a sensitive setup file (`setupdownload.asp`), which leads to an arbitrary change of administrator account details.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can reset the administrator's access and change the administrator's credentials. This grants them full administrative control of the application. Once logged in, they can upload an ASP shell, leading to remote code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: Direct HTTP request to the vulnerable `setupdownload.asp` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know or guess the path to the vulnerable script and be able to send HTTP requests to it.
