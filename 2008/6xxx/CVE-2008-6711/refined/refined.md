Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6711:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the web management interface of Avaya Communication Manager. This lack of proper validation allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Input validation vulnerability. This occurs when the system fails to sanitize or validate data entered by the user through the web interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker could potentially execute malicious code on the affected system, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, service disruption or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web management interface: Exploitation occurs through the web-based interface of the Avaya Communication Manager.
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the web management interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated access: The attacker must be a valid user of the Avaya Communication Manager's web interface.
- Network access: The attacker needs to have network access to the affected server. This could be from the local network or remotely if the web interface is exposed.

**Affected versions:**
- Avaya Communication Manager versions 3.1.x and 4.0.x are affected. Specifically:
    - 3.1.x is vulnerable and requires upgrade to version 3.1.4 SP2 or later.
    - 4.0.x is vulnerable and requires upgrade to version 4.0.3 SP1 or later.
- CM 5.0 and later versions are not vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to the recommended versions or later: Upgrade to Communication Manager 3.1.4 SP2 or later for 3.1.x and 4.0.3 SP1 or later for 4.0.x.
- Restrict access to the server: Until the upgrade is done, Avaya recommends limiting local and network access through physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs and other standard security practices.
