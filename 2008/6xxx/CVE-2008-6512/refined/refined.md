Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2008-6512:

**Summary:**

The blog post from blog.watchfire.com details a vulnerability in Google Gears' cross-origin communication model. The vulnerability stems from Google Gears' worker loader disregarding the Content-Type header of worker files. This allows attackers to bypass same-origin policies and execute malicious code within the context of a different domain, leading to data theft and user impersonation.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The core issue lies in Google Gears' worker loader ignoring the `Content-Type` header of files it loads as workers. This means it will load and execute JavaScript code even if the server declares it as a different content type (e.g., an image).

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Bypassed Same-Origin Policy:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the same-origin policy, a fundamental security mechanism in web browsers.
    *   **Lack of Content-Type Enforcement:** Google Gears' failure to enforce `Content-Type` headers when loading worker scripts is the primary weakness.
    *   **Remote Code Execution:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code (malicious Gears worker scripts) within the context of a different, trusted domain.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Theft:** Attackers can access sensitive information from a vulnerable website's database, local server data, or web resources (using the victim's credentials) via Google Gears' capabilities.
    *   **User Impersonation:** Malicious worker scripts can perform actions on behalf of a user due to the bypassed same-origin policy.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Although not a traditional XSS, the vulnerability is used to inject and execute code in another domain's context, similar in impact.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **User-Generated Content Upload:** Attackers can upload malicious worker code disguised as other content types (e.g., images) to a target domain that allows user-uploaded content (e.g., forums, social networks, webmail, etc.).
    *   **Remote Loading of Malicious Worker:** The attacker's website then triggers the loading and execution of the malicious worker code from the target domain using Google Gears.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs a site that can use Google Gears.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to find a way to host the malicious worker code on a target domain.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create a website that uses Google Gears to load the malicious code as a worker.

**Additional details:**
*   The article provides a detailed example of malicious worker code that fetches a sensitive page from the target site and leaks the information back to the attacker.
*   The fix implemented by Google required a special `Content-Type` header value (`application/x-gears-worker`) to be served by the web server when serving Google Gears worker code files. Without this header, the loading of worker files would be denied.
