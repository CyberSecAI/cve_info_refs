{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion due to the insecure usage of the `includepath` parameter in `includes/init.php`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL that sets the `includepath` parameter to a remote location hosting a malicious PHP file, the attacker can include the remote file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a publicly accessible server to host their malicious PHP file."
