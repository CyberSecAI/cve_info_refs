Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-6181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Joomla! Component "mad4Joomla Mailforms" is vulnerable to SQL injection. This occurs because the component does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `jid` parameter in the URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords.
*   **Potential System Compromise:**  While not explicitly stated, SQL injection can potentially allow for further exploitation such as privilege escalation or remote code execution.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker might gain unauthorized access to the Joomla! application or its underlying database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the vulnerable component:
    ```
    /index.php?option=com_mad4joomla&jid=[SQL]
    ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker requires some knowledge of SQL to construct a malicious query that can be used in the `jid` parameter.

**Exploit Example:**

The provided exploit example demonstrates how an attacker can use the `jid` parameter to extract usernames and passwords:
```
/index.php?option=com_mad4joomla&jid=-2+union+select+1,concat(username,char(58),password)KHG,3,4+from+jos_users--
```

This query utilizes `UNION SELECT` to inject a custom SQL query that retrieves `username` and `password` fields from the `jos_users` table and concatenates them.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by H!tm@N.
*   The affected component is "Mad4Joomla Mailforms (com_mad4joomla)".
*   The vulnerability was disclosed on 2008-10-10.
*   The advisory mentions the component was developed by Dipl. Inf. Fahrettin Kutyol.
