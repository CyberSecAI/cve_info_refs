The provided content is related to CVE-2008-6316 and describes a Local/Remote File Inclusion vulnerability in PHPmyGallery v1.0beta2.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure inclusion of files within the `_conf/core/common-tpl-vars.php` script. Specifically, the `require()` function on line 23 includes a language file based on the `$lang` variable and `$confdir` variable which are controllable by user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `$confdir` variable can be manipulated to include remote files, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code by pointing the confdir to a malicious file hosted on a remote server.
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `$lang` variable can be manipulated to include local files, allowing an attacker to read sensitive files from the server by specifying paths like `/etc/passwd` as a value of the lang parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Through RFI, an attacker can execute malicious PHP code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Through LFI, an attacker can read sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, and user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request Manipulation:** By crafting a specific URL with the vulnerable parameters, attackers can inject malicious code or include arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `common-tpl-vars.php` file.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit details show how to exploit both RFI and LFI. The RFI vector uses the `confdir` parameter, while LFI uses the `lang` parameter.
- The content also mentions that this vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2008-6315, CVE-2008-6316 and CVE-2008-6317.
