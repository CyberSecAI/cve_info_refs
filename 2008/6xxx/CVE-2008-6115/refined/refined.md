Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-6115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw present in the `directory.php` script of the "hostindex" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `directory.php` script before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, database names, version information, and potentially other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `directory.php` script, manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No prior authentication or special privileges are required.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious SQL query.
