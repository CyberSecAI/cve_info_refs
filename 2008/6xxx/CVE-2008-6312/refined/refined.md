The content is related to CVE-2008-6312.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `/admin/index.php` file of ProQuiz 1.0.
- The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `username` and `password` POST parameters into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the injection of malicious SQL code through the `username` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authentication Bypass: An attacker can bypass the administrative login process by injecting SQL code that will always evaluate to true in the authentication query.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests: The attack is conducted via a crafted POST request to `/admin/index.php`, containing a malicious SQL injection string in the `username` field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable ProQuiz application.
- No special privileges are needed: The attacker does not need any existing authentication or specific privileges to exploit the SQL injection.
- The attacker needs to know the path to `/admin/index.php`

**Exploit details:**
- The provided exploit uses the username `' or 1=1#` which bypasses the authentication by crafting the SQL query to always return true and log in to the admin page. The password can be anything. The resulting SQL query would be:
  `SELECT * FROM members_admin WHERE username = '' or 1=1#' AND password = 'anything'`
  The `1=1` will always be true and the `#` comments the rest of the query allowing the bypass.
