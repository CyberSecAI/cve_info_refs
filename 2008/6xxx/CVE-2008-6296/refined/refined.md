Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insecure cookie handling in the `admin.php` file of Maran PHP Shop. The code directly checks the value of the `user` cookie against the string "demo" to determine access.
*   **Weakness:** The application uses a client-side cookie to perform authentication, without proper server-side validation. The lack of any security mechanisms for the cookie itself, such as signing or encryption, means its contents can be freely modified by the user.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the `/admin.php` page by simply setting the `user` cookie to `demo`. This likely grants them access to administrative functions.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through the client-side by manipulating the `user` cookie.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `user` cookie, which can be achieved through client-side javascript, as given in the provided exploit.
