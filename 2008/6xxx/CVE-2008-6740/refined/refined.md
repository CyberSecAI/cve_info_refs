- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a remote file inclusion vulnerability in the `plugin_admin.php` file. The `_settings[pluginpath]` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include an external file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a GET request to the `plugin_admin.php` file, specifically by manipulating the `_settings[pluginpath]` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication or special network position is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker only needs to know the path to the vulnerable file.
