    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "Improperly validated user-controlled input in Flash files can lead to the execution of arbitrary ActionScript and JavaScript.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to insecure handling of user input in Flash files, specifically involving the 'asfunction' protocol and URL loading functions.",
        "Vulnerable templates or static Flash content within authoring tools can automatically introduce insecure ActionScript into generated SWF files."
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation enables cross-site scripting in the context of the domain hosting the vulnerable Flash file. This can allow attackers to spoof or modify web content, access website information such as cookies, or retrieve data from an encrypted HTTPS connection.",
      "attack_vectors": "Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities by injecting malicious input into Flash files through URLs or HTML text fields. Specifically, the 'asfunction' protocol can be used to call public and static functions within a Flash file by supplying a string parameter. Insecurely generated Flash files that embed vulnerable controller can also be used as an attack vector.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code within the Flash file or via inputs, typically through web requests or by getting the victim to interact with the crafted flash file, hosted on vulnerable websites. The vulnerabilities exist within the generated SWF files."
