    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_080904ad_20250124_145922.html",
      "root_cause": "Insecure cookie handling.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The application uses an insecure cookie to manage user sessions and permissions. Specifically, the cookie `xlaANMadmin_demo` is vulnerable because its values, including user ID, level, and permissions, can be directly manipulated by the user."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can gain administrative privileges by crafting a malicious cookie.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker directly modifies the cookie using JavaScript on the client-side (browser)."
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable application, and needs to know the cookie name to manipulate, along with the names of the parameters in that cookie to manipulate, including the parameters' effects/roles in the application"
