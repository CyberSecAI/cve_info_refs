```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The ASPPortal application stores its database file (ASPPortal.mdb) in a publicly accessible directory (Data) without proper access controls.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  Database Disclosure, Information Exposure.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can directly download the database file, potentially gaining access to sensitive data such as user credentials, application configurations, and other confidential information stored within the database.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exposed through direct access via HTTP to the publicly accessible database file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker only needs to know or guess the location of the database file (e.g., http://[Target]/[aspportal_path]/Data/ASPPortal.mdb) and does not require prior authentication or interaction with the web application other than to request the file.
