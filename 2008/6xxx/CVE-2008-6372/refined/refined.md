Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6372:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The Exploit-DB entry explicitly mentions "CVE: [2008-6372](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-6372)" confirming the relevance.
   - The vulnerability described aligns with the provided exploit details.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a **blind SQL Injection** vulnerability.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `ID` parameter when processing the `Action=Cat` request.
   - This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `ID` parameter.
   - The SQL injection is blind, meaning the application does not directly return the output of the injected query, making exploitation more difficult but still feasible.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   -  An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the application's database, modify the data, or potentially gain unauthorized access to the server hosting the database and/or application.
   - The impact is considered high, as it could lead to data breaches and full server compromise.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable application page, specifically using the parameters `Action=Cat` and `ID`.
   - The vulnerable URL structure is `site.com/?Action=Cat&ID=...`.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
   - The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
   - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.

**Additional notes:**
- The exploit-db entry includes proof of concept (PoC) URLs demonstrating the SQL injection.
- The description mentions the use of automated tools like sqlmap for exploitation.

**Summary:**

CVE-2008-6372 details a blind SQL injection vulnerability in Ocean12 FAQ Manager Pro. The vulnerability is located in the `ID` parameter used in `Action=Cat` requests. Exploitation allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious SQL queries, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure, modification, or full server takeover.
