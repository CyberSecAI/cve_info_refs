- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `connector.php` script in Mini-CWB versions 2.1.1 and earlier does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks due to improper handling of input parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, redirecting users to malicious sites, or stealing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious JavaScript code into several query string parameters of the `connector.php` script, namely `errcontext`, `_GET`, `_POST`, `_SESSION`, `_SERVER` and `fckphp_config[Debug_SERVER]`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to a victim. The victim must click on the malicious link while being logged in into the application.
