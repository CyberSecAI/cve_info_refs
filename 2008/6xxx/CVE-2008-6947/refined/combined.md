I. BACKGROUND

>From the Collabtive web site: "Collabtive is collaborative software to
get your projects done!".

II. DESCRIPTION

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Collabtive software.

III. ANALYSIS

Summary:

 A) Stored Cross Site Scripting
 B) Forceful browsing authentication bypass
 C) Arbitrary file upload

A) Stored Cross Site Scripting

A stored XSS vulnerability exists in the "/admin.php?action=projects"
section.

Once the attacker specifies an XSS attack vector, like
"<script>alert(0);</script>", as the "Name" property of a project then
an XSS vulnerability occurs because the projects "Name" fields are
stored and printed without any filtering.

While the cited section poses limits on the "Name" field when
reflecting the XSS payload, clicking on the edit link
"/manageproject.php?action=editform&id=<projectId>" results in a page
without limitations on the characters showed thus allowing complete
exploitation.

This vulnerability requires administrator authentication.

CSRF+XSS and timing (JS) can be used to successfully exploit this
vulnerability in an automated manner.

B) Forceful browsing authentication bypass

An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in
"/admin.php?action=users&mode=added". Directly pointing to that URL
shows an error, however at the bottom of the page there is a web
form that permits to create new users with full privileges.

With this vulnerability an attacker without any valid credentials can
create a new valid administrator.

Since this vulnerability has been discovered the exploitation
prerequisites changed as detailed below:

- A bug fix in the latest version 0.4.8 now requires "globals on" in
order to exploit this vulnerability.

- In version 0.4.6 instead the vulnerability is exploitable regardless
the "globals" settings.

C) Arbitrary file upload

It's possible to upload arbitrary files with arbitrary extensions.
An attacker that has not already gained Administration privileges using
the previously exposed vulnerabilities must be assigned to at least one
project.

To upload a file go to "/managefile.php?action=showproject&id=<projectId>"
and add a new file.

If a file with .php extension is uploaded then the mimetype will be
"php/plain" and the program will change the extension to .txt in order
to prevent exploitation.

This security control can be bypassed changing the mimetype to
text/plain, in this way the application will believe that a normal .txt
file was uploaded and the extension will not be changed.

The uploaded file resides in "/files/<projectId>/<filename>_$seed.php".

An authenticated attacker will simply see the seed (and the complete
filename) using the web interface and can directly execute it.

In case of unauthenticated attackers the filename must be guessed.
Luckily the make_seed() routine leaks real random proprieties and is
only based on the time. $seed can be easily bruteforced using values
that are likely to match the return derived by the microtime() of the
upload.

private function make_seed()
{
    list($usec, $sec) = explode(' ', microtime());
    $value = (float) $sec + ((float) $usec * 100000);
    return $value;
}

As easily understandable $seed can be guessed in really few tries. The
same vulnerability exists when attaching a file in the "Messages"
section.

This vulnerability can also be exploited via CSRF.

IV. DETECTION

Collabtive 0.4.8 and possibly earlier versions are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Proper input validation will fix the vulnerabilities.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

No fix available.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

No CVE at this time.

VIII. DISCLOSURE TIMELINE

20080926 Initial vendor contact (No Response)
20081003 Second vendor contact (No Response)
20081010 Third vendor contact
20081010 Vendor response (Fix promised for the end of October)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
