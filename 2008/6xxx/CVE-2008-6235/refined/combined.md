How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- vim, gvim
The VI Improved editor (vim) was prone to several security problems:
CVE-2008-4677: The netrw plugin sent credentials to all servers.
CVE-2008-2712: Arbitrary code execution in vim helper plugins
filetype, zip, xpm, gzip and netrw.
CVE-2008-3074: tarplugin code injection
CVE-2008-3075: zipplugin code injection
CVE-2008-3076: several netrw bugs, code injection
CVE-2008-6235: code injection in the netrw plugin
CVE-2008-4677: credential disclosure by netrw plugin
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
On openSUSE vim was upgraded to version 7.2.108 to fix those issues.
SLES9 and 10 were only affected by a subset, patches were backported
to fix the problems.
- apache2
A DoS condition in apache2's mod\_proxy has been fixed
(CVE-2008-2364).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3
- opera
Opera 9.64 is a recommended security and stability upgrade,
incorporating the Opera Presto 2.1.1 user agent engine. Opera highly
recommends all users to upgrade to Opera 9.64 to take advantage of
these improvements (CVE-2009-0914, CVE-2009-0915, CVE-2009-0916).
A detailed changelog can be found at
<http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/964/>
- multipath tools
/var/run/multipathd.sock was world-writable allowing local users to
issue commands to the multipath daemon (CVE-2009-0115).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES10
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
Specially crafted image files could cause an integer overflow in the
lcms library contained in openjdk. Attackers could potentially
exploit that to crash applications using lcms or even execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0581, CVE-2009-0733).
Previous update packages contained broken dependencies and couldn't
be installed. Therefore the update had to be re-released.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1
- imp
Version update to IMP 4.1.6 fixes a problem with validating HTTP requests that
allowed attackers to delete emails (CVE-2007-6018) and some
cross-site-scripting issues (CVE-2009-0930).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- horde
Version update to horde 3.1.9 fixes a cross-site-scripting (XSS) issue
(CVE-2008-5917) and an include file problem (CVE-2009-0932).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- lcms
Specially crafted image files could cause an integer overflow in
lcms. Attackers could potentially exploit that to crash applications
using lcms or even execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0723,
CVE-2009-0581, CVE-2009-0733).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
- moodle
moodle was prone to several cross-site-scripting (XSS) and
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) problems (CVE-2009-0499, CVE-2009-0500,
CVE-2009-0501, CVE-2009-0502).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- ghostscript
Integer overflows and missing upper bounds checks in Ghostscript's
ICC library potentially allowed attackers to crash Ghostscript or
even cause execution of arbitrary code via specially crafted PS or
PDF files (CVE-2009-0583, CVE-2009-0584).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES9, SLES10
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- NetworkManager
The NetworkManager update caused WLAN to stop working on some
systems. Those systems most likely have a stale directory
/var/run/dbus/at\_console/root. It's most likely a leftover from a
root session. Removing the directory and restarting networking
should fix the problems. Please avoid logging in as root in the future.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.

Subject: CVE request - Vim netrw.plugin

Hello Steve,

  summarizing till today known information about the Vim netrw.vim
plugin issues.

1. issue:
=========

* Original advisories: <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.html>
                       <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v2.html>

* CVE id: CVE-2008-3076 already used in rPath advisory
          <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/10/7>

* Testcases: netrw.v2 (the 'mz' command issue)
             netrw.v3 (the 'mc' command issue)
             netrw.v4 (the "D' command issue)

* Steps to reproduce:

  1, The 'mz' command (testcase netrw.v2)
     a, Open directory containing a file with malicious name
     b, Point the cursor to line with this file
     c, In Vim shell type  ":normal mfmz" (selects this file to be compressed/decompressed)
     d, Close Vim ":q"

     Result: In vulnerable Vim versions file isn't (de)compressed and "pwned" file is
             created.

     Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.2alpha+
     Not affected Vim versions:
       -- Vim 7.0, 7.1 affected only in case you manually reinstall
          older version of netrw.vim via vimball.
                            manually reinstall older (vul
       -- Vim 6.0 not affected (netrw.vim not shipped there).
     Affected netrw.vim plugin versions: 111 <= x <= 123

     Proposed solution: Should stay as a part of CVE-2008-3076.

   2, The 'mc' command (testcase netrw.v3)
      a, Open directory containing a file with malicious name
      b, Select some directory as move/copy target (moving via ../)
      c, Mark this directory as move/copy target, i.e in Vim
         shell perform command ":normal mfmt"
         (new line containing "Copy/Move Tgt: selected_directory"
          should appear)
      d, In Vim return to directory containing file with malicious
         filename
      e, Point the cursor to line containing this filename
      f, In Vim perform copy command, i.e. in Vim shell
         "normal mfmc"
      g, Close Vim ":q"

      Result: Vulnerable Vim and netrw.vim versions don't copy the file,
              "pwned" file is created.

      Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.2alpha+
      Not affected Vim versions:
        -- Vim 7.0, Vim 7.1 affected only in case you manually reinstall
           older version of netrv.vim via vimball.
        -- Vim 6.0 not affected (netrw.vim not shipped there).
      Affected netrw.vim plugin versions: 113 <= x <= 122

      Proposed solution: Should stay as a part of CVE-2008-3076.

   3, The 'D' command (testcase netrw.v4)
      a, Open directory containing a file with malicious name
      b, Point the cursor to the "executable' part of the
         filename (i.e. "eval `echo 0:64617465203e3e2070776e6564 | xxd -r`)
      c, Press the 'D' key
      d, Confirm the deletion request with 'y'.
      e, Close Vim ":q"

      Result: Vulnerable Vim and netrw.vim versions don't delete the file,
              "pwned" file is created.

      Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.0, Vim 7.1 (affected every time,
                             no manual reinstallation of older netrw.vim
                             plugin needed).
      Not affected Vim versions:
        -- Vim.6.0 (netrw.vim not shipped there).
        -- Vim 7.2 (already fixed).
      Affected vim.netrw plugin versions: 102 <= x <= 123

      Proposed solution: Should be split into a new CVE id (and possibly
                         merged with netrw.v5 issue as it affects Vim 7.0,
                         Vim 7.1 and is fixed in Vim 7.2 as the netrw.v5 issue).

* Action: Formulate CVE-2008-3076 as covering the 'mz' and 'mc' command issues.
          Merge the 'D' command issue with new CVE id allocated to netrw.v5
          issue (as both of these issues affect Vim 7.0, 7.1 and are already
          fixed in Vim 7.2).

2. issue:
=========

* Original advisory: <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v5.html>
                     <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v2.html> (the 'D' command part)

* CVE id: Still needs a new CVE id

* Testcase: netrw.v5

* Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.0, Vim 7.1
  Not affected Vim versions:
    -- Vim 6.0 (netrw.vim not shipped there)
    -- Vim 7.2 (already fixed)

* Action: Allocate a new CVE id, merge the description with the 'D' command issue
          from the CVE-2008-3076 issue.

* References: <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v5.html>

3. issue:
=========

CVE-2008-3432 <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3432>
Affects: Vim 6.2, 6.3 (others not affected)

Hope has answered questions from: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/08/01/1>

Steve, could you please:  1, join netrw 'mz' and 'mc' commnad issues under CVE-2008-3076,
                          2, allocate a new CVE id and merge the 'D' command issue and
                             netrw.v5 issue under this new CVE (as these two both affect
                             Vim 7.0 and 7.1) and
                          3, allocate a new CVE id for the Vim netrw: FTP user credentials
                             disclosure issue?

Jan, your comments are appreciated.

Regards, Jan.
