Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl:

**Vulnerability A: `IPureServer::_Recieve` buffer-overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** The `_Recieve` function copies data from a network packet into a fixed-size 8KB stack buffer using `memcpy`. The size of the data to copy is determined by a 16-bit value within the packet.
*   **Weakness:**  A lack of proper bounds checking on the size parameter allows the attacker to specify a size larger than the destination buffer.
*   **Impact:** Stack-based buffer overflow, enabling arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted UDP packet containing a 0x39 byte, compressed data using LZO, and a 16-bit value greater than 8KB.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to join the server and send the crafted UDP packet. The attacker can control the overflowed buffer content.

**Vulnerability B: `NET_Compressor::Decompress` integer overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** The function checks for a specific byte (0xc1) to determine if data is compressed. If not compressed, it uses `memcpy(dst, data, data_size - 1)`.
*   **Weakness:** When a packet with no data is sent,  `data_size` is 0, leading to `memcpy(dst, data, 0 - 1)` resulting in `memcpy(dst, data, 0xffffffff)`.
*   **Impact:** Integer overflow leading to a crash due to the large `memcpy`.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a UDP packet with no data after the initial byte.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to join the server and send the crafted UDP packet.

**Vulnerability C: `MultipacketReciever::RecievePacket` INT3**

*   **Root Cause:** The `MultipacketReciever::RecievePacket` function checks if a byte in the packet is equal to 0xe0 or 0xe1. If not, an `INT3` instruction is executed.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation of the initial byte.
*   **Impact:** Immediate server termination due to INT3 instruction.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted UDP packet with an initial byte that is not 0xe0 or 0xe1.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to join the server and send the crafted UDP packet.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely against the server and probably clients as well.
*   The game's protocol lacks proper handshaking, which allows spoofing packets, thus bypassing IP bans.
*   Exploit code is available at `http://aluigi.org/poc/stalker39x.zip`.
*   No fix was available at the time of the analysis.
