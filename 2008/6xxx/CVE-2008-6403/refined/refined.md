```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `insert.inc.php` file where the `tpl_dir` parameter from the URL is directly included in a PHP `include` statement without proper sanitization or validation.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include a remote file, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Attack vectors: By manipulating the `tpl_dir` parameter in the URL of the `insert.inc.php` script.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a malicious PHP file to include.
