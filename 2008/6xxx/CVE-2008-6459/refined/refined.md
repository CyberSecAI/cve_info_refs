The provided content is a security bulletin for TYPO3, specifically **TYPO3-20080919-1**, which includes details of multiple vulnerabilities found in various third-party extensions. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities Identified:**

The bulletin lists multiple extensions with vulnerabilities, which can be categorized as follows:

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Extensions Affected:**
        *   `auto BE User Registration (autobeuser)`
        *   `Swigmore institute (cgswigmore)`
        *   `FE address edit for tt_address & direct mail (dmaddredit)`
        *   `Simple Random Objects (mw_random_objects)`
        *    `My quiz and poll (myquizpoll)`
        *   `Random Prayer Version 2 (ste_prayer2)`
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user inputs leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially manipulate SQL queries, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification or deletion.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Malicious user input through the application's interface or parameters, injected into SQL queries.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to interact with the vulnerable application interface, or modify request parameters to inject malicious SQL.
    *   **Severity:** HIGH
*   **Blind SQL Injection:**
    *   **Extensions Affected:**
        *   `HBook (h_book)`
         *   `Diocese of Portsmouth Church Search (pd_churchsearch)`
        *   `Another Backend Login (wrg_anotherbelogin)`
    *   **Root Cause:** Similar to SQL injection, but the application does not provide direct output about the query.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can extract data by sending many requests and observing the application's behavior/response times.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**  Malicious user input through the application's interface or parameters.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to interact with the vulnerable application interface or manipulate request parameters.
    *   **Severity:** HIGH
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**
    *   **Extension Affected:** `Secure Directory (kw_secdir)`
    *   **Root Cause:** Unspecified vulnerability leading to the execution of arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could execute code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting the vulnerability to inject and execute malicious code.
    *    **Required Capabilities:** Ability to exploit the identified vulnerability.
    *   **Severity:** HIGH
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Extension Affected:** `File List (file_list)`
    *   **Root Cause:** Unspecified issue leading to information disclosure.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting the vulnerability to access sensitive information.
    *    **Required Capabilities:** Ability to exploit the identified vulnerability.
    *   **Severity:** LOW

**Mitigation:**

*   **Uninstall and Delete:** For extensions where no fix is available (`autobeuser`, `dmaddredit`, `file_list`, `h_book`, `mw_random_objects`), the recommended action is to uninstall and delete the extension folder from the TYPO3 installation. These extensions were also removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository.
*   **Update:** For extensions where a fixed version is available (`cgswigmore`, `kw_secdir`, `myquizpoll`, `pd_churchsearch`, `ste_prayer2`, `wrg_anotherbelogin`), the recommendation is to update to the patched version via the TYPO3 extension manager or by downloading from the provided links.

**General Advice:**

*   The bulletin advises users to follow recommendations in the TYPO3 SECURITY Guide and to subscribe to the typo3-announce mailing list for future security updates.
*   It also specifies that these vulnerabilities are in third-party extensions and not part of the TYPO3 core.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bulletin introduces the concept of Collective Security Bulletins (CSBs) to address vulnerabilities in less critical third-party extensions to reduce the workload on the Security Team and the extension authors.
*   The bulletin credits the individuals who discovered and reported the vulnerabilities.
