    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-6025",
      "description": "OpenElec <= v3.01 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI). The vulnerability exists in the `form.php` script. The script takes a user-controlled parameter 'obj' and includes a file based on it without proper sanitization. The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting directory traversal sequences like `../../`.",
      "root_cause": "The `form.php` script directly includes a file based on user-provided input without proper sanitization.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server filesystem. This could potentially lead to disclosure of sensitive information like configuration files and even execution of arbitrary code through inclusion of crafted files.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET parameter manipulation"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a specific URL that includes the 'obj' parameter with directory traversal sequences and the target file path."
