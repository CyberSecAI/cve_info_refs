        "vulnerability_details": {
            "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection and Local File Inclusion due to insecure handling of user-supplied input in the 'id' and 'bit' parameters within the URL.",

            "impact": "An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to read sensitive files from the server and potentially extract database credentials or other sensitive information. With the SQL injection, attackers can extract user credentials (username and password) from the database. Local File Inclusion can allow reading arbitrary files from the server if the attacker has knowledge of file paths.",
