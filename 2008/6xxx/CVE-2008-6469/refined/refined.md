- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `p` parameter within the `index.php` file. This allows for SQL injection attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries to read sensitive data from the database (like usernames and passwords), potentially leading to complete compromise of the web application and server.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a specially crafted `p` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
