Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in moziloWiki as described in the MajorSecurity advisory:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

1.  **Directory Traversal:** The `print.php` script uses the `page` parameter without proper sanitization, allowing directory traversal.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `index.php` script uses the `action` and `page` parameters without proper sanitization, allowing injection of malicious code.
3.  **Session Fixation:** The application accepts an arbitrary `PHPSESSID` parameter, allowing an attacker to fix a user's session ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:**  Failure to sanitize user-provided input in the `page` parameter within `print.php`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of proper sanitization/encoding of user-provided input in the `action` and `page` parameters within `index.php`
*   **Session Fixation:** The application's failure to regenerate session IDs after user authentication, and acceptance of arbitrary session IDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** Allows attackers to access files outside of the webroot, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Enables attackers to execute arbitrary HTML and script code within a user's browser session, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.
*  **Session Fixation:** Allows an attacker to hijack a user's session after they login, granting the attacker the same privileges as the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** By crafting a malicious HTTP request to `print.php` including directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) in the `page` parameter.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By crafting a malicious URL to `index.php` with malicious JavaScript or HTML in the `action` or `page` parameters.
*   **Session Fixation:** By providing a specific `PHPSESSID` value before a user logs in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   For XSS, the attacker needs to lure a victim to click on a malicious link or visit a page containing malicious input.
*   For session fixation, the attacker needs to predefine the session ID and trick a user into logging into the application with that ID.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory indicates that the vendor was contacted and released a patch (version 1.0.2) to fix the issues.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by David Vieira-Kurz of MajorSecurity.
*   The advisory lists specific affected files and parameters, which provides more detail than a typical CVE description.
