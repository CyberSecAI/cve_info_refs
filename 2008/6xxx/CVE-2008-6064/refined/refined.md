```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `cat` parameter before using it in an SQL query.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/agenda/index.php` file due to the lack of input sanitization.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/agenda/index.php` page by manipulating the `cat` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is required.
