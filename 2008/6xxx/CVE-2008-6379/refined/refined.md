Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6379:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection flaw present in the `pics_pre.asp` file of Gallery MX 2.0.0. The `ID` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code.
*   **Weakness:**  The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query, leading to SQL injection. This is a classic example of a lack of input validation.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially extract sensitive information from the database, modify data, or potentially gain further access to the system. In the case of blind SQL Injection, attackers cannot directly see the data but infer the results of their queries by observing the application's behavior.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is located in the web application and exploited through HTTP requests by manipulating the `ID` parameter in the URL. Specifically, the vulnerable URL is `http://gallery.mxmania.net/pics_pre.asp?ID=[SQL Injection payload]`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They do not need to be authenticated users. They must have knowledge of SQL syntax and blind injection techniques.
*   **Technical Details**
    *   The exploit uses `pics_pre.asp?ID=1 and 1=1` to check for a true condition and `pics_pre.asp?ID=1 and 1=2` for a false condition, demonstrating the existence of blind SQL injection.
    *   The attacker can infer the results of the query based on the response of the server which will be different if the condition is true or false.
