Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6157:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a combination of SQL injection vulnerability and cleartext storage of passwords within the database. Specifically, the `classdis.asp` page is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `ID` parameter. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication and directly extract usernames and passwords stored in plaintext from the `members` table within the `classifieds.mdb` database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The `classdis.asp` page is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `ID` parameter. Input validation is missing or insufficient, allowing arbitrary SQL queries to be executed.
- Cleartext Password Storage: The application stores user passwords in plaintext within the `members` table. This makes it easy to recover user credentials when SQL injection is successfully performed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Complete compromise of user accounts: An attacker can extract usernames and passwords for all users (including admin), which allows full access to accounts and their associated functions.
- Potential for further attacks: With access to admin credentials, the attacker can likely gain full control of the application and potentially the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a web browser.
- Malicious SQL injection: The attacker injects SQL code within the `ID` parameter in the URL. Examples provided are:
    - `classdis.asp?ID=1 union select 0,1,username,3 from members` to extract usernames.
    - `classdis.asp?ID=1 union select 0,1,password,3 from members` to extract passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
- No specific user authentication/authorization requirements since the vulnerability allows bypassing it.

**Additional Details:**
- The application in question is Sepcity Classified, a free classified software.
- The specific vulnerable file is `classdis.asp`.
- The passwords are stored in `classifieds.mdb`.
- The exploit allows direct retrieval of the username and passwords from the database via `union select` statement.
- The admin login page for this application is located at `admclassifieds.asp`.
