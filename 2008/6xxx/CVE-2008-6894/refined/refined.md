Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in 3CX 6.0.806.0:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Issue 1: Session Hijacking:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  3CX does not use HTTPS by default, allowing an attacker to sniff the administrator's session ID.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of secure communication protocol (HTTPS) leading to exposure of session IDs in transit.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can impersonate the administrator and perform actions on their behalf.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Network sniffing
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to sniff network traffic to capture session IDs.

*   **Issue 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `fName` and `fPassword` fields on the login page (`login.php`) are vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input sanitization/validation on user-supplied data.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the login page and execute arbitrary code in the user's browser.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Malicious XSS payload input into the vulnerable fields
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to manipulate form input fields with malicious payloads

*   **Issue 3: Information Disclosure:**
    *  **Root Cause:** When the disk where 3CX is installed reaches 100% capacity, the login.php page reveals the installation path.
    *   **Weakness:**  Error handling in login.php exposes sensitive path information when disk space is full.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can learn the installation path, which may aid in further attacks.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Fill the disk that 3CX is installed on.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to fill the disk where 3CX is installed.

*   **Issue 4: Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Vulnerability scanning (using tools like Nessus/SAINT) against a 3CX server causes it to crash and become unrecoverable, requiring a reinstall.
    *   **Weakness:** 3CX server is not resilient against vulnerability scanning
    *   **Impact:** Server becomes unstable, crashes and must be reinstalled.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Scanning the server with vulnerability scanning tools
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to run vulnerability scans.
