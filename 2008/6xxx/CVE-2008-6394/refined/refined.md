      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-6394",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_385bb904_20250124_161650.html",
      "root_cause": "Improper input validation of cookie data within the `fn_get_cookie()` function, allowing for SQL injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can bypass authentication to gain unauthorized access to user and administrator accounts, as well as retrieve arbitrary data from the database.",
       "attack_vector": "By manipulating the `customer_user_id` and `password` cookies, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into a database query.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to set arbitrary cookie values in the victim's browser. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerable code is located in `/core/user.php`. The `fn_get_cookie()` function returns the cookie value without proper sanitization, leading to the SQL injection vulnerability. For example, an attacker can specify a cookie such as `cs_cookies[customer_user_id]=1'/*;` to bypass authentication as the customer with ID 1. The injection happens in the middle of a SELECT statement. An updated version of CS-Cart has been released to fix this issue."
