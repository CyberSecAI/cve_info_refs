Information disclosure can expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties. SQL Injection can allow an attacker to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.",

For XSS this would be injecting malicious script into the application, for Information disclosure this would be accessing files or data that should not be accessible. For SQL Injection this would be injecting malicious sql queries to be run against the database."
