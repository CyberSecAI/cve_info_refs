        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `forummessages.cfm` script, specifically in the `topicnbr` and `categorynbr` parameters, allowing for SQL injection.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind SQL injection vulnerability.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or potentially gain control of the server.",
         "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed by crafting specific URLs with SQL injection payloads in the `topicnbr` and `categorynbr` parameters.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication or special network position is mentioned."
