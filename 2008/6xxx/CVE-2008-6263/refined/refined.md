Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6263

**Vulnerability:** Blind SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when handling user-supplied data within the `view` parameter of the SaturnCMS application's gallery component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, specifically a "blind" variant, meaning the attacker does not see the output of the injected query. Instead, the attacker relies on the application's response time or behavior to determine the results of the injection.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database by crafting specific SQL injection queries. This is achieved through a blind SQL injection technique, meaning the attacker must infer the results based on response behavior rather than seeing direct query output. For example, an attacker can use `substring` to read the database version character by character.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The exploit also details a method for bypassing the authentication mechanism by injecting a SQL condition into the username field. By submitting `admin ' or 1=1` as the username, the attacker could potentially bypass authentication, although the linked exploit does not go into details on the bypass itself (it is expected the condition would cause the SQL query to return an existing user in the database, which would bypass the login check)
*   **Full Database compromise:** Depending on database permissions, an attacker could modify or delete data as well.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to a vulnerable URL, specifically the `gallery/web/view` component of the application. The `view` parameter is where the malicious SQL code is injected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL syntax and how to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities, especially blind SQL injection.
*   **Limited application knowledge:** Only a basic understanding of web applications is required. The attacker doesn't necessarily need prior credentials since authentication bypass is part of the exploit.

**More Details Than CVE:**
The provided content contains a detailed explanation of the vulnerable URL structure, along with specific example payloads used to exploit the blind SQL injection and authentication bypass. The exploit also details the username and password for an admin account, which is not covered in the official CVE details. This information provides concrete examples of how the vulnerability can be exploited in practice, including specific SQL injection syntax to extract data from the underlying database. The exploit also specifies that the vulnerable software is SaturnCMS.

**Example Exploitation:**

The exploit details these examples of exploitation:
1. Blind SQL Injection
   * Vulnerable URL: `http://demo.saturncms.com/gallery/web/view/22`
   * Example Queries:
     *   `http://demo.saturncms.com/gallery/web/view/22+and+substring(@@version,1,1)=5`
     *   `http://demo.saturncms.com/gallery/web/view/22+and+substring(@@version,1,1)=4`
     *   `http://demo.saturncms.com/gallery/web/view/22+and+(SELECT 1 from mysql.user limit 0,1)=1`

2. Auth Bypass:
    * Vulnerable URL: `http://demo.saturncms.com/admin`
    * Username: `admin ' or 1=1`
    * Password: `milw0rm`
