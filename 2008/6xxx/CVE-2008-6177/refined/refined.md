Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6177

**Vulnerability Description:**
This CVE refers to multiple Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities found in LightBlog 9.8. These vulnerabilities exist in the `view_member.php`, `login.php`, and `check_user.php` files.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the insecure use of user-supplied input (GET, POST, and COOKIE parameters) within `include()` statements. The application directly includes files based on the provided `username` parameter from GET and POST requests, and `Lightblog_username` cookie, without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to include local files from the server by manipulating the username parameter. The code constructs file paths by concatenating user-controlled input with hardcoded directories.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user input, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary files via directory traversal using techniques such as `../`.
- **Insecure Use of `include()`:** The use of user-controlled values directly in the `include()` statement makes the application vulnerable to LFI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, including configuration files, source code, or system files like `/etc/passwd`.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** If an attacker can upload a malicious file to the server, they could include it and execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GET Parameter:** By manipulating the `username` parameter in the URL to `view_member.php`, an attacker can include arbitrary files.
- **POST Parameter:** By sending a POST request to `login.php` with a manipulated `username_post` parameter, an attacker can include arbitrary files.
- **COOKIE Parameter:** By setting a malicious value to the `Lightblog_username` cookie, an attacker can include arbitrary files when `check_user.php` is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable LightBlog application.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate GET/POST parameters or browser cookies.
- No authentication is required for exploiting this vulnerability.

**More Detail than CVE Description:**
The exploit-db content provides detailed Proof-of-Concept (PoC) examples, demonstrating how to exploit each of the vulnerable files using GET, POST, and COOKIE parameters. It also shows how to perform directory traversal to read arbitrary files like `/etc/passwd`.
