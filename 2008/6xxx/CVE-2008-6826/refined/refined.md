Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6826

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `dhtml.pl` script of the Ads Pro application. Specifically, the `page` parameter is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The `page` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server running the Ads Pro application. This could lead to:
  - Complete compromise of the server.
  - Data theft or manipulation.
  - Installation of malware or backdoors.
  - Denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the `dhtml.pl` script, including malicious commands within the `page` parameter.
  - Example exploit URLs:
     - `http://serv.com/cgi-bin/adspro/dhtml.pl?page=advert_top.htm|id|`
     - `http://serv.com/cgi-bin/adspro/dhtml.pl?page=advert_login.htm|id|`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable Ads Pro application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable application is Ads Pro.
- The vulnerable script is `dhtml.pl`.
- The vulnerability was reported on October 26, 2008.

This exploit allows remote code execution by injecting commands into the `page` parameter of the `dhtml.pl` script. The example provided shows how to use the `|id|` command to confirm the vulnerability exists but more harmful commands could be injected as well.
