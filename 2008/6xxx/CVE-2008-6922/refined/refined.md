{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the CMailCOM.dll component of Youngzsoft CMailServer. Specifically, the `MoveToFolder` method of the `CMailCOM.POP3` class is vulnerable.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow",
	"Unvalidated input"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on the server with the privileges of the NETWORK SERVICE account. This can lead to complete system compromise and unauthorized access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted string to the `indexOfMail` parameter of the `mvmail.asp` page after authenticating. This string is then passed to the vulnerable `MoveToFolder` method in `CMailCOM.dll`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Remote access to the vulnerable CMailServer instance",
	"Valid user account on the server (which can be obtained by exploiting signup.asp)",
    "Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the server"
  ],
  "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is a Stack-Based Buffer Overflow and can be exploited using SEH overwrite technique. The exploit uses a crafted shellcode to execute calc.exe, demonstrating arbitrary code execution. Multiple vulnerable methods have been discovered in the CMailCOM.dll, such as CreateUserPath, Logout, DeleteMailByUID, MoveToInbox, DeleteMailEx, GetMailDataEx, SetReplySign, SetForwardSign, and SetReadSign, however, these are not directly exploitable remotely due to input validations. The CMailCOM.SMTP class is also vulnerable in several methods including AddAttach, SetSubject, SetBcc, SetBody, SetCc, SetFrom, SetTo and SetFromUID."
