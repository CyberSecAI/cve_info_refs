Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-6626:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the authentication mechanism of WEBBDOMAIN Quiz version 1.02. Specifically, it is due to a lack of proper input sanitization or validation in the login process of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, enabling attackers to bypass the login authentication. The provided exploit demonstrates how an attacker can gain unauthorized access by injecting a SQL statement in the username field to bypass authentication checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to log in as an administrator, granting them full access to the application's administrative functions. This level of access can enable an attacker to view and manipulate sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed via the application's web-based login interface, by manipulating the login form fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's web interface.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious username payload.
*   **No Credentials Required:** The exploit allows an attacker to log in without valid credentials, using the injected SQL query.

**Technical Details:**
* The attacker uses the string `admin ' or ' 1=1` in the username field and `Hakxer` in the password field. The SQL injection bypasses the authentication, granting access with an admin session.

This information is consistent with the CVE description that mentions an authentication bypass vulnerability.
