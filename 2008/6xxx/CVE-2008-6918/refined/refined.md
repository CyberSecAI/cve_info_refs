{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an insecure file upload implementation in the `galeria.php` script of ThePortal 2.2. The `upload.php` script provided allows an attacker to specify a target URL, and then upload an arbitrary file (`own.php` containing malicious code) to the specified web server through a vulnerable `galeria.php` endpoint.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Upload",
      "Authentication Bypass (as implied by the ability to upload via `/admin/galeria.php?akcja=dodaj_foto` without explicit authentication in the provided code)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the target server. In the provided example, the attacker overwrites the `index.php` file to display `OWNED...`, but any other malicious code could be included.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker crafts a `own.php` file with malicious PHP code and uses the provided `upload.php` script to upload this file via the vulnerable `/admin/galeria.php?akcja=dodaj_foto` endpoint to the target server.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to run the `upload.php` script and needs to know the target URL of the vulnerable `ThePortal` installation."
