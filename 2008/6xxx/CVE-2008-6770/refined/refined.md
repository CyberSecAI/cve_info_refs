        "Arbitrary Data Saving: The application saves user-controlled data into a PHP file without proper sanitization.",
	"Remote Code Execution: By inserting malicious PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server."

          "code": "The provided Perl exploit sends a POST request to the vulnerable file with a malicious payload. It establishes a shell by executing commands via HTTP GET requests. The script includes functionality for connecting to a server, writing malicious code, executing commands, and providing a banner. It performs input checking before initiating the exploit."
