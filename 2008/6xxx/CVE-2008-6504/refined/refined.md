Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6504:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) expressions are handled within the Apache Struts 2 framework. Specifically, the protection mechanism implemented by the ParametersInterceptor to prevent manipulation of server-side context objects using '#' character was bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **OGNL Expression Injection:** Malicious users can craft special OGNL expressions that bypass the intended '#' character restrictions. This allows them to inject arbitrary OGNL code through HTTP request parameters.
- **Context Manipulation:** The injected OGNL expressions enable attackers to access and modify server-side context objects, such as session data, application variables, etc.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Server Context Manipulation:** Attackers can gain the ability to manipulate the server-side context of the application.
- **Data Modification/Disclosure:** This can lead to unauthorized modification of application data, disclosure of sensitive information, or other malicious activities.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating user session data, an attacker could potentially escalate their privileges.
- **Full compromise of the web application**

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Parameters:** The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted HTTP request parameters.
- **URL Encoding:** Attackers may use URL encoding (e.g., replacing '#' with '%23' and other characters) to disguise their malicious OGNL expressions.
- **Direct manipulation of input:** Attackers can directly modify the input data to bypass the intended security checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of OGNL:** An understanding of OGNL syntax and the structure of Struts 2 context objects is required to exploit this vulnerability effectively.
- **Ability to craft malicious HTTP requests**

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Apache Struts versions 2.0.0 to 2.1.8.1.
*   The fix is to upgrade to at least Struts 2.2.1.
*   The example exploit shows how to set `#session.user` to `0wn3d` by crafting the parameter name `('\u0023' + 'session\'user\'')(unused)` and assigning the value `0wn3d`
