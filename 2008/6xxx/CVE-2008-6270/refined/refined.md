{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the SQL query within the `apoll/admin/index.php` file. It directly incorporates user-supplied input ($user and $pass) into the SQL query without proper sanitization, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection. The application is vulnerable because it directly injects user-provided username and password into the database query.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the admin panel by injecting SQL code into the username field.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the login form at `http://localhost/apoll/admin/index.php`. The attacker manipulates the username field with a SQL injection payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only requires a web browser to access the login form, knowledge of SQL injection techniques and the application is available to them."
