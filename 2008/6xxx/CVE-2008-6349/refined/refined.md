Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `survey_results_text.php` script in TurnkeyForms Business Survey Pro 1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code via the `id` parameter.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: By exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can potentially:
    *   Retrieve sensitive data from the database, like usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
    *   Modify data in the database, which could lead to manipulation of survey results or other data corruption.
    *   Potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server, potentially gaining full control of the database server.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a web-based attack through the `survey_results_text.php` page. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is the vulnerable point.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server where the vulnerable application is hosted. No authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability.

The provided exploit example shows a standard `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique, indicating that the application is directly concatenating the `id` parameter into an SQL query without adequate sanitization or escaping.
