Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the Exploit Database entry for CVE-2008-6995:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Google Chrome version 0.2.149.27 handles undefined handlers in `chrome.dll`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of undefined handlers followed by a "special" character. This leads to a crash when the browser attempts to process a crafted URI with an undefined scheme. Specifically, the issue is related to the `POP EBP` instruction when pointed to by the `EIP` register at address `0x01002FF4`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). The browser crashes, closing all open tabs. The user sees the "Whoa! Google Chrome has crashed. Restart now?" message.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious link. The user needs to be tricked into visiting a specific URI with an undefined handler followed by a special character, for example `EVIL:%`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted URI to the victim, which can be done through methods such as phishing, embedding a link on a website, etc.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the victim machine. They can achieve the DoS with a crafted link.
