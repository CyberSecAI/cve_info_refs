    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_09acd9b8_20250125_115757.html",
      "vulnerability": "Multiple Local File Inclusions",
      "description": "The PunBB (Private Messaging System 1.2.x) mod has multiple Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities in functions_navlinks.php, profile_send.php, viewtopic_PM-link.php and header_new_messages.php due to the lack of sanitization of the 'pun_user[language]' parameter. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files by manipulating the parameter. Additionally, in 'header_new_messages.php', the 'pun_user[g_pm]' and 'pun_config[o_pms_enabled]' parameters are also not properly validated leading to inclusion.",
      "root_cause": "Lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied parameters, particularly `pun_user[language]`, `pun_user[g_pm]`, and `pun_config[o_pms_enabled]` when used in `require` statements.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
         "Lack of input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary file inclusion, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or arbitrary code execution if a crafted file is included.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable scripts with manipulated parameters.",
        "The vulnerable scripts are located within the 'files/include/pms/' directory"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PunBB instance. No authentication is required."
