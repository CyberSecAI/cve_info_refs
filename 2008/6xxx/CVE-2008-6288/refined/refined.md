- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `download.php` script in ibase 2.03 is vulnerable to directory traversal due to insufficient input sanitization of the `filename` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive configuration files.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `download.php` with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the filename parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
