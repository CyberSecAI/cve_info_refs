- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the `page` GET parameter in the `pages.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameter `page` in the `pages.php` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No prior authentication may be needed, but the success may depend on the permissions set for viewing a page.
