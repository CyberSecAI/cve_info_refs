Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `vote.php` script of WSN Links. Specifically, the `id` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter in the `vote.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to access sensitive database information, such as database version, database name, and database user, as demonstrated in the provided exploit examples.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially modify or delete data in the database.
- **Remote Code Execution (potentially):** Although not directly demonstrated, SQL injection vulnerabilities can sometimes be chained with other weaknesses to achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `vote.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WSN Links instance.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft the injection payload.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit string provided is:

```
http://site.com/vote.php?id=1 UNION SELECT 1,concat_ws(0x3a,version(),database(),user()),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 LIMIT 1,1/*
```

This SQL injection payload is crafted to:

1.  **`id=1 UNION SELECT ...`**: The `id=1` part is included to have a valid query, and then `UNION SELECT` is used to append results of the attacker's injected query to the results of the legitimate query.
2.  **`concat_ws(0x3a,version(),database(),user())`**: This is the core of the exploit. It uses `concat_ws` to combine and output the database version, database name, and user in a single field using a colon `0x3a` as a separator.
3.  **`3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19`**: These are filler fields to ensure the number of columns in the injected query matches the number of columns in the original `vote.php` query, allowing the `UNION` to work.
4.  **`LIMIT 1,1`**: This selects the first row of the injected query results to return one entry of the requested data.
5.  **`/*`**: This is a comment to remove potential issues or prevent trailing code from causing issues in the query.

The provided exploit demonstrates that an attacker can successfully extract sensitive database information using this vulnerability.
