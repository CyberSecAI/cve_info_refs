Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the ability of JavaScript within a mail message to access the `documentURI` and `textContent` properties of the DOM (Document Object Model). This allowed malicious scripts to potentially extract sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted Access to `documentURI`:** The `documentURI` property reveals the URI of the document which in the case of mail messages includes the path to the user's profile, potentially exposing the user's computer account name and other sensitive information.
*   **Unrestricted Access to `textContent`:** The `textContent` property provides access to the content of the mail message including forwarded content and comments added by the forwarder allowing a malicious mail to eavesdrop on these comments and potentially reveal them to the original malicious author if that message has also been allowed to load remote content.
*  **Missing protections:** The bug report also mentions that `nsIDOM3Text.wholeText` and functions such as `*.attributes.get`, `*.getAttribute`, and `*.getAttributeNS` were also vulnerable and were not blocked previously.
*   **Reintroduction of old bug:** The bug report mentions that this vulnerability reintroduces a previously fixed issue (bug 66938), due to the lack of proper restrictions on `.textContent`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain access to the user's profile path and computer account name by exploiting the access to `documentURI`.
*   **Eavesdropping on Forwarded Messages:** Attackers could read comments added by users when forwarding messages if the forwarded message is loaded inline and javascript in mail is enabled.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Overall, this allows a malicious actor to extract sensitive user and message information without their knowledge, violating user privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Email:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted email message containing JavaScript code.
*   **JavaScript Execution in Email:** The attack relies on the email client's JavaScript engine executing the malicious script within the context of the email document.
*   **Inline Forwarding:** The attack could be triggered if a malicious email was forwarded in-line with comments, allowing the attacker to potentially steal them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Emails:** The attacker needs the capability to send emails.
*   **JavaScript in Mail Enabled:** The target user must have JavaScript enabled in their email client. This is not the default setting in Thunderbird but if it is enabled, the vulnerability could be exploited.
*  **Targeted attack:** The attacker needs to send the malicious email to a user that has javascript in mail enabled in order for the attack to work.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects SeaMonkey and Thunderbird.
*   The fix involves preventing scripts in mail messages from accessing the `documentURI` and `textContent` properties. Additionally, the fix addressed similar vulnerabilities with  `nsIDOM3Text.wholeText` and functions such as `*.attributes.get`, `*.getAttribute`, and `*.getAttributeNS`.
*   The fix was implemented in SeaMonkey 1.1.13 and Thunderbird 2.0.0.18.
*   The provided content gives more details than the initial CVE description, including the `textContent` vulnerability and the fact that it reintroduces a previous bug. It also lists other vulnerable properties and functions, which were not mentioned by the initial description.
