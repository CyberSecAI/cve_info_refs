Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `download.php` script. Specifically, the script directly uses a user-supplied `filename` parameter in file operations without sufficient sanitization or checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **File Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is an arbitrary file disclosure. By manipulating the `filename` parameter in the URL, an attacker can read the contents of any file that the web server has access to.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code snippet `if(file_exists($filename))` checks for file existence, but it does not sanitize or validate the `$filename` parameter. This allows for path traversal attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidential Information Leakage:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information by reading arbitrary files on the server, including application source code, database configurations, and potentially system configuration files.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Disclosure of source code or configuration files could reveal additional vulnerabilities, facilitating further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request with the `filename` parameter in the URL, pointing to the desired file for disclosure.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `filename` parameter within the URL to specify the path to the file they want to access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `download.php` script and its parameters.
- **Basic understanding of HTTP requests and URL manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific URL to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit-db content provides a proof of concept (PoC) URL demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability: `http://[target]/[path]/download.php?filename=[Local File]`
- It specifically highlights the ability to disclose the `index.php` file using the URL `http://www.rightscripts.com/listrearrange/download.php?filename=index.php` as a live demo.

This analysis reveals that CVE-2008-6336 is a file disclosure vulnerability caused by insufficient input validation in the `download.php` script of the "Text Lines Rearrange Script," allowing attackers to read sensitive files.
