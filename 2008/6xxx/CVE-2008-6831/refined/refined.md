Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6831:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper HTML encoding of user-controlled input in two areas:
    *   **ViewProfile Page:** The 'fullname' of a user is not HTML-escaped when the ViewProfile page is displayed.
    *   **Return URL Parameter:** The returnURL parameter within form URLs is not HTML-escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Due to the lack of HTML encoding, a malicious user can inject JavaScript code into the 'fullname' or 'returnURL', which is then executed in the browser sessions of other users who view the affected page/URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can steal user session cookies or other credentials.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By hijacking a session, an attacker could potentially gain control over the system with the hijacked user's privileges.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Malicious script injected via the returnURL parameter can be displayed on JIRA pages, potentially harming a company's reputation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious User Creation:** An attacker can create a JIRA user account with malicious JavaScript in the 'fullname' field.
*   **Crafted URLs:** An attacker can create a URL that contains malicious JavaScript within the 'returnURL' parameter, then trick users into clicking the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **JIRA Account:** The attacker needs an account within JIRA (or the ability to create one) to exploit the vulnerability via the 'fullname' field.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must rely on social engineering to get users to click on crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript in the 'returnURL' parameter.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the JIRA instance to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Additional details from content:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as **HIGH** severity by Atlassian.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in **JIRA 3.13.1**. No patches were provided for older versions.
*   The vulnerability affects JIRA instances in a public environment.
*   Mitigation steps include disabling public access to JIRA.
