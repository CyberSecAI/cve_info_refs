How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Nagios: Execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200907-15**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Nagios may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/nagios-core** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.6-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.6-r2** |

### Background

Nagios is an open source host, service and network monitoring program.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Nagios:

* Paul reported that statuswml.cgi does not properly sanitize shell
  metacharacters in the (1) ping and (2) traceroute parameters
  (CVE-2009-2288).
* Nagios does not properly verify whether an authenticated user is
  authorized to run certain commands (CVE-2008-5027).
* Andreas Ericsson reported that Nagios does not perform validity checks
  to verify HTTP requests, leading to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  (CVE-2008-5028).
* An unspecified vulnerability in Nagios related to CGI programs,
  "adaptive external commands," and "writing newlines and submitting
  service comments" has been reported (CVE-2008-6373).

### Impact

A remote authenticated or unauthenticated attacker may exploit these
vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary commands or elevate privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Nagios users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/nagios-core-3.0.6-r2"
```

NOTE: Users of the Nagios 2 branch can update to version 2.12-r1 which
contains a patch to fix CVE-2009-2288. However, that branch is not
supported upstream or in Gentoo and we are unaware whether the other
vulnerabilities affect 2.x installations.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
