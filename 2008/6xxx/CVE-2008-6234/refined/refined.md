Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw within the `com_musica` component of Mambo. The `id` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, such as user passwords, or possibly modify or delete data.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the URL when accessing `index.php?option=com_musica&Itemid=172&tasko=viewo&task=view2`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable Mambo web application and send a crafted URL request. No specific authentication is mentioned as being required.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit URL demonstrates how the vulnerability is exploited:

```
index.php?option=com_musica&Itemid=172&tasko=viewo&task=view2&id=-4214/**/union+select/**/0,0,password,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0+fro m%2F%2A%2A%2Fmos_users/*
```

This URL attempts to inject a SQL `UNION SELECT` statement that retrieves the `password` field from the `mos_users` table. The `id` parameter with a negative value is likely used to bypass an initial select query that is required to be in place to allow for the injection to succeed.

This exploit targets the `id` parameter in the com\_musica component. It attempts to perform a SQL injection by appending a `UNION SELECT` statement after a manipulated `id` value in the URL. This allows the attacker to potentially retrieve data, including password hashes, from the `mos_users` table.
