Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6581

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the authentication logic of phpAddEdit version 1.3. Specifically, the script uses a cookie named "addedit" to determine if a user is authenticated. This cookie is set based on the username provided in the login form, but there's no validation or password check tied to it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core vulnerability is that an attacker can bypass the login mechanism simply by setting a cookie with the name "addedit" and an arbitrary value (typically the admin username). The application trusts the cookie value without verifying against a password.
- **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application does not properly validate the "addedit" cookie's content, trusting it directly for authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain administrative access to the phpAddEdit application without knowing the administrator's password.
- **Full Control:** Successful exploitation would grant the attacker complete control over the application's features, including creating, modifying, and deleting forms and potentially gaining access to underlying data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Cookie Manipulation:**  An attacker can use a browser's developer tools or a scripting language (like JavaScript) to set the "addedit" cookie in their browser.
- **Network Manipulation:** It might be possible to manipulate the HTTP headers via man-in-the-middle attack to insert the cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Admin Username:** The attacker needs to know a valid username used within the application. This can often be discovered through other means or inferred.
- **Ability to Set Browser Cookie:** The attacker needs the ability to set a cookie in the browser for the target website, or by manipulating the network.
