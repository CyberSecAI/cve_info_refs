How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[September 07, 2008, 04:45:46 AM](https://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?msg=1693788 "SMF 1.1.6 and 2.0 beta 4 Released")

Last Edit: September 07, 2008, 07:13:09 PM by karlbenson

Simple Machines is happy to announce the release of SMF 1.1.6, which fixes a number of minor bugs in 1.1.5 and addresses a security vulnerability. While the vulnerability primarily affects SMF installations on Windows servers, we would like to encourage all users to upgrade as soon as possible.  A successful exploit could result in privilege escalation.

For those users running the 1.0.x and 2.0 beta branch, we have released 1.0.14 and 2.0 beta 4 respectively, addressing the above issues.

*SMF 1.0.13 users*
Use the package manager to upgrade to 1.0.14. Simply visit your admin center and follow the upgrade advice on the main page. Alternatively, you can use either of the packages on the download page.

*SMF 1.1.5 users*
Use the package manager to upgrade to 1.1.6. Simply visit your admin center and follow the upgrade advice on the main page. Alternatively, you can use either of the packages on the download page.

*SMF 2.0 beta 3, 2.0 beta 3.1 and 2.0 beta 4 (Charter Member release)*
Please upgrade to SMF 2.0 beta 4 public by using the packages from the download page. (News: [What Is New In SMF 2.0 Beta 4 Public](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=260303.0))

If you cannot upgrade using the package manager, please follow the instructions posted in the Online Manual about installing and upgrading.

Finally - please do not use this topic for any support requests. You will get a much more prompt response by visiting the relevant support board!

Regards,

Simple Machines

just upgraded my big board (2.4 million posts) which is heavily modded from 1.1.5 to 1.1.6 using the package manager link in the admin center - and it went fantastic.

The mod site needs to be updated so that authors can report compatibility with 1.1.6 and Beta 4

Very nice, thanks for all the hard work.

I'm not looking for support, but wanted to point this out.

In my Administration Center in the Live from Simple Machines... box it shows this.

SMF 1.1.6 on April 20, 2008, 09:56:14 PM

It seem to have the same time and date as when the last patch came out for SMF 1.1.5

Anyone else see this in there Administration Center or is it just me?

A couple days won't make much difference. It will take most modders that long to get familiar with 2B4 anyway. It will take a couple days before anybody upgrading to 2B4 is going to be looking for mod compatibility.

It'll probably be about an hour or two before mod support threads start filling up with the same "when will it be out?" questions. ![:P](https://smf-smileys.simplemachinesweb.com/default/tongue.gif "Tongue")

By the way, I hereby Christen the new release "2-by-4" or "2x4" or "2B4." You heard that first right here and I'm the dude that named it! ![:D](https://smf-smileys.simplemachinesweb.com/default/cheesy.gif "Cheesy")

/**
* Software site: http://www.simplemachines.org
*
* SMF leaks current state of random number generator through hidden input parameter `sc`
* of the password reminder form:
*
* $_SESSION['rand_code'] = md5(session_id() . rand());
* $sc = $_SESSION['rand_code'];
*
* Since max random number generated with rand() on win32 is 32767 and session id
* is known an attacker can reverse the md5 hash and get the random number value.
* On win32 every random number generated with rand() is used as a seed for the next
* random number. So if SMF is installed on win32 platform an attacker can predict
* all the next random numbers. When password reset is requested SMF uses rand()
* function to generate validation code:
*
* $password = substr(preg_replace('/\W/', '', md5(rand())), 0, 10);
*
* So prediction of the validation code is possible and an atacker can set his
* own password for any user.
*
* More information about random number prediction:
* http://www.suspekt.org/2008/08/17/mt_srand-and-not-so-random-numbers/

* More information about the behaviour of rand() on win32 (in Russian):

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
