Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of file extension validation in the `upload.php` script of Iamma Simple Gallery versions 1.0 and 2.0.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the absence of checks on the file extensions during the upload process. This allows users to upload files of any type, including potentially malicious ones, such as PHP scripts.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including malicious scripts. This could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, potentially allowing the attacker to gain full control of the system, deface the website, or steal sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the `upload.php` script present within the web application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the `upload.php` script and have the ability to upload files to the server. This likely requires no authentication since it's a simple file upload, and could be used by anyone who has access to the target url.

The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, specifying the vulnerable script (`upload.php`) and the lack of file extension checks.
