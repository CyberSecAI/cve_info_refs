## Vulnerability Analysis for CVE-2008-6322

Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a **Blind SQL Injection** found in the `CFMBLOG` application.
- The root cause lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `categorynbr` parameter in the `index.cfm` page.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The application directly uses the unsanitized `categorynbr` parameter in an SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The specific type of SQL injection is blind, meaning the attacker doesn't receive direct output from the database, but can infer results by observing application behavior or timing.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, application data, and other critical information.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms or manipulate application data.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to the `index.cfm` page of the `CFMBLOG` application, by manipulating the `categorynbr` parameter.
- The attacker injects SQL code into the `categorynbr` parameter, which is then executed by the database server.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges are required, the attacker can be external.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit demonstrates a blind SQL injection using the following URL:
```
http://www.cfmblog.com/index.cfm?categorynbr=2+and%20substring(@@version,1,1)=5
```
This example tries to extract a character from the database version. If the result is correct, the response of the web page will differ. Attackers can use similar queries to extract data through boolean logic and timing attacks.
