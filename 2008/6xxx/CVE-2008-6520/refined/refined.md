**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Xitami web server uses the SMT kernel (Simple Multi Threading kernel) which contains format string vulnerabilities. User-supplied data is directly passed to `vsnprintf()` and `vsprintf()` functions inside the `sendfmt()` function of the SMT kernel without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Format string vulnerability in LRWP request processing: The `tcb->rtr->name` which comes from the user input is passed to `sendfmt` leading to format string vulnerability in the logging mechanism.
- Format string vulnerability in SSI request processing: Similar to LRWP, a format string vulnerability exists when logging SSI requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
- Remote attackers may be able to execute arbitrary code on the target machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- For LRWP: Sending a specially crafted request to the LRWP service (default TCP port 81).
- For SSI: Visiting two specific URLs successively on the web server (default TCP port 80).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Xitami web server.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication.
