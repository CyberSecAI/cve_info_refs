{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to an improperly defined `ugamela_root_path` or `xnova_root_path` variable within the `includes/todofleetcontrol.php` file. This variable, intended to specify the root path of the application, is not properly initialized, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL via HTTP GET parameter to include an arbitrary file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
       "Lack of input validation/sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the vulnerable application. An attacker can include malicious files from a remote server, potentially gaining full control over the compromised system.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `includes/todofleetcontrol.php` file by setting the `ugamela_root_path` or `xnova_root_path` parameter to the location of the malicious file.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server. They also require a location to host the malicious file (e.g., a web server under their control)."
