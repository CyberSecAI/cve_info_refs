{
  "vulnerability_information": {
    "overview": "A number of authoring tools for Flash content may generate files that contain cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Any site hosting Flash generated by an affected tool could be vulnerable to cross-site scripting.",
    "root_cause": "Improperly validated user-controlled input in Flash files can execute arbitrary ActionScript and JavaScript.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to the 'asfunction' protocol which allows invoking ActionScript functions, and other types of vulnerabilities",
      "Vulnerable templates or including static Flash content in authoring tools"
    ],
    "impact": "Any website hosting Flash files generated by an affected product is vulnerable to cross-site scripting in the context of the domain hosting the vulnerable file. This could lead to spoofing or modifying web content, accessing website information such as cookies, or retrieving data from an encrypted HTTPS connection.",
    "attack_vectors": "Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code through user-controlled input, which is then executed by the Flash content.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide user-controlled input that is used by vulnerable Flash files. The attacker can then exploit this via the vulnerable Flash content."
