```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application sets a cookie named "username" with the actual username as its value instead of a secure identifier or password.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure cookie handling.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can forge a cookie with the administrator's username, potentially gaining unauthorized access or elevated privileges.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a specific cookie via JavaScript or other means to set the "username" cookie to the administrator's username.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to know the administrator's username to forge the cookie. They also need to be able to manipulate the cookie either via Javascript or direct manipulation (like a browser extension)
