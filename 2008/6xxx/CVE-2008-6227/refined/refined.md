The provided content includes details about multiple vulnerabilities in PreProject Multi-Vendor Shopping Malls, referencing both CVE-2008-6227 and CVE-2008-6228.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from insecure cookie handling and SQL injection flaws within the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Insecure Cookie Handling**: The application uses client-side JavaScript to set cookies for administrative access (`adminname` and `adminid`).
2.  **SQL Injection**: The `buyer_detail.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `prodid`, `custid`, `sid`, and `cid` parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Insecure Cookie Handling:** Exploitation allows an attacker to gain administrative access by setting the admin cookies, which may lead to full system compromise.
2.  **SQL Injection**: Allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including user credentials and database version information.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **Insecure Cookie Handling**: An attacker could inject the malicious JavaScript code into a victim's browser.
2.  **SQL Injection**: An attacker crafts malicious URLs with SQL injection payloads targeting the vulnerable `buyer_detail.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  **Insecure Cookie Handling**: The attacker needs to be able to inject client side JavaScript, or have the victim run the provided JavaScript.
2.  **SQL Injection**: The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests with manipulated parameters to the vulnerable script.
