Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `job_id` parameter within the `job-info.php` script of the Diesel Job Site application. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code directly into the query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker cannot directly see the results of the injected query. Instead, they must infer information based on the application's behavior (e.g., changes in response time or content).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the application's database. The example provided uses `@@version` to extract the database version, but other data could also be targeted.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful exploitation could lead to further malicious activities such as data modification, deletion or even gaining control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through manipulating the `job_id` parameter in the URL of the `job-info.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have basic knowledge of SQL to be able to construct the malicious queries.
*   **Understanding of Blind SQLi:** The attacker should know the techniques to exploit Blind SQLi vulnerabilities, where direct query results are not visible.

**More Details than CVE:**

*   The provided content gives a clear step-by-step Proof-of-Concept (P0C) with examples of both true and false queries to demonstrate the blind nature of the SQL injection vulnerability. It also gives a demo URL, making it easier to reproduce the exploit.
*   It shows the exact vulnerable URL and the vulnerable parameter, making it easy to understand how the vulnerability is triggered
*   It explains that the "times change each time" when the injected condition is true and "it remains stable" when the injected condition is false.
