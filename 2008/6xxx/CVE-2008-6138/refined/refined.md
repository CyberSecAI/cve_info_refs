```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application has insufficient input sanitization when handling the 'path[docroot]' and 'download' parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) via the 'path[docroot]' parameter.",
    "Remote File Disclosure (RFD) via the 'download' parameter."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server via the RFI vulnerability. The RFD vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server, which can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests with malicious values in the 'path[docroot]' or 'download' parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific positioning is needed, as the attack is launched remotely."
