  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-6936",
      "root_cause": "Arbitrary parameter injection via URI handler",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The Exodus application's URI handler allows injection of arbitrary parameters."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting a malicious URI (e.g., im:// or pres://) with injected parameters, an attacker can overwrite a file inside the Microsoft Help and Support Center folders and execute arbitrary code."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URI that includes the `-l` argument to specify the target file to overwrite, and potentially a network location to retrieve the malicious payload."
      ],
      "additional_information": "The exploit leverages the `-l` argument of the URI handler to overwrite the `msinfo.htm` file in `C:\\WINDOWS\\PCHEALTH\\HELPCTR\\System\\sysinfo\\`, which results in the execution of the attacker's payload (in this case, a VBScript that launches `calc.exe`). It requires netcat to be listening to deliver the payload. The provided exploit includes HTML links that when clicked trigger this process."
