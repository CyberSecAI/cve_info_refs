Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:** The application has insecure file upload functionality and insufficient input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files without proper validation. Specifically, the exploit details how to upload a PHP shell disguised as a GIF by prepending `GIF89a;` to the file content. This bypasses basic file type checks and enables the upload of malicious code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. The provided example demonstrates injecting a script tag into the `propid` parameter of the `view_prop_details.php` page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to complete server compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting the user to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The attacker must be a registered user to change their profile and upload a crafted malicious file disguised as an image file.
*   **XSS:** The attacker sends a malicious crafted URL containing JavaScript code to a victim, who when clicking on it will have the script executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Upload:** The attacker needs an account on the vulnerable application to access the profile editing page where the file upload feature is available.
*   **XSS:** The attacker can be remote and does not need a valid account. The attacker needs a victim to visit a specially crafted link.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit description provides specific instructions on how to craft and upload the malicious PHP file and how to access it after uploading.
*   It includes the vulnerable application name and version ("zeeproperty 1.0").
*   The exploit also provides a working XSS payload example.
*   The exploit references the use of a dork, suggesting that the vulnerable application is publicly accessible.
