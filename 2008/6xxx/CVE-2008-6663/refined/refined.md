```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The phpAuction application's `profile.php` script is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `user_id` and `auction_id` parameters.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries to extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, and email addresses, leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP GET requests to the `profile.php` page.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server, and does not require authentication.
