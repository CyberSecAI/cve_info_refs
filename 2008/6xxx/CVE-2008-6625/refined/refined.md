Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6625:

**CVE Description:**

The provided text includes the following description from Exploit-DB: "WEBBDOMAIN Polls 1.01 - Authentication Bypass". This aligns with CVE-2008-6625 which is described as an authentication bypass vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an insecure SQL query within the authentication mechanism of WEBBDOMAIN Polls 1.01. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing the SQL query for authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting malicious SQL code, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism, logging in as an administrator without providing valid credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the login form of the web-based administrative interface of WEBBDOMAIN Polls 1.01.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server hosting the WEBBDOMAIN Polls application.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a SQL injection payload that will bypass the authentication check.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit provided in the Exploit-DB entry demonstrates how to bypass the authentication:
- The username field should contain: `admin ' or ' 1=1`
- The password field can contain an arbitrary string, like `Hakxer`.

The injected SQL fragment `' or '1=1` manipulates the SQL query logic, causing the application to always return true regardless of the actual username/password, effectively bypassing the login process.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Exploit-DB entry also mentions the affected script location: `http://webbdomain.com/php/poll/poll.php` and administrative location at `http://webbdomain.com/php/poll/admin`.
- The exploit was discovered by "Hakxer" and published on November 4, 2008, which provides context to the age of this vulnerability.
