```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way the `/usr/opt/reliant/bin/hvdisp` and `/usr/opt/reliant/bin/rcvm` executables handle the RELIANT_PATH environment variable. By manipulating this variable, a local user can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Insecure handling of environment variables",
    "Privilege escalation vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to gain root privileges on the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation through a crafted executable that manipulates the RELIANT_PATH environment variable.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have local access to the system and be able to execute code. The attacker also needs to have execute permissions on either `/usr/opt/reliant/bin/hvdisp` or `/usr/opt/reliant/bin/rcvm`"
}
