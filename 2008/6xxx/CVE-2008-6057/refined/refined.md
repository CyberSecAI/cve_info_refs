{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the 'forgotpass.asp' page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Database Disclosure"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use SQL injection to modify passwords (e.g. setting all passwords to 'z3ro'). Additionally, the database file ('helpdesk2000.mdb') is directly accessible, allowing an attacker to download the entire database.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP request to the 'forgotpass.asp' page with malicious SQL commands in the 'uid' parameter.",
    "Direct HTTP request to the database file ('helpdesk2000.mdb')"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication or specific network position is required."
