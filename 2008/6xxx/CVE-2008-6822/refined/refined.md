{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The NEPT Image Uploader 1.0 does not properly validate the 'Content-Type' of uploaded files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file upload vulnerability. The application relies on the 'Content-Type' header provided by the client, which can be easily manipulated. This allows uploading of malicious PHP scripts by changing the 'Content-Type' from 'application/octet-stream' to 'image/jpeg'.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to potential complete compromise of the system, including data breaches, denial of service, and other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through a web interface. An attacker needs to intercept the upload request, modify the 'Content-Type' header, and resend the request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface and intercept and modify the HTTP request during the file upload process. No special privileges are required."
