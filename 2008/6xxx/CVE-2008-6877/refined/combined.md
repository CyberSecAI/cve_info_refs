FWIW, Zen Cart includes a .htaccess file in 'admin/includes' that
prevents remote access to any PHP files in that directory:

   [theall at lab](http://www.attrition.org/mailman/listinfo/vim):/var/www/localhost/htdocs/zencart>cat admin/
includes/.htaccess
   # $Id: .htaccess 2996 2006-02-09 00:42:17Z drbyte $
   #
   # This is used with Apache WebServers
   # The following blocks direct HTTP requests in this directory
recursively
   #
   # This does not affect PHP include/require functions
   #
   # Example: direct access to <http://server/admin/includes/application_top.php>
  will not work with the following installed

   <Files *.php>
   Order Deny,Allow
   Deny from all
   Allow from localhost
   </Files>

This file is included in 1.3.8, which CraCkEr reports as affected as
well as 1.3.7 and 1.3.8a, which is current.

As a result, the local file include issues by milw0rm 6038 / BID 30179
aren't likely to be exploitable in practice -- not only would you need
to have register_globals enabled as the advisory notes, but the target
would need to be running a web server that doesn't grok .htaccess
files or ignores them.
