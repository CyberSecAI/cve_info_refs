Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `User-Agent` header in the `mercuryboard()` function within `/global.php` and improper handling of the `active_user_agent` variable.  Specifically, the `User-Agent` header is passed to the database query without proper escaping, leading to SQL injection when the crafted User-Agent is used in a `DELETE` statement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker doesn't directly see the output of the query. Instead, they infer information by observing the timing of the server's response using the `SLEEP()` function to introduce delays.
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The `addslashes()` function used on the user agent is insufficient to prevent SQL injection. The `active_user_agent` is used in a query without further sanitation.
*   **Vulnerable Code Location:** The vulnerability is triggered in `/func/login.php` within the `DELETE` query executed at line 84. The attacker injects malicious SQL through a crafted `User-Agent` header, which becomes part of the SQL query via the vulnerable `active_user_agent` variable.
*   **Lack of Parameterized Queries:** The code directly concatenates user input into the SQL query instead of using parameterized queries, which are crucial for preventing SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials (username and password hashes) by using blind SQL injection techniques, including timing attacks with `SLEEP()`.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Once the attacker retrieves user's password hash, they could potentially log into the system using the retrieved hash.
*  **Arbitrary SQL execution**: It's possible to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP User-Agent Header:** The attacker crafts a malicious `User-Agent` header that contains SQL injection payloads. This header is sent when making a login request which eventually gets used in a SQL query.
*   **POST Request to `index.php?a=login`:** The attack requires sending a POST request to the login page (`index.php?a=login`) of the MercuryBoard application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote access:** The attacker can be a remote user of the web application.
*   **Ability to send crafted HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests with a custom `User-Agent` header.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and parameters to send malicious requests.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs some SQL knowledge to construct injection payloads.

**Additional Notes:**
The exploit code provided uses a timing based approach using `SLEEP()` function to retrieve information from the database, this is common when exploiting blind SQL injection vulnerabilities. The exploit code attempts to extract the password hash of a specific user (defaulting to user id 2, usually an admin), and demonstrates that with the retrieved hash the attacker can log into the system.

This exploit also includes a registration function to create a new user in the system in case the provided username and password doesn't work.
