```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Micro CMS application does not properly restrict access to the microcms-admin-home.php page, allowing unauthorized users to perform administrative actions.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Insecure Direct Object Reference: The application allows manipulation of administrator accounts (add, delete, change password) via direct requests to microcms-admin-home.php with specific parameters like 'action', 'administrators_id', 'administrators_password', etc., without proper authentication or authorization checks.
  - Lack of Authentication: The exploit demonstrates that administrative functions can be accessed without providing valid credentials or authenticating as an administrator.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can add, delete, or change passwords for administrator accounts, leading to complete control of the CMS.
- Attack vectors:
  - Sending crafted POST requests to the `microcms-admin-home.php` page with specific parameters.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Micro CMS instance.
  - They need to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server.
