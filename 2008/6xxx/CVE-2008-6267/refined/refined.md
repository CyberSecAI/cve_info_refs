{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter within the 'detail.php' file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or deletion. An attacker can also inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to account compromise, session hijacking or defacement.",
  "Attack vectors": {
    "SQL Injection": "By manipulating the 'id' parameter in the 'detail.php' URL with SQL injection payloads.",
     "XSS": "By manipulating the 'name' parameter in the 'detail.php' URL with javascript payloads."
   },
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, which is publicly accessible on the internet."
