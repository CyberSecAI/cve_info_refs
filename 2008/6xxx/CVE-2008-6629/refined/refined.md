```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the 'id' and 'name' parameters within the 'detail.php' script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection (SQLi) in the 'id' parameter",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the 'name' parameter"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "SQL injection allows attackers to retrieve database information, potentially including usernames and passwords. XSS allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser, leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests to the 'detail.php' script with crafted 'id' parameter to exploit SQLi",
    "HTTP GET requests to the 'detail.php' script with crafted 'name' parameter to exploit XSS"
    ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific position in the network is required, suggesting the attack can be performed remotely."
