Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6913

**Vulnerable Software:** Zeeways ZeeJobsite 2.0

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure file upload mechanism within the ZeeJobsite 2.0 application. Specifically, the application does not properly validate file types, allowing users to upload arbitrary files, including executable PHP scripts, as "profile pictures".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary weakness is the ability to upload files of any type, bypassing intended restrictions.
*   **Lack of File Type Validation:** The application fails to verify that uploaded files are indeed images or other expected file types.
*   **Executable File Upload:** The ability to upload executable PHP scripts allows for remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP script (web shell) and then execute it on the server, gaining complete control over the web application and potentially the underlying server.
*   **Website Defacement:** An attacker could upload a malicious HTML file or use the RCE to deface the website.
*   **Data Theft:** Once an attacker has remote code execution, they can access sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could use the compromised site to distribute malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out by utilizing the web-based profile editing feature for jobseekers.
*   **File Upload Form:** Specifically, the "photo" upload functionality is exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to register as a jobseeker on the ZeeJobsite platform.
*   **Access to Profile Editing:** The attacker needs access to the profile editing functionality for registered users, specifically the photo upload option.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic web knowledge to craft malicious php script.
* **Knowledge of file properties**: The attacker needs to right-click and view file properties of the uploaded file in order to get the URL to the uploaded file

**Exploit Details:**
1.  **Registration:**  The attacker first registers on the site.
2.  **Malicious PHP Script:** The attacker crafts a PHP script containing malicious code, prepended with "GIF89a;" to trick the system into thinking it's a GIF image.
3.  **Profile Editing:**  After logging in, the attacker navigates to their profile editing section.
4.  **File Upload:** The malicious PHP script is uploaded as their profile picture.
5.  **Shell Access:** The attacker obtains the link to the uploaded file which follows a predictable naming convention. Accessing the link in a browser executes the php shell.

This exploit provides a remote code execution vulnerability using a web shell, allowing attackers to gain control of the web server and the application.
