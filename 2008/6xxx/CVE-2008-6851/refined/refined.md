The provided content relates to CVE-2008-6851.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection flaw in PHPLD version 3.3.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `name` parameter of the `page.php` script. The application's configuration of `magic_quotes_gpc = Off` and `register_globals = On` exacerbates the issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including user passwords. The attack uses boolean-based blind SQL injection which allows an attacker to determine if the SQL statement is true or false. This allows the attacker to extract database content character by character.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the `page.php` script, specifically the `name` parameter:

```
GET http://site/phpld/page.php?name=(validpagename)' or 1=1#
```
The attacker manipulates the `name` parameter to inject malicious SQL queries, using boolean conditions to determine true/false and exfiltrate data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application. They do not need any special privileges and can conduct the attack remotely. They need knowledge of a valid pagename in order to start.
