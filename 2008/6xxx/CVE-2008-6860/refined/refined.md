  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure cookie handling",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application uses a cookie to store user authentication information, and this cookie can be manipulated by the user to gain administrator access.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain administrator access to the application without needing valid credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed client-side by manipulating the cookie value via JavaScript.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser session.  No prior authentication is required, as the vulnerability is an authentication bypass."
