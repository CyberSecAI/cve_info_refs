**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the RakhiSoftware Shopping Cart, specifically within the `product.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `category_id` and `subcategory_id` parameters in the `product.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries into the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:**  An attacker can use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords. The provided exploit demonstrates retrieval of the admin's username and password by using a `UNION SELECT` statement.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  Successful SQL injection could allow an attacker to modify data, escalate privileges, or potentially gain control of the entire server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by manipulating the URL parameters within an HTTP GET request. The vulnerable parameters are `category_id` and `subcategory_id` in `product.php`.
*   **Malicious SQL Query Injection:** The attacker injects specially crafted SQL code into the URL parameters. For example, they inject a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft the malicious queries.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit example uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve the username and password from the `admin` table by concatenating the username and password fields.
*   The application is identified as "Prince Comparison Script : Shopping card".
*   The exploit was originally published on milw0rm.com on 2008-11-27.
