- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `software-description.php` script when handling the `id` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability. Specifically, a UNION-based SQL injection is present.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive database information, potentially including usernames, passwords, or other application-related data. The attacker can also potentially modify database contents.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the URL of the `software-description.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs a web browser and the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication or special access is needed to perform this attack.
