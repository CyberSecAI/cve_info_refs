```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Insecure cookie handling. The application only checks for the existence of the cookies `xecms_username` and `xecms_password` and not their content.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Authentication bypass due to insecure cookie handling.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can gain administrative access by crafting valid cookies. Once logged in as an administrator, they can upload a shell via the admin panel's file upload functionality.
- Attack vectors: The attacker crafts cookies using javascript and sets them for the vulnerable domain.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to execute javascript in the context of the vulnerable application.
