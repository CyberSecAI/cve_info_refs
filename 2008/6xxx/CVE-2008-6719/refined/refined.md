{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper authentication checks, allowing direct access to administrative pages without logging in.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Authentication bypass"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Full administrative access to the application, potentially allowing an attacker to modify or delete data, compromise user accounts, or upload malicious files.",
  "Attack vectors": "Directly accessing administrative pages via their URLs without prior authentication.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know or guess the URLs of the administrative pages and have network access to the vulnerable server."
