Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-6068:

**Verification:**

*   The content from exploit-db.com explicitly mentions **CVE-2008-6068** in relation to a **SQL Injection vulnerability** in the **Joomla! Component JoomlaDate 1.2**. This aligns with the basic structure of a CVE entry, which involves a vulnerability identifier and description.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `user` parameter within the `viewProfile` task of the JoomlaDate component. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into database queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including usernames, passwords, and other user-related information.
    *   In more severe cases, this could potentially lead to full database compromise and control over the application and server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request targeting `index.php` with specific `option`, `task` and `user` parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Joomla application. No special privileges are required beyond this.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) URL:
    ```
    http://localhost/[Joomla_Path]/index.php?option=com_joomladate&task=viewProfile&user={SQL}
    ```
*   It shows an example of how to exploit this with a SQL injection:
    ```
    http://localhost/[Joomla_Path]/index.php?option=com_joomladate&task=viewProfile&user=9999999 UNION SELECT user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),concat(username,0x3a,password),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user() FROM jos_users--
    ```
    This example attempts to extract usernames and passwords by leveraging `UNION SELECT` to inject a malicious query.

**Additional Notes:**
* The secunia.com content does not directly provide vulnerability details but rather promotes their vulnerability intelligence services. It does not provide additional information about CVE-2008-6068.

**Summary:**

CVE-2008-6068 is a SQL injection vulnerability in the JoomlaDate component of Joomla, where unsanitized user input in the `user` parameter allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries. The impact of this vulnerability includes unauthorized access to sensitive data and potentially full database compromise. The attack can be performed remotely with a crafted HTTP request.
