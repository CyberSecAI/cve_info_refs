```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a vulnerable SQL query in the authentication process within `apoll/admin/index.php`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input in the username field.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the admin panel. An attacker can log in as any user or admin.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects SQL code into the username field via a web interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs access to the login page (e.g., `http://localhost/apoll/admin/index.php`) of the vulnerable application."
