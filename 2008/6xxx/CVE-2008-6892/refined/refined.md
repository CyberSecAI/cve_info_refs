```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input passed through the `rubid` parameter in the `index.php` and `lire/index.php` scripts.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the database, data modification, or complete system compromise.
- Attack vectors: By manipulating the `rubid` parameter in the URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
