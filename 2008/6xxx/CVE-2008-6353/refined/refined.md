Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `index.asp` file of ASP-CMS version 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `cha` parameter in the URL, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Exposure: Attackers can use this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database such as usernames and passwords from the `CMS_USERS` table.
- Potential Data Modification/Deletion: Although the provided exploit focuses on data retrieval, a successful SQL injection could potentially allow for modification or deletion of data within the database, depending on the database user's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests: The exploit is carried out by crafting malicious URLs that include SQL injection payloads in the `cha` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable ASP-CMS application.
- No specific user level access is needed, the vulnerability can be triggered via the URL.
- No specific network position is necessary, the attacker can be remote.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement in the URL parameter `cha`. The exploit uses a negative number (`-999`) to ensure no results from the original query are returned and then injects the `UNION SELECT` to return data from the `CMS_USERS` table.
- Example URLs provided to extract username and password from the database:
  - `http://Site/[path]/index.asp?cha=-999%20union%20select%200,1,user_username,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10%20from%20CMS_USERS`
  - `http://Site/[path]/index.asp?cha=-999%20union%20select%200,1,user_password,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10%20from%20CMS_USERS`
