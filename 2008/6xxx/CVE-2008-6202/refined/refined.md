Based on the provided content, here's the analysis:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-6202

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the `urun.asp`, `bayi_listele.asp`, and `urun_grup_listele.asp` files, which allows for SQL injection. The code snippet `id=Request.QueryString("id")` and the SQL query `SQL="select * from sepet where id="&"id"`  demonstrate how the user-controlled input `id` is directly concatenated into the SQL query, creating a vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by manipulating the `id` parameter in various ASP pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords (`kadi`, `sifre` columns are targeted in the provided exploits) and other confidential information from tables such as `bayi`, `sepet`, `siparis`, `siparis_urun`, `urun`, `urun_grup`, and `yonetici`
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to the application by accessing administrator accounts
- **Potential Data Manipulation:** Although not explicitly demonstrated, SQL injection could lead to data modification or deletion as well.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The attacks are carried out via crafted HTTP GET requests to vulnerable ASP pages. Attackers inject SQL code into the `id` parameter.
- **URL Parameters:** Specifically, `id` parameter of `urun.asp`, `bayi_listele.asp`, and `urun_grup_listele.asp` files are the entry point for the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to construct HTTP GET requests and inject malicious SQL code into URL parameters.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker should have a basic understanding of SQL syntax to construct effective injection payloads.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit examples provide specific URLs and payloads to extract data from the database, showcasing the severity and ease of exploitation.
- The `Dork` field and the error code example help illustrate the vulnerability's presence in the application.
- The exploit examples target the `yonetici` (admin) table to retrieve usernames and passwords.
- The application uses ASP.
- The vulnerable application is called CoBaLT v1.0
