```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize file uploads, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including PHP scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary File Upload",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the web application and potentially the server itself. XSS vulnerability allows execution of malicious scripts in victim's browser.",
  "Attack vectors": {
     "Arbitrary File Upload": "An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image (using GIF89a header) through the profile picture upload feature. Then the attacker can access the uploaded script using the direct link, leading to remote code execution.",
     "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `propid` parameter of the `view_prop_details.php` page. This script will be executed when a user visits the crafted link."
  },
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to register an account on the vulnerable website. Then, the attacker needs to access the profile edit page and upload malicious file. For XSS, the attacker needs to craft a special URL and trick a victim to access it."
