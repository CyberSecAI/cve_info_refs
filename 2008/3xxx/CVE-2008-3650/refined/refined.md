- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unescaped output in the object browser and the contact view.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the lack of output sanitization/escaping in the object browser and contact view.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the affected areas. This could potentially allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, steal session cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, etc.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is via crafted input into the object browser or contact view, which, when rendered by the application, executes the injected script in the victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Horde Groupware Webmail Edition to exploit this vulnerability.
