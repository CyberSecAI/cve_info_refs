The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde Groupware
Webmail Edition version 1.1.1.

This is a security release that fixes unescaped output in the object browser
and the contact view. The holes are only exploitable by authenticated users.

Horde Groupware Webmail Edition is a free, enterprise ready, browser based
communication suite. Users can read, send and organize email messages with
three different webmail interfaces and manage and share calendars, contacts,
tasks and notes with the standards compliant components from the Horde
Project.

The major changes compared to the Horde Groupware Webmail Edition version 1.1
are:
     * Escape item names in the object browser.
     * Escape names in the contact view.
     * Missing MDB2 driver have been added.
     * Select db before queries in MySQL SessionHandler.
     * Format messages sent through MIME_Mail in flowed text format.
     * Fixes for SQL shares with split read/write databases, and various fixes
       for hierarchical shares.
     * Workaround broken IE behavior when downloading files with 8-bit
filenames.
     * Fix storing of unlocked preferences set by hooks.
     * Allow Horde memcache driver to use UNIX sockets.
     * Fix parsing of addresses in headers when the RFC 2047-encoded personal
       part of the address contains address list delimiters.
     * Fix generation of unique keys in configuration for machines too fast for
       microtime().
     * Added group driver for Kolab.
     * Added IMAP based preferences driver for Kolab.
     * Fix missing timestamp variable in Horde SQL cache driver.
     * Fix over-zealous preference caching when preferences are requested for a
       different user.
     * Fix issue in Horde_Image that caused errors when performing
certain image
       operations immediately after an image had been cropped when using the
       ImageMagick driver.
     * Improved importing of phone numbers.
