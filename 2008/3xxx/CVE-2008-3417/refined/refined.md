Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3417:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `r` parameter of the `index.asp` file within FipsCMS Light 2.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `r` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries could potentially lead to other malicious actions, such as modifying database records, or in some cases, gaining further access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the `index.asp` page, specifically manipulating the `r` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing prior authentication or access to the server.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and SQL syntax to craft a malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**
*   The exploit code provided in the exploit database entry demonstrates how to use `UNION SELECT` statements to extract the usernames and passwords from the `admin` table.
*   The vulnerable URL pattern is: `victim/path/home/index.asp?w=pages&r=[SQL injection payload]`.
*   The exploit examples are:
    *   `victim/path/home/index.asp?w=pages&r=9999999 union select all 0,username,null,0x1 from admin`
    *   `victim/path/home/index.asp?w=pages&r=9999999 union select all 0,password,null,0x1 from admin`

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit targets FipsCMS Light 2.1, which is an older application.
*   The exploit database entry contains other search terms/information for locating potentially vulnerable instances of FipsCMS light, such as `inurl:"fipsASP 2003 - 2008"`.
*   The `secunia.com` content does not provide any information about this specific CVE, instead it talks about their vulnerability research services.

In summary, CVE-2008-3417 is an SQL injection vulnerability in FipsCMS Light 2.1 that could allow a remote attacker to extract sensitive database information.
