{
  "CVE-2008-3274": {
    "Description": "IPA installations exposed the Kerberos master password through anonymous queries to the LDAP server.",
    "Root cause": "The master Kerberos password was stored in LDAP in a way that allowed retrieval through anonymous queries.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure storage of the master Kerberos password",
      "Lack of proper access control on LDAP entries containing sensitive data"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exposure of the Kerberos master password, which is used to encrypt keys. While this does not directly expose user keys, it could be combined with another vulnerability to reveal user credentials.",
    "Attack vectors": "Anonymous LDAP queries to the IPA server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send anonymous LDAP queries to the IPA server. No authentication is required."
  }
