| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c0)  Josh Bressers    2008-08-04 20:45:18 UTC  ``` IPA contains a flaw in where installations of freipa/RHEIPA exposed the Master Kerberos Password through anonymous queries.  The Master Kerberos Password is used to encrypt keys, however this flaw does not lead to individual keys being exposed.  By itself this flaw has limited scope, but could be combined with a different flaw which could reveal user credentials.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c1)  Josh Bressers    2008-08-19 19:31:15 UTC  ``` Simo,  Any update on this?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c2)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-19 20:27:04 UTC  ``` We have almost all pieces ready. Still testing the latest scripts on various configurations.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c3)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-19 22:27:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314591](attachment.cgi?id=314591&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314591&action=edit) Make our plugin reload the master key every time  This patch allows a smooth transition greatly reducing the risk that a password change being performed during the data re-encryption is stored with the wrong key.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c4)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-19 22:28:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314592](attachment.cgi?id=314592&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314592&action=edit) Script that allows people to change the master key  This tool is part of the fix for the security issue. It generates a new random master key and re-encrypts all the data in the directory with the new master key.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c5)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-19 22:29:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314593](attachment.cgi?id=314593&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314593&action=edit) Fixies install scripts for new installations  This is the code fix for new installations   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c6)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-19 22:31:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314594](attachment.cgi?id=314594&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314594&action=edit) Script to help admins handle the security problem  This script is optional but should make the life of admins dealing with the problem much easier. It is a trhow-away script targeted to closing this specific vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c7)  Chandrasekar Kannan    2008-08-19 23:33:01 UTC  ``` why is this bug logged against product "Security Response" ? Do you mind if I move it to product "Red Hat Enterprise IPA" ? or would you prefer that I create a separate bug ?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c8)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-20 12:25:57 UTC  ``` As long as the bug does not become public and bressers is ok with that I am fine either way, as long as we don't start commenting in 2 separate places.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c9)  Josh Bressers    2008-08-20 12:36:55 UTC  ``` I will create an IPA bug.  the only purpose for that bug should be for checking things into CVS though.  All comments and relevant information belongs in this bug.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c11)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:49:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314983](attachment.cgi?id=314983&action=diff "Makes the dirsrv plugin fetch the master key at each password change") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314983&action=edit "Makes the dirsrv plugin fetch the master key at each password change") Makes the dirsrv plugin fetch the master key at each password change   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c12)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:49:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314984](attachment.cgi?id=314984&action=diff "The dump utility may set the expiration date to 0 which is a special value to be ignored or the account will stop working") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314984&action=edit "The dump utility may set the expiration date to 0 which is a special value to be ignored or the account will stop working") The dump utility may set the expiration date to 0 which is a special value to be ignored or the account will stop working   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c13)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:50:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314985](attachment.cgi?id=314985&action=diff "The dump utility may set some flags that produced invalid keys, comment out offending paths") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314985&action=edit "The dump utility may set some flags that produced invalid keys, comment out offending paths") The dump utility may set some flags that produced invalid keys, comment out offending paths   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c14)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:52:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314986](attachment.cgi?id=314986&action=diff "Utility functions needed by the scripts used to close the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314986&action=edit "Utility functions needed by the scripts used to close the issue") Utility functions needed by the scripts used to close the issue   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c15)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:52:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314987](attachment.cgi?id=314987&action=diff "Utility to change the master key") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314987&action=edit "Utility to change the master key") Utility to change the master key   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c16)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:53:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314988](attachment.cgi?id=314988&action=diff "Source fixes for new installations") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314988&action=edit "Source fixes for new installations") Source fixes for new installations   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c17)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:54:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314989](attachment.cgi?id=314989&action=diff "Auxiliary utility to help administrators to close the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314989&action=edit "Auxiliary utility to help administrators to close the issue") Auxiliary utility to help administrators to close the issue   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c18)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:55:17 UTC  ``` Attached the new patches committed to RHEIPA 1.0 after backporting from the master tree and testing on RHEL5   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c19)  Josh Bressers    2008-09-10 18:00:53 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c20)  Fedora Update System    2008-09-12 05:13:45 UTC  ``` ipa-1.1.0-4.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c0)  Josh Bressers    2008-08-04 20:45:18 UTC  ``` IPA contains a flaw in where installations of freipa/RHEIPA exposed the Master Kerberos Password through anonymous queries.  The Master Kerberos Password is used to encrypt keys, however this flaw does not lead to individual keys being exposed.  By itself this flaw has limited scope, but could be combined with a different flaw which could reveal user credentials.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c1)  Josh Bressers    2008-08-19 19:31:15 UTC  ``` Simo,  Any update on this?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c2)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-19 20:27:04 UTC  ``` We have almost all pieces ready. Still testing the latest scripts on various configurations.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c3)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-19 22:27:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314591](attachment.cgi?id=314591&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314591&action=edit) Make our plugin reload the master key every time  This patch allows a smooth transition greatly reducing the risk that a password change being performed during the data re-encryption is stored with the wrong key.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c4)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-19 22:28:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314592](attachment.cgi?id=314592&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314592&action=edit) Script that allows people to change the master key  This tool is part of the fix for the security issue. It generates a new random master key and re-encrypts all the data in the directory with the new master key.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c5)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-19 22:29:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314593](attachment.cgi?id=314593&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314593&action=edit) Fixies install scripts for new installations  This is the code fix for new installations   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c6)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-19 22:31:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314594](attachment.cgi?id=314594&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314594&action=edit) Script to help admins handle the security problem  This script is optional but should make the life of admins dealing with the problem much easier. It is a trhow-away script targeted to closing this specific vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c7)  Chandrasekar Kannan    2008-08-19 23:33:01 UTC  ``` why is this bug logged against product "Security Response" ? Do you mind if I move it to product "Red Hat Enterprise IPA" ? or would you prefer that I create a separate bug ?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c8)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-20 12:25:57 UTC  ``` As long as the bug does not become public and bressers is ok with that I am fine either way, as long as we don't start commenting in 2 separate places.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c9)  Josh Bressers    2008-08-20 12:36:55 UTC  ``` I will create an IPA bug.  the only purpose for that bug should be for checking things into CVS though.  All comments and relevant information belongs in this bug.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c11)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:49:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314983](attachment.cgi?id=314983&action=diff "Makes the dirsrv plugin fetch the master key at each password change") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314983&action=edit "Makes the dirsrv plugin fetch the master key at each password change") Makes the dirsrv plugin fetch the master key at each password change   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c12)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:49:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314984](attachment.cgi?id=314984&action=diff "The dump utility may set the expiration date to 0 which is a special value to be ignored or the account will stop working") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314984&action=edit "The dump utility may set the expiration date to 0 which is a special value to be ignored or the account will stop working") The dump utility may set the expiration date to 0 which is a special value to be ignored or the account will stop working   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c13)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:50:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314985](attachment.cgi?id=314985&action=diff "The dump utility may set some flags that produced invalid keys, comment out offending paths") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314985&action=edit "The dump utility may set some flags that produced invalid keys, comment out offending paths") The dump utility may set some flags that produced invalid keys, comment out offending paths   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c14)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:52:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314986](attachment.cgi?id=314986&action=diff "Utility functions needed by the scripts used to close the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314986&action=edit "Utility functions needed by the scripts used to close the issue") Utility functions needed by the scripts used to close the issue   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c15)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:52:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314987](attachment.cgi?id=314987&action=diff "Utility to change the master key") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314987&action=edit "Utility to change the master key") Utility to change the master key   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c16)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:53:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314988](attachment.cgi?id=314988&action=diff "Source fixes for new installations") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314988&action=edit "Source fixes for new installations") Source fixes for new installations   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c17)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:54:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 314989](attachment.cgi?id=314989&action=diff "Auxiliary utility to help administrators to close the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=314989&action=edit "Auxiliary utility to help administrators to close the issue") Auxiliary utility to help administrators to close the issue   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c18)  Simo Sorce    2008-08-26 12:55:17 UTC  ``` Attached the new patches committed to RHEIPA 1.0 after backporting from the master tree and testing on RHEL5   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c19)  Josh Bressers    2008-09-10 18:00:53 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=457835#c20)  Fedora Update System    2008-09-12 05:13:45 UTC  ``` ipa-1.1.0-4.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

RHSA-2008:0860 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2008-09-10
Updated:
2008-09-10
# RHSA-2008:0860 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: ipa security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated ipa packages that fix a security flaw are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise IPA.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise IPA is an integrated solution to provide
centrally-managed Identity (machines, users, virtual machines, groups,
authentication credentials), Policy (configuration settings, access control
information) and Audit (events, logs, analysis) services.

A flaw was found in the Red Hat Enterprise IPA installation procedure. The
master Kerberos password was set up in the LDAP server in such a way that
it was possible to retrieve the password via an anonymous LDAP connection.
(CVE-2008-3274)

Note: the master Kerberos password is used to encrypt keys. This flaw does
not lead to individual keys being exposed.

Users of Red Hat IPA should upgrade to these updated packages and perform
the operations explained in the solution to resolve this issue.

## Solution

To fully resolve this problem, you need to manually perform the following
steps after installing the updated packages:

Disclaimer: The following procedure performs critical, low-level operations
on your IPA system, and it is imperative that you back up your system
before carrying out any of the following steps. A failure during this
procedure may compromise the readability of all or part of your Kerberos
keys.

1. Upgrade all of your servers (masters and replicas) and restart the
dirsrv service on all of them. No other daemon needs to be restarted at
this stage.

2. On one master server, run the following tool:
 $ ipa-fix-2008-3274 --check

This should report that the system is vulnerable.

3. On the same master server, run the following tool:
 $ ipa-fix-2008-3274 --fix

This should dump all Kerberos principals, reload them, and then return a
message stating that the operation completed successfully. If not, you
should contact Red Hat GSS for immediate assistance.

This step should also create a .gpg file symmetrically-encrypted with the
Directory Manager password. This file contains a backup of all Kerberos
key material and is written to /var/lib/ipa/.

Attention: DO NOT RUN THIS COMMAND ON ANY OTHER SERVER. See the next step.

4. On all other IPA servers, run the following tool:
 $ ipa-fix-2008-3274 --fix-replica

This will report that the system is NOT vulnerable and will then download
the master key for the local KDC instance. This command will restart the
KDC service.

If the command reports a system as anything other than not vulnerable,
verify that replication between masters is working correctly. The procedure
will not successfully complete until replication failures are addressed.

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# CVE-2008-3274[#](#cve-2008-3274 "Link to this heading")

## CVE-2008-3274[#](#id1 "Link to this heading")

We have been recently notified that a flaw in out installation procedure
that causes the disclosure of the Kerberos master key to anonymous users
directly searching the LDAP server.

Note: the master Kerberos password is used to encrypt keys. This flaw
does not lead to individual keys being exposed.

The disclosure itself can be fixed by applying a simple ACI. Of course
once exposed a secret cannot be trusted anymore. To address this issue
we have developed a set of tools that can be used to operate master key
change.

Please carefully follow the instructions to fix your existing
installations.

## Upgrade Instructions[#](#upgrade-instructions "Link to this heading")

To fully resolve this problem, you need to manually perform the
following steps after installing the updated packages:

Disclaimer: The following procedure performs critical, low-level
operations on your IPA system, and it is imperative that you back up
your system before carrying out any of the following steps. A failure
during this procedure may compromise the readability of all or part of
your Kerberos keys.

1. Upgrade all of your servers to the freeipa-1.1.1 (or later) code and
restart the dirsrv service on all of them. No other daemon needs to be
restarted at this stage.

2. On one master server, run the following tool as root:

`` # /usr/sbin/ipa-fix-CVE-2008-3274 –check``

This should report that the system is vulnerable.

3. On the same master server, run the following tool as root:

`` # /usr/sbin/ipa-fix-CVE-2008-3274 –fix``

This should dump all Kerberos principals, reload them, and then return a
message stating that the operation completed successfully.

This step should also create a .gpg file symmetrically-encrypted with
the Directory Manager password. This file contains a backup of all
Kerberos key material and is written to /var/lib/ipa/.

Attention: DO NOT RUN THIS COMMAND ON ANY OTHER SERVER. See the next
step.

4. On all other IPA servers, run the following tool as root:

`` # /usr/sbin/ipa-fix-CVE-2008-3274 –fix-replica``

This will report that the system is NOT vulnerable and will then
download the master key for the local KDC instance. This command will
restart the krb5kdc service.

If the command reports a system as anything other than not vulnerable,
verify that replication between masters is working correctly. The
procedure will not successfully complete until replication failures are
addressed.
