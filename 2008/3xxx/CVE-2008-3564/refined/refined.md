{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes user-controlled input in file paths without proper sanitization, allowing for directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "Directory Traversal",
    "Improper Input Validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by exploiting the LFI vulnerability. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as configuration files, passwords, or source code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the 'cat', 'p', or 'archive' GET parameters in the `index.php` file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required."
