## CVE-2008-3277

The provided content relates to CVE-2008-3277.

### Root cause
The `ibutils` packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 were built with an insecure relative RPATH in the ELF header of the `ibmssh` command. The vulnerability was caused by using `$prefix` instead of `$(prefix)` in `ibmgtsim/src/Makefile.*`.

### Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities
Insecure relative RPATH in the `ibmssh` executable.
Affected binary: `/usr/bin/ibmssh`
RPATH: `refix/lib`

### Impact of exploitation
A local attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code as another user. This requires convincing a victim user to run the `ibmssh` command in a directory controlled by the attacker, containing specially crafted content.

### Attack Vectors
Local attacker convinces a victim to execute `/usr/bin/ibmssh` in a directory controlled by the attacker. The attacker crafts malicious content that will be loaded due to the insecure RPATH.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
*   Local access to the system.
*   Ability to create and control a directory.
*   Ability to convince another user to execute a specific command (`ibmssh`) within the attacker-controlled directory.
