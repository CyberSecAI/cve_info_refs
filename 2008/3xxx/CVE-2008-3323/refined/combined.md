Cygwin Installation and Update Process can be Subverted Vulnerability
http://www.security-objectives.com/advisories/SECOBJADV-2008-02.txt
AFFECTED: Cygwin setup.exe 2.573.2.2
PLATFORM: Intel / Windows
CLASSIFICATION: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345)
RESEARCHER: Derek Callaway
IMPACT: Client-side code execution
SEVERITY: Medium
DIFFICULTY: Moderate
REFERENCES: CVE-2008-3323, RedHat Bugzilla Bug 449929
BACKGROUND
Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows. It consists of two parts:
1. A DLL (cygwin1.dll) which acts as a Linux API emulation layer providing
substantial Linux API functionality.
2. A collection of tools which provide Linux look and feel.
SUMMARY
Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Microsoft Windows copyrighted by
Red Hat, Inc. Tarball software packages are installed and updated via
setup.exe. This program downloads a package list and packages from
mirrors over plaintext HTTP or FTP. The package list contains MD5
checksums for verifying package integrity. If a rogue server answers the
HTTP request responsible for package updates and responds with a
modified MD5 string setup.exe will download and install a malicious package.
ANALYSIS
To successfully exploit this vulnerability an attacker must be able to
somehow position themself such that they can impersonate a Cygwin mirror.
As a proof-of-concept the local hosts file was modified but an attack
that occurs in the wild can be accomplished through DNS cache
poisoning, ARP redirection, TCP hijacking, impersonation of a Wi-Fi
Access Point, etc. The attacker also would have configured a rogue web
server to push out package code of their choosing. The success of
attacks that utilize the DNS cache poisoning approach has recently been
compounded by Kaminsky's birthday paradox technique (CVE-2008-1447.)
For testing purposes, gzip was used as the malicious package although
any and all packages can be trojanned (including base-files.) gzip was
chosen for testing purposes because it is so common. A real attacker
would probably target more of a lynchpin package like bash. The version,
time, size, and MD5 sum of the gzip entry in the setup.ini file was
modified for the rogue Cygwin server. The location of the altered gzip
package was /sourceware/cygwin/release/gzip/gzip-3.1.33-7.tar.bz2.
When setup.exe is executed it will automatically download the modified
package from the rogue server. /usr/bin/gzip was replaced by /usr/bin/ls
during Security Objectives' testing. In a real attack scenario bash
could be trojanned or a complete rootkit could be installed. The user is
likely to not even notice the malicious package being setup as it is
auto-selected for installation.
WORKAROUND
Refrain from using Cygwin setup.exe versions prior to 2.573.2.3.

# Updated: Setup.exe updated to version 2.573.2.3

* *From*: "Dave Korn" <dave dot korn at artimi dot com>
* *To*: <cygwin-announce at cygwin dot com>
* *Date*: Tue, 5 Aug 2008 14:30:12 +0100
* *Subject*: Updated: Setup.exe updated to version 2.573.2.3

```

  I've updated the version of setup.exe at <<http://cygwin.com/setup.exe>> to
version 2.573.2.3.

  This version incorporates major new security-related features and
a number of bug fixes, as listed below.

  No action is required by maintainers of standard Cygwin mirrors, but
maintainers of customised package repositories will need to take action.
Please see the "Custom Mirrors" section below for more information.

SECURITY ISSUES
===============

  This release fixes the security vulnerability CVE-2008-3323 identified by
Derek Callaway of Security Objectives.[1][2][3]  Derek observed that there
was no protection against either a corrupt mirror or a DNS hijacker or other
MitM feeding a modified setup.ini file to setup.exe and thereby causing it
to download and install a maliciously-modified package tarball.

  To verify that users are not fed a malicious setup.ini, we have instituted
GPG signing of setup.ini, setup.bz2, and their -1.7 equivalents on the
Cygwin.com website.  Setup.exe now contains a public key, and verifies any
of the setup index files it downloads against that key.  If an index file
fails to verify, or no .sig file is present on the mirror, setup.exe refuses
to accept the untrusted index file.

  By guaranteeing that setup.exe only accepts genuine index files, we can
guarantee the md5sums in those index files are untampered; as setup.exe
verifies the md5sums of downloaded packages against those indicated in the
setup index file and rejects any that don't match as corrupt downloads,
Cygwin users are protected against a malicious mirror attempting to
manipulate either/and/or/both package tarballs and setup index files.

  The public key used in signing these files is appended below; it can be
cut and pasted from this email into "gpg --import" at the command-line.  It
can also be used to verify setup.exe itself, which is also signed on
cygwin.com.[4]

  If we, from time to time, need to change this key, we will release a new
version of setup.exe and make announcements on the cygwin and
cygwin-announce mailing lists, and on the cygwin.com website.

CUSTOM MIRRORS
==============

  Maintainers of standard mirrors of the upstream cygwin.com/sourceware.org
public repository need take no action.  There will be no impact from these
changes apart from the presence of the new .sig files alongside the existing
setup.ini/setup.bz2 et. al.

  Maintainers of customised repositories will be impacted.  Read on for
details and mitigation.

  Without taking action, the new version of setup.exe will refuse to install
from your repositories when it fails to find a valid signature for your
customised setup.ini files.  There are a number of option open to you and
your users to deal with this situation.

  Unfortunately this is only the first release of this feature and currently
requires the use of command-line options to modify the
signature-verification behaviour; we apologise for the pressure of time and
manpower resources that has not allowed us to develop more user-friendly
features initially, and would like to work with package repository
maintainers to improve the usability of future versions of setup.exe for
them and their users.  Please direct suggestions for improved mechanisms,
bug-reports, and (especially!) offers of help to the cygwin-apps list.

  This list summarizes the main possibilities, in decreasing order of
worstness:

1)  Tell your users that they must retain and use an old version of
setup.exe to access your mirror.  This old version will not complain about
the lack of signature files.

2)  Tell your users to supply the new -X (--no-verify) command-line flag
when using setup.exe to download from your mirror.  This can be added into
the command-line invocation in a Windows shortcut, for convenience.

3)  Start signing your custom-generated setup.ini and setup.bz2 files with
gpg, and either

-   i)  Convert your public key to s-expr format using the script
gpg-key-to-s-expr.sh from the setup.exe sources[5] (requires an installation
of pgpdump[6]), distribute it to your users, and ask them to specify it as
the argument to the -S command-line option (can be done using a shortcut to
save repetition).
-  ii)  Convert your public key to s-expr format, distribute it to your
users, and tell them either to use the -S option once to load it into the
untrusted keys cache and the -U option subsequently.
- iii)  Distribute your public key file to users in binary gpg format, and
tell them to use the -K command-line option to point at it, either every
time, or just initially to load it into the untrusted keys cache, followed
by use of -U on subsequent occasions.

  We're aware that this is not entirely convenient, but the security relies
on users to only knowingly accept keys; if we had setup.exe just look for a
key file on the mirror itself, it would no longer protect against a corrupt
mirror.  We look forward to working with you to make it more convenient for
both you and your users.

NEW FEATURES
============

-  Signature verification of setup index files.

NEW COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
========================

 -X --no-verify                         Don't verify setup.ini signatures
 -K --pubkey                            Path to extra public key file (gpg
                                        format)
 -S --sexpr-pubkey                      Extra public key in s-expr format
 -u --untrusted-keys                    Use untrusted keys from
                                        last-extrakeys
 -U --keep-untrusted-keys               Use untrusted keys and retain all

MINOR BUGFIXES
==============

-  Revert to using the original "setup_9x.ini" filename for (no-longer
supported) Win9X installations.

-  Fix for potential crash with missing package-cache files.

-  Fix for crashes caused by corrupted package listing files.

-  Fix for potential double-free crash bug.

CYGWIN SETUP SIGNING PUBLIC KEY
===============================

  This is the public half of the key used to sign Cygwin setup files.  It
can be used to verify your initial download of setup.exe from the Cygwin
website; download the .sig file and the .exe to the same directory, and run

    gpg --verify setup.exe.sig

from a Bash or other shell command-line.  You can import the key to your gpg
keyring by running

    gpg --import

and then cutting and pasting the public key block below directly into your
shell, or you can save this message to a text file and run

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=449929#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2008-06-04 10:29:44 UTC  ``` Derek Callaway from Security Objectives contacted the Red Hat Security Response Team on 25th May 2008 to report a security issue with Cygwin.  "Tarball software packages are installed and updated via setup.exe. This program downloads a package list and packages from mirrors over plaintext HTTP or FTP. The package list contains MD5 checksums for verifying package integrity. If a rogue server answers the HTTP request responsible for package updates and responds with a modified MD5 string setup.exe will download and install a malicious package."  He included a proof-of-concept and stated that he notified vulnerability co-coordinator iDefense about this issue.  iDefense responded that they did not consider this a vulnerability because "The installer prompts you to select a repository, and it is clear that HTTP/FTP is being used. Any site that allows a user to download applications over HTTP allows for similar attacks. "  But Derek disagrees and his company plans to publish a formal advisory stating that the download mechanism used by Red Hat is insecure.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=449929#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2008-06-04 10:33:25 UTC  ``` Brendan wrote: Packages and package lists are unsigned- there is no authentication provision in Cygwin packaging- just md5sums to ensure archive integrity.  The Cygwin installer uses FTP/HTTP, and is about as secure (The document calls for the use of DNS spoofing, ARP redirection, TCP hijacking, etc).  A proper fix would require signed packages and installer authentication (In other words, a complete redesign of the Cygwin packaging system).   DJ wrote: The original protocol wasn't intended to provide authentication.  It just downloaded files off the Internet, like any other free software / open source project.  The MD5 checksums aren't authentication, they only check against mistransmitted files.  (Users) who are concerned about security may use their own authentication mechanisms to download the files to a local mirror, then use setup to update from there.  Adding a secure authentication mechanism on top of cygwin's distribution mechanism would be a considerable effort, I don't think we could justify it as part of our net-release maintainership.  I also suspect that needing to sign each package would deter other contributors.  Perhaps we could just sign the file containing the MD5 signatures?     ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=449929#c3)  Brendan Conoboy    2008-06-05 18:27:46 UTC  ``` DJ and I discussed further (Corinna is still on PTO)- We can conceivably link in OpenSSL to the setup program, allowing HTTPS or other PKI options.  Package signing, or md5 list signing are options, but tricky.  Most packages come from community members.  While some of us have an armchair understanding of crypto issues, we require advice from the SRT to create a sensible policy.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=449929#c4)  Chris Faylor    2008-06-08 17:31:13 UTC  ``` Is this being reported for official Red Hat distributions of cygwin? It isn't clear that the original reporter understands that <http://cygwin.com/> is not Red Hat.  If this is in reference to the public project, where setup.exe is maintained by people outside of Red Hat, isn't this a problem for every other package distributed from sourceware.org/gcc.gnu.org? Nearly every tarball that you download contains a shell script which could be subverted.  And, then you could start worrying about the packages distributed by sourceforge.  However, if Red Hat is volunteering to add SSL support, that would be a welcome addition.  I'd just like to have the changes reviewed by the setup.exe maintainers.  I can't force anyone to do this work but I will ping a couple of the developers about it.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=449929#c5)  Dave Korn    2008-06-09 13:55:34 UTC  ```   Hi, for any here who don't know me, I'm one of the cygwin maintainers for setup.exe and I'm here to help.  I also have some security and crypto background and I'm willing to contribute patches to implement signature verification in setup.exe to help resolve this.    I have a couple of questions:   - Is there an official channel/liaison we should use to communicate with the reporter?  It might be helpful to discuss potential mitigation strategies with him.  I would understand if RH want to manage the external communications.   - Can someone perhaps attach to the PR, or send me in private mail, a copy of the actual report from Mr. Callaway and the PoC he offered?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=449929#c9)  Dave Korn    2008-06-13 11:02:30 UTC  ``` FTR, I have just sent Derek the following email after discussions between the setup maintainers off-list about the best approach to fix this problem:  [CC'd Brian Dessent, Corinna Vinschen, Chris Faylor]  Received: from ALBATROSS ([192.168.8.39]) by mail.artimi.com with Microsoft SMTPSVC(6.0.3790.3959); 	 Fri, 13 Jun 2008 11:58:43 +0100 From: "Dave Korn" <dave.korn AT artimi.com> To: "'Derek Callaway'" <decal AT security-objectives.com>, 	<dave.korn+cygwin AT artimi.com> Cc: <me AT cgf.cx>, 	<corinna AT cygwin.com>, 	"'Brian Dessent'" <brian AT dessent.net> References: <000301c8ca91$1ca938e0$55fbaaa0$@com> Subject: RE: Cygwin Vulnerability Information Date: Fri, 13 Jun 2008 11:58:43 +0100 Message-ID: <030c01c8cd44$71ee6c20$2708a8c0.COM> MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain; 	charset="us-ascii" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit X-Mailer: Microsoft Office Outlook 11 In-Reply-To: <000301c8ca91$1ca938e0$55fbaaa0$@com> Thread-Index: AcjKkRuzwL8RukMrRyyPa809ACc1owCsMpvQ X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V6.00.2900.3198 Return-Path: dave.korn X-OriginalArrivalTime: 13 Jun 2008 10:58:43.0275 (UTC) FILETIME=[71EAE9B0:01C8CD44]  Derek Callaway wrote on 10 June 2008 01:30:  > Greetings all, >  >  >  >                I was referred to you by Mark Cox.

Hi again Derek,    We've designed (and I've begun implementing) a scheme that we hope will close the loopholes in the cygwin distribution mechanism.  Please let us know if you agree this should be watertight:  -  Implement code-signing of setup.exe.  This should guarantee the integrity of setup.exe and therefore of the public key we will embed in it.  -  Sign all new versions of setup.ini and setup.[bz2](show_bug.cgi?id=2 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - broken links of default index.html") with the corresponding private key when released.  -  Setup.exe will verify the signature of setup.ini/[bz2](show_bug.cgi?id=2 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - broken links of default index.html") that it downloads and refuse to proceed if it isn't valid.  -  Verification of setup.ini guarantees the integrity of its contents and hence of the enclosed md5sums for the distributed packages.  -  Verifying the md5sums the guarantees that the packages haven't been tampered with.     We believe this will prevent the kinds of interception or corruption of, or tampering with the packages distributed via the mirrors that you have identified in your advisory.    Note that we are aware that md5 is a weak checksum, but as far as we understand the current state-of-the-art would require an attacker to control creation of both the original file and a malicious variant, and that it is not yet simple to modify an arbitrary file in a way that allows controlled contents to be inserted while matching the original md5.    However we still propose to address this in a second stage of work where we will extend the setup.ini grammar to allow us to use stronger hashes or even keyed HMACs.     Do you need more details?  I imagine you'd like some idea of a schedule?  By good fortune I happen to have a few days off work, and I'm able to dedicate myself to this full time.  I'd expect to have a beta version of the new setup.exe available by the other side of the weekend and wonder if you'd like to help by testing it against your PoC setup?      cheers,       DaveK --  Can't think of a witty .sigline today....    ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=449929#c10)  Dave Korn    2008-06-17 12:26:02 UTC  ``` For the audit record: I have created setup_crypto_branch in the cygwin-apps repository and implemented code-signing on HEAD; I have backported the fix to the release branch (not yet committed) and prepared a snapshot of it, and I have circulated email (appended) to let Derek Callaway know that we've got something for him to test.

Hi again Derek.  I've now prepared the fix and placed a copy of the new setup.exe on the cygwin website in the test directory: <http://cygwin.com/setup/snapshots/>    The executable is <http://cygwin.com/setup/snapshots/setup-2.573.2.2.exe> and the source is in <http://cygwin.com/setup/snapshots/setup-2.573.2.2.tar.bz2>     The executable isn't code-signed yet, but it is feature-complete and of beta quality.  Can you confirm for us that it fixes the vulnerability demonstrated in your advisory and PoC?       cheers,       DaveK --  Can't think of a witty .sigline today....    ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=449929#c13)  Mark J. Cox    2008-07-22 14:30:46 UTC  ``` Added reporter, Derek Callaway, to this bug.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=449929#c14)  Derek Callaway    2008-07-22 15:42:33 UTC  ``` Hello all,  I am the original reporter. Sorry for the delayed response. I have been on the road lately and just returned from the Last HOPE conference. I tried testing the attack against an early snapshot of 2.573.2.2 but there was a bug where it was not including a forward slash in concatenated download URL's. I've since tested 2.573.2.3 and it appears to be resistant against my proof-of-concept code, although there still seems to be something weird going on with the forward slash appendage (there are two slashes before the filename in the URL being downloaded.)   Mark,  There are a lot of open source (and commercial) projects that are implementing secure software update mechanisms nowadays. Both Debian APT and Gentoo's Portage Tree implement GPG signing of their packages and Mozilla Firefox uses SSL. IIRC, the BSD's digitally sign their portages as well. Also, the success of attacks that utilize the DNS cache poisoning approach has recently been compounded by Kaminsky's birthday paradox technique ([CVE-2008-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-1447).) I've published a blog post about this subject on my company's blog at <http://systemofsystems.wordpress.com/2008/05/25/updating-the-updater/>   Chris,  I understand that Cygwin is not part of the RedHat Linux distribution but how exactly is RedHat affiliated with Cygwin? I see this at the bottom of the cygwin.com web page, "Cygwin DLL and utilities are Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 Red Hat, Inc."

I don't work for Red Hat.  See: <http://cygwin.com/licensing.html>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=449929#c16)  Chris Faylor    2008-07-22 15:51:06 UTC  ``` Also note that setup.exe and the software which generates the package lists is pure GPL and not owned by Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=449929#c17)  Dave Korn    2008-07-22 16:08:15 UTC  ``` > I've since tested 2.573.2.3 and it appears to be resistant against my > proof-of-concept code, although there still seems to be something  > weird going on with the forward slash appendage (there are two slashes > before the filename in the URL being downloaded.)  Nothing weird, just lazy coding; we don't bother to test whether the supplied URL ends with a slash before appending the relative URI to the setup ini files.  I have an (unverified) memory that the rfc says this is valid syntax, albeit non-canonical; in practice we haven't seen any servers that complain about it, and the only place in POSIX where '//' doesn't just mean an empty (null, ignored) path component is at the root of the FS, and nobody should have their webroot pointed there!  I'll tidy it up when I get a spare minute, just for neatness' sake.    ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=449929#c18)  Derek Callaway    2008-07-24 06:04:22 UTC  ``` So if Cygwin isn't RedHat then why is this bug being discussed on RedHat's Bugzilla? Also, is there a timeframe for the release of the new setup.exe version?   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=449929#c19)  Mark J. Cox    2008-07-24 09:06:49 UTC  ``` > So if Cygwin isn't RedHat then why is this bug being discussed on RedHat's > Bugzilla?  There is currently no private list used by the Cygwin developers, and therefore they had no place to discuss a private issue.  I set up this bug to help track the issue through completion.     ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=449929#c20)  Derek Callaway    2008-07-25 16:06:35 UTC  ``` Hey everyone..

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
