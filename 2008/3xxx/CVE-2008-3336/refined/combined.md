#### Topic: PunBB 1.2.19

PunBB 1.2.19 released.
The only differ from 1.2.18 is fixing improper attempt to solve an XSS issue in include/parser.php.
We apologize for hurrying up with 1.2.18 release, having not enough testing.

We assume most users are upgrading from PunBB version 1.2.17 or lower, so
here is the **1.2.17 to 1.2.19 changelist**:

* Fixed an SMTP command injection vulnerability, discovered by Stefan Esser.
* Fixed an XSS issue in include/parser.php, discovered by Dan Crowley.
* Fixed issue with database returning the same user on multiple pages of the userlist, noticed by hcgtv.
* Fixed several potential XSS vectors in moderate.php.
* Fixed the avatars of deleted users not being removed.
* Copyrights and punbb.informer.com links updated.
* Docs removed.

It is strongly recommended to update your PunBB 1.2.\* installations to PunBB 1.2.19 as soon as possible.
Visit [Downloads page](http://punbb.informer.com/downloads.php) for archives and the patch. Or get latest revision from [SVN trunk](http://punbb.informer.com/svn/punbb/trunk/).

Thanks to the people who reported issues and Smartys who fixed them.

Please no more future updates that only change the copyright year.

Copyrights do not have to have the year, they can just say
**copyright punbb**
and thats it.

That would save a lot of us, lots of headaches. I use a lot of hacks on my forum and dont like having to compare all my files. THanks.

Agree, but we couldn't leave Rickard's copyrights untouched as this is legally incorrect now. I hope these notices will not be changed for a long time anymore )

### PunBB 1.3.4

**PunBB 1.3.4** has been released. The main change since 1.3.3 is the fix of the possible XSS vulnerability in profile.php on password and e-mail change (reported by Richard Sammet). As usual, the hotfix for older versions is released as well, which resolves the same security issue.
If, for the reason of possible incompatibility of styles and extensions, you have not upgraded to 1.3.3 yet, you may also get along without upgrading to 1.3.4.

**Downloads:** get PunBB 1.3.4 on [Downloads page](https://punbb.informer.com/downloads.php#1.3.4) or via [Subversion repository](https://punbb.informer.com/svn/punbb/tags/punbb-1.3.4/).

Posted on 2009-05-20 | [Comments](/forums/topic/21669/punbb-134/)

### PunBB 1.3.3

**PunBB 1.3.3** is released. 1.3.2 to 1.3.3 changes:

* a lot of bugs fixed (CSS & markup, defects in language files, correct response header placement upon errors, hook rearrangements, parsing posts in feeds, correct language pack detection during the final stage of the install process);
* contains fixes of security flaws (which were fixed by hotfixes in previous versions);
* it is now possible to limit searches to topic subjects or message bodies;
* users are not allowed to change their e-mails without entering their passwords first.

The already existing styles and language packs should be checked for compatibility with the version 1.3.3 before the latter is installed. After checking, the version 1.3.3 may be installed.

### PunBB.Net beta has been released!

We've been working on this project for quite a long time, trying to do our best to create a completely new product, but one that users are already
familiar with. Now we are glad to present new PunBB.Net beta!

PunBB.NET is a forum written using the ASP.NET technology.

This forum is simple, fast and lightweight. The forum's core itself is only a basis, which allows attaching various extensions to it. This makes it
possible for you to have a discussion board, which can be fine-tuned to meet all your requirements prefectly.

PunBB.NET is inspired by PunBB, being its child project. Both these forums utilize similar layouts and functionality, and they both are released under the GPL license.

The main difference between PunBB.NET and PunBB lies in the technology of their implementation.

PunBB.NET beta is the first public version of PunBB.NET.

For more details visit [PunBB.NET page](https://punbb.informer.com/wiki/punbb.net/start).

* a possible [SQL-injection in the the admin users page](https://punbb.informer.com/wiki/punbb13/bugs#potential_sql-injections_at_adminusers.php_page).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
