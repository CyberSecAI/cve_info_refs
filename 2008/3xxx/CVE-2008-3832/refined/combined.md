# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Subject: CVE-2008-3832 kernel: null pointer dereference in utrace_control

Michael Simms reported that it is possible for an unprivileged user to
crash the machine by running gdb on a running process with pid 1.

This affects the version of utrace as shipped with Fedora 8 and 9. This
is addressed in kernel-2.6.26.5-28 for Fedora 8, and kernel-2.6.26.5-45
for Fedora 9. This issue is specific to Fedora, and does not affect
upstream or any of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernels.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=464883#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-10-01 00:44:07 UTC  ``` Reported by Michael Simms:  Any user can crash init with a single command  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Fedora 9, patched to latest as of 90 minutes ago  How reproducible: Always. May have to run the command 2-3 times but it always crashes the kernel in the end.  Steps to Reproduce: 1.as ANY user - start a shell 2.gdb any_executable 1 3.There will be a kerneloops and usually a kernel crash or hang  Actual results: Kernel blows up  Expected results: Kernel doesnt blow up, permission denied for process init  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=464883#c1)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-10-01 00:46:42 UTC  ``` Thanks Michael.
