{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Kshop module's search functionality doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input for the search variable and field, leading to an XSS vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who interact with the vulnerable search functionality, potentially leading to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing the malicious script in the search variable and/or field. This can be delivered via phishing emails or links on other websites."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and then convince a user to click on the URL or have the URL be opened in the context of a user session. This could be achieved remotely, meaning the attacker does not need any special privileges on the web server."
