Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `show.php` file of PHPFootball version 1.6, specifically related to the `dbtable` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (`dbtable` parameter) before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords (which are stored as MD5 hashes).
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Potentially, an attacker could modify or delete data.
*  **Complete System Takeover:** Although not explicitly stated, SQL injection vulnerabilities can, in some scenarios, lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `show.php` script.
*   **Manipulated `dbtable` parameter:**  The attacker injects SQL code into the `dbtable` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only requires network access to the vulnerable web application and ability to send HTTP GET requests.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to know SQL to create a malicious injection.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit example shows how an attacker can use `UNION SELECT` to extract data from the `Accounts` table using this URL:
    ```
    www.Target.com/show.php?dbtable=Predictions+UNION+SELECT+0,Concat_Ws(0x3a,Username,Password)MrSQL,0,0,0+FROM+Accounts--
    ```
*   The exploit utilizes `Concat_Ws` function to combine the `Username` and `Password` fields with a separator.
*   The passwords are noted as being stored as MD5 hashes.
