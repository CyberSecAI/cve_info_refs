Applications such as Safari and others use Download Validation to help warn users prior to launching files marked as potentially unsafe. This update adds to the list of potentially unsafe types. It adds the content type for files that have executable permissions and no specific application association. These files are potentially unsafe as they will launch in Terminal and their content will be executed as commands. While these files are not automatically launched, if manually opened they could lead to the execution of arbitrary code. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5.

### Some Random Safari Notes

I got to take a quick look at some Safari stuff at work a few days ago, and came away with a few notes that I thought might interest people about Safari:

Cross-Site Cooking works the same way as it does in Firefox 2.0, namely it works just as the RFC describes and we can set cookies for .co.uk, .com.au, etc.

HttpOnly is not supported.

Safari parses Set-Cookie headers like the RFC says, which means that cookies are comma separated (no other browsers seem to do this), which means that in ASP.NET and JSP, when you use the framework's method of setting cookies and you let the user control the value, they can inject arbitrary cookies by specifying something like ", arbitrary\_name=arbitrary\_value" as the cookie value.

Referers are not leaked from https to http, but are leaked from one https site to another https site.

The safari cache (at lest on windows) is an SQLite database where all the data is double hex encoded; it looks something like X'aabbccddeeff, etc, and when you strip the first two chars and decode it you get another blob which looks identical to the first one, which you then need to decode the same way and you get an XML document with the data, I wrote this dodgy PHP function to do the conversion for me: (you need to call it twice on the blob you extract from the database)

````
function decode_blob ($blob) {
 $ret = "";
 for ($i=2,$c=strlen($blob);$i<$c;$i+=2) {
  $ret .= chr(hexdec ($blob[$i].$blob[$i+1]));
 }
 return $ret;
}
````

On the iPhone (emulator at least; I didn't get to use an actual iPhone), the last character of the password field is shown before you type the next one in (and untill the field loses focus); this makes sense since it's hard to type on iPhones, but it's still curious.

Safari on the iPhone (emulator, again) doesn't seem to actually close, so unless you close the emulator (I'm assuming this is equivalent to turning off your iPhone; if that's even possible), all session cookies persist.

Hope that helps someone.

Wow, security though obscurity with that SQLlite encoding! or is this normal behavior? I can't see any reason why they should do this other than preventing strange locales/entities being injected into that XML file, but even that sounds strange if I hear myself uttering that. :)

Any thoughts why they do this? it's a pretty interesting aka weird approach.

It seemed a bit odd to me as well, and I have no idea why they did that, I doubt it was meant to be security through obscurity since it's usually the first thing you try when you see some random digits...

I doubt it's to stop injection attacks since the whole xml file is encoded, but other than that I'm just as confused as anyone.

P.S. I was using sqliteman to view the database, not sure if that makes any difference though.

P.P.S. I remember the URLAndExit stuff (though I didn't know what it was) from way back when Kazaa was the shit (for me at least); you always got random media files which opened websites to try and get you to install malware, or just to do advertising. :)

Your php function is a bit too long. I would write the same this way :
function decode\_blob ($blob) {
 return pack('H\*', substr($blob, 2));
}

Hope it helps ;)

# Apple Updates for Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedOctober 19, 2016
Alert CodeTA08-350A

### Systems Affected

Systems running Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server

### Overview

Apple has released Security Update [2008-008](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT3338) and Mac OS X version 10.5.6 to correct multiple vulnerabilities affecting Apple Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code, gain access to sensitive information, or cause a denial of service.

Apple Security Update [2008-008](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT3338) and Apple Mac OS X version 10.5.6 address a number of vulnerabilities affecting Apple Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server versions prior to and including 10.4.11 and 10.5.5. The update also addresses vulnerabilities in other vendors' products that ship with Apple Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server.

### Impact

The impacts of these vulnerabilities vary. Potential consequences include arbitrary code execution, sensitive information disclosure, denial of service, or privilege escalation.

### Solution

Install Apple Security Update [2008-008](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT3338) or Apple Mac OS X version 10.5.6. These and other updates are available via [Software Update](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1338?viewlocale=en_US) or via [Apple Downloads](https://support.apple.com/downloads/).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
