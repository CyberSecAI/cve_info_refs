  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-3906",
      "root_cause": "The Sys.Web DLL in Mono is vulnerable to HTTP header injection attacks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "HTTP header injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious HTTP headers, potentially leading to various attacks such as session fixation, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other forms of malicious manipulation of the HTTP response.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack is performed by manipulating the input to the vulnerable application to inject malicious HTTP headers. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the way user input is processed when building HTTP headers within the Mono Sys.Web library."
      ],
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to provide input to the vulnerable application to inject malicious headers. This means they would need to interact with a web application that uses the vulnerable Sys.Web library."
