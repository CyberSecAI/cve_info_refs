{
  "CVE-2008-3644": {
    "Description": "Disabling autocomplete on a form field may not prevent the data in the field from being stored in the browser page cache. This may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information to a local user.",
    "Root cause": "The browser's autocomplete feature does not properly clear form data from the browser page cache when autocomplete is disabled for a form field.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate data clearing from cache",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact": "Sensitive information entered into a form field may be disclosed to a local user accessing the same system if the data is stored in the browser's page cache.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to a machine with a browser that has previously visited a page containing the vulnerable form.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs local console access to the system after a user has previously interacted with the vulnerable form."
