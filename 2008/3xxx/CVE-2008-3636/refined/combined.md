# We believe in

Wirecore is a Estonian private company created to manage its own assets. The company's goal is to preserve, diversify and increase equity capital with well balanced risk.

# OurPrinciples

* Use of own capital only
* For our investments, we do not attract capital from outside, we use only the ownerâs capital

* Pure origin of money
* All capital at our disposal has a clean, fully traceable origin from risk-free sources

* Diversification
* We carefully diversify capital by investing both in very low-risk assets, such as real estate, and in high-risk short-term trading operations, such as foreign exchange markets

* Well balanced risks
* For high-risk transactions, we use a very small part of the capital, preferring to store most of the capital in the form of highly liquid assets that are constantly rising in price

* Only bona fide counterparties
* We carefully select only the best partners and always check where the money comes from, avoiding all sources even with potential risks

# CounterpartiesInteraction

**We interact with counterparties in just a few situations:**

* - buying or selling real estate
* - buying or selling other property
* - renting out real estate
* - property maintenance
* - brokers for trading operations

# About the security content of iTunes 8.0

This document describes the security content of iTunes 8.0, which can be downloaded and installed via [Software Update](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106704) preferences, or from [Apple Downloads](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/).

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see "[How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25314)."

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see "[Apple Security Updates](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61798)."

#### iTunes 8.0

* **iTunes**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3634

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11

  Impact: Firewall warning dialog in iTunes is misleading

  Description: When the firewall is configured to block iTunes Music Sharing and the user enables iTunes Music Sharing in iTunes, a warning dialog is displayed which incorrectly informs the user that unblocking iTunes Music Sharing doesn't affect the firewall's security. Allowing iTunes Music Sharing or any other service through the firewall inherently affects security by exposing the service to remote entities. This update addresses the issue by refining the text in the warning dialog. This issue does not affect systems running Mac OS X v10.5 or later. Credit info to Eric Hall of DarkArt Consulting Services, Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **iTunes**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3636

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: A local user may gain system privileges

  Description: A third-party driver provided with iTunes may trigger an integer overflow, and could allow a local user to obtain system privileges. Credit to Ruben Santamarta of Wintercore for reporting this issue.

IMPORTANT SECURITY INFORMATION

It has come to our attention that despite our best efforts and regular 3rd party security reviews, a
security vulnerability has been found within the GEAR ASPI drivers which are used in all of GEAR’s
products as well as many ‘GEAR Powered’ products.

The issue was reported by a third party security consultant who demonstrated how the GEAR ASPI
drivers could be used to exploit a vulnerability in the kernel of all NT based systems including
Microsoft Windows XP and Microsoft Vista. At this time, no known malware or malicious software is
known to exploit this vulnerability.

To resolve this issue, GEAR Software, in cooperation with CERT, has released an updated driver set
which can be downloaded from:

http://www.gearsoftware.com/support/drivers.cfm.

These new drivers are fully backwards compatible with our previous releases and therefore can be
updated without the need to update any software applications which may use them.

## Gear Software CD DVD Filter driver privilege escalation vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#146896

Original Release Date: 2008-10-07 | Last Revised: 2008-10-07

---

### Overview

The Gear Software CD DVD Filter driver contains a privilege escalation vulnerability, which can allow an attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges.

### Description

| Gear Software provides a driver called CD DVD Filter, which is provided by GEARAspiWDM.sys. This driver is used by multiple CD/DVD recording applications. The Gear Software CD DVD Filter driver allows unlimited calls to IoAttachDevice from a user-space application. By making multiple calls to IoAttachDevice, an attacker may be able to exploit an integer overflow in the Microsoft Windows kernel to execute code with SYSTEM privileges. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to execute code with SYSTEM privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue is addressed in GEAR driver version 4.001.7, which provides GEARAspiWDM.sys version 2.0.7.5. This version of the CD DVD Filter driver limits the number of IoAttachDevice calls that can be made. Please check with your software vendor for updates that contains this fixed driver. If no update is available, the stand-alone driver from GEAR may be installed.Apple iTunes users should install iTunes 8.0, as specified in the [About the security content of iTunes 8.0](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3025) document.Symantec customers using Norton 360, Norton Ghost, Norton Save and Restore, Backup Exec System Recovery, and Symantec LiveState Recovery should apply an update, as specified in the Symantec Security Advisory [SYM08-017](http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/2008.10.07a.html). |
