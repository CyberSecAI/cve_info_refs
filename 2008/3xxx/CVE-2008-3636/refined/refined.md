Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2008-3636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within a third-party driver provided with iTunes, specifically the GEAR ASPI driver (GEARAspiWDM.sys) which is a CD/DVD filter driver.
- The driver allows unlimited calls to `IoAttachDevice` from a user-space application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** Making excessive calls to `IoAttachDevice` triggers an integer overflow within the Microsoft Windows kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local user can exploit the integer overflow to gain SYSTEM privileges on the affected Windows system. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the highest level of permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable driver is installed.
- **User-Space Application:** The vulnerability is triggered by a user-space application making calls to the vulnerable driver. This means a malicious or compromised application can exploit the flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to run an application on the targeted Windows system that can interact with the vulnerable GEAR ASPI driver.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is confirmed to affect Windows XP and Vista.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ruben Santamarta of Wintercore.
- The fix involves limiting the number of `IoAttachDevice` calls to prevent the integer overflow, implemented in version 2.0.7.5 of the GEARAspiWDM.sys driver.
- Affected software includes Apple iTunes, and various Symantec products such as Norton 360, Norton Ghost, Norton Save and Restore, Backup Exec System Recovery, and Symantec LiveState Recovery. Updates for these products are necessary to address the vulnerability.
