CVE-2008-3222: Session fixation vulnerability in Drupal 5.x before 5.8 and 6.x before 6.3, when contributed modules "terminate the current request during a login event," allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions via unknown vectors.
```

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Drupal handles user sessions during login events when certain contributed modules interrupt the request flow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Session Fixation:** User sessions are not properly regenerated when a contributed module terminates the current request during login, making it possible to fixate the session.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** A malicious user can control another user's initial session ID. If the session is not regenerated properly after the victim authenticates, the attacker can use the 'fixed' session ID to gain unauthorized access to the victim's account.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered when contributed modules terminate the current request during a login event, preventing Drupal from regenerating the user's session ID. This allows an attacker to set a known session ID for a victim prior to the victim logging in.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence a user's initial session ID and must have knowledge or control of a contributed module that terminates the request during login.
- The attacker needs to be able to make the user login while they control their initial session ID.
