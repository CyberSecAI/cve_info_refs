  "affected_vendors": [
    "EMC"
  ],
  "affected_products": [
    "ApplicationXtender Workflow"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems with vulnerable installations of EMC ApplicationXtender Workflow Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists in the Admin Agent service (aws_tmxn.exe) which listens by default on TCP port 2606. The process receives network packet data into a static heap buffer. Exploitation allows remote attackers to corrupt heap memory subsequently leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
  "root_cause": "Heap overflow in the Admin Agent service (aws_tmxn.exe) due to insufficient bounds checking when receiving network packet data into a static heap buffer.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Heap overflow",
    "Insufficient bounds checking"
  ],
  "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Network (Remote)"
  ],
  "required_capabilities": [
    "Ability to send network packets to port 2606 of the vulnerable server"
  ],
    "additional_details": "Both issues have been addressed by a hotfix available from EMC AX Support. To obtain the hot fix contact EMC AX Support at 1-877-534-2867 and reference EMC AX Support issue CQOTG00074151",
