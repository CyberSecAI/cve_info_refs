Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3386:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `album.php` script of Alstrasoft Video Share Enterprise version 4.5.1.
*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `UID` parameter in the `album.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the `UID` parameter, leading to unauthorized database access and manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers could modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** A successful SQL injection could be a stepping stone for more severe attacks, such as remote code execution if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `album.php` script.
*   **Manipulated URL Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `UID` parameter in the URL to inject SQL commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the server. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit shows how to inject a SQL `UNION` statement via the `UID` parameter.
*   The example payload `?UID=-58+UNION+SELECT+1,2,version(),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31--` shows how to retrieve the database version, a common tactic used in SQL injection attacks.
*   The provided example shows what table and column names an attacker might find useful.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit is confirmed to be remote.
*   The vulnerability is present in `album.php`, and possibly other scripts (`view_picture.php`).
*   The provided content includes a `milw0rm.com` reference, which is an old security advisory archive.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a classic SQL Injection, allowing remote, unauthenticated attackers to access or modify the database by injecting SQL code via the `UID` parameter in `album.php`.
