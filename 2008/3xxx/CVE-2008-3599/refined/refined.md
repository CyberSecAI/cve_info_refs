Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3599

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `image.php` file of OpenImpro version 1.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, allowing for malicious SQL code to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass authentication and potentially gain access to sensitive data within the database, including usernames, passwords (likely hashed but still sensitive).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `image.php`, injecting malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `image.php` script of the OpenImpro installation.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit string is `target.com/image.php?id=-1 union select 1,2,concat(firstname,0x3a,lastname,0x3a,password),4,5,6 from im_person --`
- This specific exploit attempts to extract user information from the `im_person` table by concatenating `firstname`, `lastname`, and `password` fields. The retrieved information will be included in the HTTP response, which can be saved as a file and viewed using a text editor.
