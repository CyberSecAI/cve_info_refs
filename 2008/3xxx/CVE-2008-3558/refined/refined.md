Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3558

**Description:**
The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `NewObject()` method of the `WebexUCFObject` ActiveX control, which is part of Cisco WebEx Meeting Manager.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a stack buffer overflow in the `NewObject()` method within the `atucfobj.dll` file, which is the `WebexUCFObject` ActiveX control. This occurs because the `NewObject()` method does not properly validate the size of the input buffer, allowing an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack buffer overflow in the `NewObject()` method of the `WebexUCFObject` ActiveX control.
- Some versions of the ActiveX control are not marked as Safe For Scripting, which can affect exploitability in certain scenarios.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious content.
- Attackers can gain complete control over the user's machine if the exploit is successful.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation is achieved by convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document, such as a web page, an HTML email, or attachment, containing malicious JavaScript that triggers the overflow in the ActiveX control.
- This can be accomplished by hosting the malicious HTML page on a website or sending an email that includes the malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be able to deliver a crafted HTML document to the target user.
- They do not need prior authentication.
- Successful exploitation requires knowledge of the vulnerable ActiveX control and its `NewObject()` method, as well as understanding of buffer overflows.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco WebEx Meeting Manager, specifically versions WBS 23, WBS25, and WBS26.
- A fixed version of atucfobj.dll is distributed when users join a meeting on a server with updated software (version 26.49.9.2838 for WBS 26).
- The ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for CLSID: `{E06E2E99-0AA1-11D4-ABA6-0060082AA75C}`.
