Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-0041 CVE-2008-3903 CVE-2009-3727 CVE-2008-7220 CVE-2009-4055 CVE-2007-2383
Debian Bug     : 513413 522528 554487 554486 559103

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in asterisk, an Open Source
PBX and telephony toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-0041

It is possible to determine valid login names via probing, due to the
IAX2 response from asterisk (AST-2009-001).

CVE-2008-3903

It is possible to determine a valid SIP username, when Digest
authentication and authalwaysreject are enabled (AST-2009-003).

CVE-2009-3727

It is possible to determine a valid SIP username via multiple crafted
REGISTER messages (AST-2009-008).

CVE-2008-7220 CVE-2007-2383

It was discovered that asterisk contains an obsolete copy of the
Prototype JavaScript framework, which is vulnerable to several security
issues. This copy is unused and now removed from asterisk
(AST-2009-009).

CVE-2009-4055

It was discovered that it is possible to perform a denial of service
attack via  RTP comfort noise payload with a long data length
(AST-2009-010).

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenny1.

The security support for asterisk in the oldstable distribution (etch)
has been discontinued before the end of the regular Etch security
maintenance life cycle. You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to
stable.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1:1.6.2.0~rc7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2009-003

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | SIP responses expose valid usernames |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Information leak |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote Unauthenticated Sessions |
| **Severity** | Minor |
| **Exploits Known** | No |
| **Reported On** | February 23, 2009 |
| **Reported By** | Gentoo Linux Project: Kerin Millar ( kerframil on irc.freenode.net ) and Fergal Glynn < FGlynn AT veracode DOT com > |
| **Posted On** | April 2, 2009 |
| **Last Updated On** | April 2, 2009 |
| **Advisory Contact** | Tilghman Lesher < tlesher AT digium DOT com > |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2008-3903 |

| **Description** | In 2006, the Asterisk maintainers made it more difficult to scan for valid SIP usernames by implementing an option called "alwaysauthreject", which should return a 401 error on all replies which are generated for users which do not exist. While this was sufficient at the time, due to ever increasing compliance with RFC 3261, the SIP specification, that is no longer sufficient as a means towards preventing attackers from checking responses to verify whether a SIP account exists on a machine.    What we have done is to carefully emulate exactly the same responses throughout possible dialogs, which should prevent attackers from gleaning this information. All invalid users, if this option is turned on, will receive the same response throughout the dialog, as if a username was valid, but the password was incorrect.    It is important to note several things. First, this vulnerability is derived directly from the SIP specification, and it is a technical violation of RFC 3261 (and subsequent RFCs, as of this date), for us to return these responses. Second, this attack is made much more difficult if administrators avoided creating all-numeric usernames and especially all-numeric passwords. This combination is extremely vulnerable for servers connected to the public Internet, even with this patch in place. While it may make configuring SIP telephones easier in the short term, it has the potential to cause grief over the long term. |

# Asterisk: Multiple vulnerabilities â€” GLSA **200905-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Asterisk allowing for Denial of
Service and username disclosure.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/asterisk** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.32** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.32** |

### Background

Asterisk is an open source telephony engine and toolkit.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the IAX2 channel
driver when performing the 3-way handshake (CVE-2008-1897), when
handling a large number of POKE requests (CVE-2008-3263), when handling
authentication attempts (CVE-2008-5558) and when handling firmware
download (FWDOWNL) requests (CVE-2008-3264). Asterisk does also not
correctly handle SIP INVITE messages that lack a "From" header
(CVE-2008-2119), and responds differently to a failed login attempt
depending on whether the user account exists (CVE-2008-3903,
CVE-2009-0041).

### Impact

Remote unauthenticated attackers could send specially crafted data to
Asterisk, possibly resulting in a Denial of Service via a daemon crash,
call-number exhaustion, CPU or traffic consumption. Remote
unauthenticated attackers could furthermore enumerate valid usernames
to facilitate brute force login attempts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Asterisk users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/asterisk-1.2.32"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
