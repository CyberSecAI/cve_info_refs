{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A General Protection Fault (GPF) occurring during the return from an interrupt, trap, or system call on FreeBSD/amd64 systems can cause the 'swapgs' CPU instruction to be executed an extra time, leading to a mix of userland and kernel state.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of the 'swapgs' instruction during specific error conditions (GPF while returning from an interrupt, trap or system call).",
       "Improper privilege level switching due to the extra execution of the swapgs instruction"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges, potentially gaining root privileges, breaking out of jails, or bypassing Mandatory Access Control (MAC) restrictions.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is triggered by causing a General Protection Fault (GPF) while the kernel is returning from an interrupt, trap, or system call while manipulating stack frames.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be local and capable of manipulating stack frames in a way that triggers a General Protection Fault (GPF) during a specific kernel return sequence."
