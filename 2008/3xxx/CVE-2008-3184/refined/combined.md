  ## vBulletin 3.7.2 PL1 and 3.6.10 PL3 Released

  Mon 7 Jul '08, 8:34am

  **vBulletin 3.7.2 PL1 / vBulletin 3.6.10 PL3**

  An XSS flaw affecting the vBulletin control panel logging system has been identified, another was found affecting boards running in debug mode. It could allow an attacker to trick an admin into unwittingly performing an action within the control panel that they had not intended. To resolve this issue, it is necessary to release patch level versions of vBulletin 3.7.2 and 3.6.10.

  One of the XSS flaws was discovered by Jessica Hope and the other by ourselves.

  The upgrade process is the same as previous patch level releases - simply download the patch from the [Members Area](http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php), extract the files and upload to your webserver, overwriting the existing files. There is no upgrade script required.

  As with all security-based releases, we recommend that all customers upgrade as soon as possible in order to prevent any potential damage resulting from the flaw being exploited.

  **Upgrading from 3.7.2, 3.6.10 or their patch level versions**

  If you are already running 3.7.2, 3.6.10 or their patch level versions, the process you will be required to follow to make your board immune to the XSS problem is very simple.

  There is no need to run an upgrade script if you are already running 3.7.2, 3.6.10 or their patch level versions.

  Visit the [Patches section of the vBulletin Members' Area](http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php) and download either the patch for 3.7.2, or the patch for 3.6.10, according to the version you are currently running, then extract the files from the archive you downloaded, then upload the files to your board via FTP etc., overwriting the existing files. This will update your version to the PL1 or PL3 release respectively.

  The 3.6.10 PL3 patch file also includes the PL1 and PL2 fixes.

  **Upgrading from Versions Earlier than 3.7.2 or 3.6.10**

  If you are **not** already running 3.7.2 or 3.6.10, you should download the most latest version from the [Members' Area](http://members.vbulletin.com) and perform an upgrade as normal.

  [Full instructions for upgrading vBulletin are available here.](http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/upgrade)

  **Download vBulletin 3.7.2 PL1 or 3.6.10 PL3**

  As usual, both versions released today are available for all customers with valid, active licenses to download from the vBulletin Members' Area.

  There was vB Connect 5.1.1 Alpha 9 that we downloaded and installed. But now, we see 5.1.0 Patch Level 1 only in the download area. Why is the version going backwards? Did they remove alpha/beta versions...

  How do I install these patches? Right...

  I applied the patch level 3 to my vb 3.8.7.

  Nowhere did the patch say during download that only three files were to be updated.

  So I applied all changes. The patch download contains more files...

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
