    "description": "Several integer overflows were discovered in the PyOS_vsnprintf() function.",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The PyOS_vsnprintf() function in Python did not properly handle a zero size parameter. Although the code included an assertion (which is disabled in non-debug builds), it allowed `str[size-1] = '\\0';` to execute when `size` was zero, leading to a write to invalid memory.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Integer underflow.",
          "Out-of-bounds write."
        ],
        "impact": "Memory corruption.",
        "attack_vectors": "By calling the PyOS_vsnprintf function with a size parameter equal to zero, an attacker could trigger an out-of-bounds write to an arbitrary memory address.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to influence the size parameter passed to the vulnerable `PyOS_vsnprintf()` function. This could involve exploiting other vulnerabilities to control this parameter.",

      },
      {
        "root_cause": "In addition to the zero-size parameter, the emulated `vsnprintf()` implementation in `PyOS_vsnprintf` also allocated memory without verifying the summed value, leading to a potential integer overflow and subsequent memory misallocation.",
         "weaknesses": [
            "Integer overflow.",
            "Memory corruption."
          ],
          "impact": "Memory corruption and potential for arbitrary code execution on esoteric platforms.",
           "attack_vectors": "An attacker could trigger this vulnerability by passing large size values to the `PyOS_vsnprintf` function which would lead to an integer overflow when calculating the memory allocation size.",
            "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to influence the size parameter passed to the vulnerable `PyOS_vsnprintf()` function.",
