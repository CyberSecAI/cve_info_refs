How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- powerdns spoofing problems
The PowerDNS packages were updated to offer better spoofing
resistance by not ignoring invalid queries. (CVE-2008-3337)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- dnsmasq spoofing problems
The DNS server dnsmasq was changed to use random UDP source ports
and a random TRXID now. (CVE-2008-1447)
This problem only affected openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.

The helper library neon was updated to fix a NULL pointer dereference
in the digest authentication code. (CVE-2008-3746)
neon was updated on all affected distributions.
- rxvt-unicode session hijacking
Using rxvt-unicode it was possible to open a terminal on :0 when
the environment variable was not set.
This could be exploited by local users to hijack X11 connections (CVE-2008-1142).
rxvt-unicode was updated on openSUSE 10.2-11.0.
- perl multiple problems
Several problems were fixed in the scripting language perl.
Specially crafted regular expressions could crash perl
(CVE-2008-1927).
Insufficient symlink checks in the File::Path could result in wrong
file permissions (CVE-2008-2827).
Additionally problem in the CGI module was fixed that could result
in an endless loop if uploads were canceled.
- Wireshark / ethereal multiple security problems
Various vulnerabilities have been fixed in ethereal and wireshark:
CVE-2008-3137, CVE-2008-3138, CVE-2008-3139,
CVE-2008-3140, CVE-2008-3141, CVE-2008-3145
and CVE-2008-3146. Those could be potentially used to crash
wireshark or potentially execute code.
Updates have been released for all SUSE Linux distributions.
- namazu cross site scripting
The indexing engine namazu was upgraded to fix a UTF-7
cross-site-scripting vulnerability. (CVE-2008-1468)
namazu was updated on all products containing it.
- gnome-screensaver clipboard disclosure
gnome-screensaver was updated to disallows local users to
read the contents of the clipboard for a locked screen using
ctrl-v. (CVE-2007-6389)
Updates have been released for openSUSE 10.3, other distributions
were not affected.
- MySQL security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix a security problem:
CVE-2008-2079: MySQL allowed local users to bypass certain privilege
checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1)
DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within
the MySQL home data directory, which can point to tables that are
created in the future.
CVE-2006-7232: sql\_select.cc in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.32 and 5.1.x
before 5.1.14 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA
table, as originally demonstrated using ORDER BY.
MySQL was updated on all SUSE Linux distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:

| ``` The PyOS_vsnprintf() contains the caveat that the length parameter cannot be zero, however this is only enforced via assert() which is compiled out. As a result if the length parameter is zero then the function will underflow and write a null byte to invalid memory.   53 int  54 PyOS_vsnprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char  *format, va_list va)  55 {  56         int len;  /* # bytes written, excluding \0 */  57 #ifndef HAVE_SNPRINTF  58         char *buffer;  59 #endif  60         assert(str != NULL);  61         assert(size > 0);  62         assert(format != NULL);  [...]  65         len = vsnprintf(str, size, format, va);  [...]  91         str[size-1] = '\0';  92         return len;  93 } ``` | | | |

| ``` I can generally agree with that, and I admit I haven't verified all of the code paths here- theres several hundred of them leading into this function, are you positive all of them are safe? (seems like it would be easier to just move the check into an if than sitting down and verifying that all XXX hundred code paths are safe).  In the other bug, I have verified code paths into it, for instance test the misallocation poc in 2586 as an example ``` | | | |

| ``` As long as snprintf is used with a fixed size buffer using an idiom   snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), ..)  there is no issue because sizeof(buffer) cannot be zero.  AFAICT, this  is how python uses PyOS_vsnprintf wrapper.  On the other hand, may this is a good opportunity to revisit the  decision to make  PyOS_vsnprintf semantics different from C99 vsnprintf.  C99 defines snprintf semantics as follows:  int snprintf(char *restrict s, size_t n,        const char *restrict format, ...);  The snprintf() function shall be equivalent to sprintf(), with the  addition of the n argument which states the size of the buffer referred  to by s. If n is zero, nothing shall be written and s may be a null  pointer. Otherwise, output bytes beyond the n-1st shall be discarded  instead of being written to the array, and a null byte is written at the  end of the bytes actually written into the array.  <<http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/printf.html>> ``` | | | |

| ``` I do agree with your point about snprintf(..., sizeof(x), ...)-- my single biggest point (and maybe i'm just not seeing it), is that there appears to be no good reason for having this caveat and in turn its essentially just code waiting to break; with as commonly used of a function as it is, it's really a matter of when and not so much if.  While no one seems to ever use it this way, don't forget that a good alternative to asprintf() is calling sprintf() with a length of zero to get the length (in compliant implementations), allocating the memory and then calling it again. ``` | | | |

Remember that PyOS_vsnprintf was introduced back in 2001 when (according to the comments in the file) not all platforms provided c99 compliant implementations.  If you can verify that the situation has changes for the supported platforms, I think you will have a good case for making the wrapper c99 compliant. ``` | | | |

| ``` Actually, I'm not sure things are any better today- even the same operating system but different versions have inconsistencies, for instance on some versions of RHEL the vsnprintf() can fail during unicode conversion. MSVCRT still returns -1 on truncation, et cetera.  That said, theres plenty of other implementations that manage this without the potential of underflowing a buffer ``` | | | |

| [Description](#c0)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-18 01:46:19 UTC  ``` Three issues in Python have been reported:  ============================================================= CVE-2008-3142 Justin Ferguson: Multiple buffer overflows in unicode processing  The unicode_resize() function acts essentially as a wrapper to realloc(), it accomplishes this via the PyMem_RESIZE() macro which factors the size with the size of the type, in this case it multiplies by two as Py_UNICODE is typedef'd to a wchar_t. When resizing large strings, this results in an incorrect allocation that in turn leads to buffer overflow.  Bug: <http://bugs.python.org/issue2620> Proposed patch: <http://bugs.python.org/file10825/issue2620-gps02-patch.txt>  Only affects 32 bit systems.  ============================================================= CVE-2008-3143 "Google integer overflows"  Added checks for integer overflows, contributed by Google. Some are only available if asserts are left in the code, in cases where they can't be triggered from Python code.  <http://svn.python.org/view?rev=60793&view=rev>  Fixes are in 2.5.2.  ============================================================= CVE-2008-3144 Justin Ferguson PyOS integer underflow/overflow  Fix potential integer underflow and overflow conditions in the PyOS_vsnprintf C API function.  This is a backport of r63728 and r63734 from trunk. <http://svn.python.org/view?rev=63883&view=rev>  Fix issue2589: there was a potential integer overflow leading to memory corruption on esoteric platforms and incorrect behavior on normal platforms. <http://bugs.python.org/issue2589> <http://svn.python.org/view?rev=63728&view=rev>  Fix issue2588: Do not execute str[size-1] = '\0' when a 0 size is passed in.  (The assert won't prevent this in non-debug builds). <http://svn.python.org/view?rev=63734&view=rev> <http://bugs.python.org/issue2588> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-18 02:26:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 160679](attachment.cgi?id=160679 "python-2.4.4-CVE-2008-3144.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=160679&action=edit "python-2.4.4-CVE-2008-3144.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=160679&action=diff "python-2.4.4-CVE-2008-3144.patch")] python-2.4.4-CVE-2008-3144.patch ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-28 20:22:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 161577](attachment.cgi?id=161577 "python-2.4.4-CVE-2008-3142.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=161577&action=edit "python-2.4.4-CVE-2008-3142.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=161577&action=diff "python-2.4.4-CVE-2008-3142.patch")] python-2.4.4-CVE-2008-3142.patch ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-28 20:22:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 161579](attachment.cgi?id=161579 "python-2.4.4-CVE-2008-3143.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=161579&action=edit "python-2.4.4-CVE-2008-3143.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=161579&action=diff "python-2.4.4-CVE-2008-3143.patch")] python-2.4.4-CVE-2008-3143.patch ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tiziano Müller (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-31 13:56:46 UTC  ``` Fixed together with the patches from [bug #230640](show_bug.cgi?id=230640 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-lang/python <2.4.4-r14 integer overflows (CVE-2008-2315, CVE-2008-2316)") ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-31 23:34:27 UTC  ``` GLSA 200807-16 ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-632-1: Python vulnerabilities

1 August 2008

Python vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [python2.4](/security/cves?package=python2.4) -
* [python2.5](/security/cves?package=python2.5) -

## Details

It was discovered that there were new integer overflows in the imageop

module. If an attacker were able to trick a Python application into

processing a specially crafted image, they could execute arbitrary code

with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1679](/security/CVE-2008-1679))

Justin Ferguson discovered that the zlib module did not correctly

handle certain archives. If an attacker were able to trick a Python

application into processing a specially crafted archive file, they could

execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1721](/security/CVE-2008-1721))

Justin Ferguson discovered that certain string manipulations in Python

could be made to overflow. If an attacker were able to pass a specially

crafted string through the PyString\_FromStringAndSize function, they

could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1887](/security/CVE-2008-1887))

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Python's core and modules

including hashlib, binascii, pickle, md5, stringobject, unicodeobject,

bufferobject, longobject, tupleobject, stropmodule, gcmodule, and

mmapmodule. If an attacker were able to exploit these flaws they could

execute arbitrary code with user privileges or cause Python applications

to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-2315](/security/CVE-2008-2315), [CVE-2008-2316](/security/CVE-2008-2316),

[CVE-2008-3142](/security/CVE-2008-3142), [CVE-2008-3143](/security/CVE-2008-3143), [CVE-2008-3144](/security/CVE-2008-3144)).

# Python: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200807-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Python may allow for the execution of arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/python** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.2-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.4.4-r14**>= **2.5.2-r6**revision >= **2.4.6** |

### Background

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Python:

* David Remahl of Apple Product Security reported several integer
  overflows in core modules such as stringobject, unicodeobject,
  bufferobject, longobject, tupleobject, stropmodule, gcmodule,
  mmapmodule (CVE-2008-2315).
* David Remahl of Apple Product Security also reported an integer
  overflow in the hashlib module, leading to unreliable cryptographic
  digest results (CVE-2008-2316).
* Justin Ferguson reported multiple buffer overflows in unicode string
  processing that only affect 32bit systems (CVE-2008-3142).
* The Google Security Team reported multiple integer overflows
  (CVE-2008-3143).
* Justin Ferguson reported multiple integer underflows and overflows in
  the PyOS\_vsnprintf() function, and an off-by-one error when passing
  zero-length strings, leading to memory corruption (CVE-2008-3144).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities in Python
applications or daemons that pass user-controlled input to vulnerable
functions. Exploitation might lead to the execution of arbitrary code
or a Denial of Service. Vulnerabilities within the hashlib might lead
to weakened cryptographic protection of data integrity or authenticity.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Python 2.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.4.4-r14"
```

All Python 2.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.5.2-r6"
```

Please note that Python 2.3 is masked since June 24, and we will not be
releasing updates to it. It will be removed from the tree in the near
future.

| ``` On architectures that do not have a vsnprintf() in their standard library Python attempts to emulate it. When doing so, the implementation ambitiously allocates more memory than requested without verifying the sanity of the summed value. As a result it becomes possible (although unlikely) for an integer overflow to occur misallocating memory and causing a buffer overflow.   53 int  54 PyOS_vsnprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char  *format, va_list va)  55 {  56         int len;  /* # bytes written, excluding \0 */ [...]  60         assert(str != NULL);  61         assert(size > 0);  62         assert(format != NULL);  63  [...]  67         /* Emulate it. */  68         buffer = PyMem_MALLOC(size + 512);  69         if (buffer == NULL) {  70                 len = -666;  71                 goto Done;  72         }  73   74         len = vsprintf(buffer, format, va);  75         if (len < 0)  76                 /* ignore the error */;  77   78         else if ((size_t)len >= size + 512)  79                 Py_FatalError("Buffer overflow in PyOS_snprintf/PyOS_vsnprintf");  80   81         else {  82                 const size_t to_copy = (size_t)len < size ?  83                                         (size_t)len : size - 1;  84                 assert(to_copy < size);  85                 memcpy(str, buffer, to_copy);  86                 str[to_copy] = '\0';  87         }  88         PyMem_FREE(buffer);  89 Done: [...]  91         str[size-1] = '\0';  92         return len;  93 } ``` | | | |

| ``` Fixed in trunk [r63728](https://hg.python.org/lookup/r63728).   There was a problem with the code on normal architectures as well.  The input was a size_t while the output was an int.  So an integer overflow could have happened going from the vsnprintf return value to the integer since size_t is unsigned and int isn't (also when size_t is a larger type than an int).  I don't think that would lead to memory corruption when using the system's vsnprintf but it could have bad results if the caller expected str to be null terminated properly.   I will backport this to release25-maint. ``` | | | |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Notes: These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely only if the
attacker has access to the Service Console network.

Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the
Service Console be isolated from the VM network. Please see
[http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](/resources/techresources/726) for more
information on VMware security best practices.

The currently installed version of JRE depends on your patch
deployment history.

c. Third party library update for ntp.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0 have a ntp client that is affected by the
following security issue. Note that the same security issue is
present in the ESX Service Console as described in section d. of
this advisory.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
The NTP security issue identified by CVE-2009-0159 is not relevant

f. Updated Service Console package python

Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.
When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service.
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service.
An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721
CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143

Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
is operating correctly.
A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)

h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
files.

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)

i. Updated Service Console package curl

Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5\_3.5
A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.

A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Florian L. Klein    2002-05-01 07:41:22 UTC  ``` /usr/bin/ant is a shell script to start the Java build tool ANT. It retrieves some environment settings from /etc/env.d/20java. My active Java kit is blackdown-jdk-1.3.1.  Unfortunately the file 20java has several lines containing the string JAVA_HOME, with the shell script getting all of them instead of only the line setting the variable. As a result, JAVA_HOME will contain a multiline string which ANT doesn't like.  Fix: /usr/bin/ant, line 11:  - JAVA_HOME=`grep JAVA_HOME $envfile | sed "s/JAVA_HOME=//" + JAVA_HOME=`grep "^JAVA_HOME" $envfile | sed "s/JAVA_HOME=//"` ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Karl Trygve Kalleberg (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-05-03 14:50:54 UTC  ``` Fixed in dev-java/ant-1.4.1-r3 ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
