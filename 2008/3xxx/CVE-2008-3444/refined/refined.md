{
  "CVE-2008-3444": {
    "Description": "The content layout component in Mozilla Firefox 3.0 and 3.0.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted but well-formed web page that contains \"a simple set of legitimate HTML tags.\"",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by incorrect handling of content insertion notifications within the content sink, leading to double notifications for the same DOM node. Specifically, a DOM mutation via `InsertChildAt` was not properly followed by a notification, causing issues with `mInsertionPoint` and subsequent calls to `FlushTags`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of content insertion notifications",
      "Inconsistent state of `mInsertionPoint` across different contexts"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the browser via a crafted HTML page.",
    "Attack vectors": "A user visiting a malicious web page.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a specially crafted HTML page. No special privileges or positions are required."
