```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in BoonEx Dolphin 6.1.2 when register_globals is enabled. This allows an attacker to inject a URL into the 'dir[plugins]' parameter of HTMLSax3.php and safehtml.php, and 'sIncPath' parameter of content.inc.php.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to include malicious files from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Code Injection: By including a malicious file, the attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code that will be executed by the web server.

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the application and possibly the server itself.
- Full Control: An attacker could gain full control over the application and its data, potentially leading to data theft, defacement, or further malicious activities.
- Compromised System: The attacker can gain access to the server, potentially compromising other services on the same server and network.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP GET requests: The attacker sends a malicious HTTP GET request with specific parameters to vulnerable PHP files.
- Vulnerable parameters: The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the following GET parameters:
  - 'dir[plugins]' parameter to HTMLSax3.php and safehtml.php (in plugins/safehtml/)
  - 'sIncPath' parameter to content.inc.php (in ray/modules/global/inc/)

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Remote attacker: The attacker does not need any access to the server. They can exploit it through web requests.
- No authentication required: The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication.
- Web server access: The attacker requires the web server to be running and reachable through the internet or local network.
- The vulnerable application: BoonEx Dolphin 6.1.2 with `register_globals` enabled.
