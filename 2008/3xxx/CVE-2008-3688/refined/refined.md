Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2008-3688:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An infinite loop exists in `sockethandler.cpp` when HAVP attempts to connect to a non-responsive HTTP server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) issue.
- The code does not handle non-responsive HTTP servers properly, resulting in an infinite loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by sending requests to unavailable servers.
- The infinite loop consumes resources, potentially making the HAVP service unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit this by sending requests to non-responsive HTTP servers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the HAVP service.
- No special privileges or authentication is required

**Affected software:**
- `net-proxy/havp` versions prior to 0.89
