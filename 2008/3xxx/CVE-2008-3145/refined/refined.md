```
Root cause of vulnerability:
A flaw exists in the packet reassembling module of Wireshark.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Denial of service vulnerability due to a flaw in packet reassembly.

Impact of exploitation:
A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending specially crafted packets, leading to a crash of the Wireshark application.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting malformed packets onto the network being monitored by Wireshark, or by opening a malformed packet trace file.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running Wireshark, or to provide a malformed trace file to the user.
