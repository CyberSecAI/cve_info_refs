Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3266:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection in the `picture_pic_bv.asp` page, specifically via the `key` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user input provided to the `key` parameter in `picture_pic_bv.asp`. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code into the query. The "blind" aspect implies the attacker might not directly see the results of the query, but can infer information based on the server's response (e.g., time taken to respond, presence/absence of specific text).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database. The exploit provided targets the extraction of the `password` from the `login` table.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** With access to user credentials or other sensitive information, an attacker can potentially escalate their access, potentially leading to data breaches, account compromise, and further attacks on the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `picture_pic_bv.asp` page with a malicious SQL payload in the `key` parameter.
*   The attacker injects SQL queries into the `key` parameter. A Perl script is provided to automate the process of extracting data via the blind SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL injection techniques, especially blind SQL injection.
*   **Ability to make HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests and analyze the responses.
*   The attacker does not require any credentials or specific user-level access; the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
