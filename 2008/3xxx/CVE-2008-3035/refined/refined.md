Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3035

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw present in the `boardID` parameter of the `newThread.php` script in XchangeBoard version 1.70 and lower. This occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly uses the `boardID` parameter in an SQL query without adequate sanitization or parameterization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database. This can result in:
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Retrieval of sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, email addresses, and other user information. In the provided exploit example, the attacker retrieves the email and password information.
    *   **Data Modification:** Modification of existing data in the database, potentially leading to data corruption or defacement.
    *   **Data Deletion:** Deletion of data from the database.
    *   **Potential Complete System Compromise:** If the database user has sufficient permissions, a successful injection can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the `newThread.php` script, manipulating the `boardID` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be a registered user of the application, as noted in the exploit details.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
    *   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the applicationâ€™s structure and how to craft malicious SQL queries.

**Exploit Details (from exploit-db.com):**

*   **Vulnerable Application:** XchangeBoard 1.70 final and lower.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):**
    ```
    http://site.com/path/newThread.php?boardID=+999999%20union%20select%20email,concat_ws(0x3a,nick,substring(password,1,100)),email,email,email%20from%20user/*
    ```
    This PoC demonstrates how an attacker can use the `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the user table.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit mentions that credentials (passwords) are saved as cookies. While not directly part of the SQL injection vulnerability, this reveals additional security weaknesses in the application.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a classic SQL injection, where a lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to execute malicious SQL queries, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.
