Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3550 (Although this ID is not explicitly mentioned in the content, the provided information is about a cross-site scripting vulnerability in IBM ClearQuest, which is likely the vulnerability assigned this CVE number).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the login page of IBM ClearQuest.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary script code into the login page by inserting a specific input (`?script? any characters ?/script?`) into the `id` field. This input is not properly sanitized or handled by the application which causes the source code of the page to be revealed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session, which can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Data theft:** Extracting sensitive information displayed on the page.
    *   **Phishing:** Displaying a fake login form to steal user credentials.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or injecting malware into the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the login page of IBM ClearQuest. The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting a specially crafted string (`?script? any characters ?/script?`) into the `id` field during login.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the login page of IBM ClearQuest. This can be achieved either by direct access or by tricking a user into accessing a malicious link containing the exploit.
*   The attacker does not need any specific privileges or access.

**Additional Details:**
* The issue was reported as APAR PK68332.
* The vulnerability is described as an XSS issue in the login page.
* The vulnerability was closed as unreproducible in a future release, suggesting that the issue was addressed and resolved in later versions of IBM ClearQuest.
* The fix is applicable to multiple releases of IBM ClearQuest, from R603 to R701.

In summary, this document describes a classic XSS vulnerability in IBM ClearQuest login page, triggered by specific input. This vulnerability could be exploited by attackers to perform malicious actions through user's web browser.
