    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities with unsigned applets were reported. A remote attacker could misuse an unsigned applet to connect to localhost services running on the host running the applet.",
    "root_cause": "The Java plug-in does not block applets from launching file:// URLs, and there are multiple vulnerabilities related to handling unsigned applets that allow them to bypass network access restrictions and establish socket connections to local services.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of URLs in Java plug-in",
      "Bypassing of network access restrictions by untrusted applets",
        "Ability of untrusted applets to establish socket connections to services on localhost"
    ],
    "impact": "Visiting a website containing a maliciously crafted Java applet may allow a remote attacker to launch local files or connect to local services, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "Visiting a website hosting a malicious Java applet.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker needs to entice a user to visit a malicious website hosting a crafted Java applet or manipulate an application to process malicious XML.",
       "additional_info": "This is an Apple-specific issue. IBM Java 1.4.2 SR12, 1.5.0, and 1.6.0 as well as Sun Java 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 are affected. Some vulnerabilities require a trusted environment, user interaction, a DNS Man-in-the-Middle or Cross-Site-Scripting attack to be exploited."
