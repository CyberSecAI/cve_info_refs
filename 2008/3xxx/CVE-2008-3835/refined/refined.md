Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-3835:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `nsXMLDocument::OnChannelRedirect()` function. This function is responsible for handling redirects when loading XML documents.
*   The same-origin check implemented in `nsXMLDocument::OnChannelRedirect()` could be bypassed. This means that a malicious website could trick the browser into thinking it had the same origin as a different website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypassed Same-Origin Check:** The core weakness is the failure of the same-origin check in the described function.
*   **Incorrect Principal Association:** The check relies on the principal of an associated JavaScript context. This principal could be manipulated by loading a cross-origin page within that context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute JavaScript code within the security context of a different website. This would enable them to potentially steal cookies, manipulate the content of the target site, or perform actions as if they were the victim user on the target site.
*   **Chrome Privilege Escalation:** If JavaScript was enabled in email (in the case of Thunderbird), this same vulnerability could be exploited for chrome privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to execute code with the privileges of the email client.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** The attack would involve tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted malicious website.
*   **Cross-Origin Page Load:** The attacker would need to load a cross-origin page in the same JavaScript context before `nsXMLDocument::OnChannelRedirect()` is called.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Web Content:** The attacker needs the capability to serve web pages to a victim user, typically through a web server.
*   **Trick User Interaction:** The attacker needs the victim user to interact with malicious web content or load a malicious XML document.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is described as "fx2-only", meaning it was present in Firefox 2.x versions but not in trunk builds of Firefox where the same-origin check compares an old URI to a new URI.
*   Firefox 3 was not affected by this vulnerability, indicating that the fix involved a significant change in how the same-origin check was implemented.
*   Thunderbird could be vulnerable if JavaScript is enabled in email, which is not a default setting but is a possible attack vector if enabled.
*   The issue was resolved in Firefox 2.0.0.17, SeaMonkey 1.1.12, and Thunderbird 2.0.0.17
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4.
*   The fix involved removing the ability to do cross-site loads with `document.load()` if the caller had elevated privileges.
