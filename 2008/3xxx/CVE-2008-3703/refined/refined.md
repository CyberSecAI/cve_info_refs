The management console allows NULL NTLMSSP authentication thereby enabling a remote attacker to add, modify, or delete snapshots schedules and consequently run arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.",

An attacker with network access who could connect directly to the Scheduler Service socket could bypass the security update to the previously reported issue. By properly manipulating this vector, the attacker has the potential to add arbitrary commands to the registry that, if properly constructed, would be executed on the targeted system during normal scheduled runs.",
