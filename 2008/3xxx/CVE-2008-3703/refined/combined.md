# Advisory Details

August 14th, 2008
## Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation Scheduler Service NULL Session Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

### ZDI-08-053ZDI-CAN-359

| CVE ID | [CVE-2008-3703](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3703) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Symantec](http://www.symantec.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Veritas Storage Foundation](http://www.symantec.com/enterprise/products/overview.jsp?pcid=1020&pvid=203_1) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists in the functionality exposed by the Storage Foundation for Windows Scheduler Service, VxSchedService.exe, which listens by default on TCP port 4888. The management console allows NULL NTLMSSP authentication thereby enabling a remote attacker to add, modify, or delete snapshots schedules and consequently run arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Symantec has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/2008.08.14a.html> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2008-06-26 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2008-08-14 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

Symantec Security Advisory
SYM08-015
14 Aug, 2008
Veritas Storage Foundation for Windows Volume Manager Scheduler Service for
Windows Security Update Circumvention
Revision History
None
Severity
Medium
Remote Access Yes, network access required
Local Access No
Authentication Required No
Exploit publicly available No
Overview
It is possible to circumvent the security patch that resolved a previously
identified authentication bypass, remote code execution
vulnerability in the Veritas Storage Foundation for Windows v5.0 Volume
Manager Scheduler Service. Successful exploitation
could result in potential compromise of the targeted system.
Product(s) Affected
Product Version Solution(s)
Veritas Storage Foundation for Windows 5.0, 5.0 RP1a, 5.1
http://entsupport.symantec.com/docs/306386
Note: Only those versions identified above are affected by this issue.
Details
3Com Zero Day Initiative, notified Symantec of a vector that can allow a
malicious user to circumvent the security update for an
authentication bypass vulnerability previously reported in the Veritas
Storage Foundation for Windows Scheduler Service,
http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/2007.06.01.html.
The Scheduler Service server, introduced in Veritas Storage Foundation for
Windows v5.0, listens for incoming scheduling messages
from client systems. An attacker with network access who could connect
directly to the Scheduler Service socket could bypass the
security update to the previously reported issue. By properly manipulating
this vector, the attacker has the potential to add
arbitrary commands to the registry that, if properly constructed, would be
executed on the targeted system during normal scheduled runs.
Symantec Response
Symantec engineers have verified and resolved this issue in the Veritas
Storage Foundation for Windows versions and builds identified above.
Symantec recommends customers apply the latest product update available for
their supported product versions to enhance their security
posture and protect against potential security threats of this nature.
Symantec knows of no exploitation of or adverse customer impact from this
issue.
The patches listed above for affected product/version are available from
the following location:
http://entsupport.symantec.com/docs/306386
Best Practices
As part of normal best practices, Symantec strongly recommends:
\* Restrict access to administration or management systems to privileged
users.
\* Restrict remote access, if required, to trusted/authorized systems only.
\* Run under the principle of least privilege where possible to limit the
impact of exploit by threats.
\* Keep all operating systems and applications updated with the latest
vendor patches.
\* Follow a multi-layered approach to security. Run both firewall and
anti-malware applications, at a minimum, to provide multiple points
of detection and protection to both inbound and outbound threats.
\* Deploy network and host-based intrusion detection systems to monitor
network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity.
This may aid in detection of attacks or malicious activity related to
exploitation of latent vulnerabilities

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
