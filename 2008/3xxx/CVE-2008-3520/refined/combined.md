## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# JasPer: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200812-18**

Multiple memory management errors in JasPer might lead to execution of
arbitrary code via jpeg2k files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/jasper** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.900.1-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.900.1-r3** |

### Background

The JasPer Project is an open-source initiative to provide a free
software-based reference implementation of the codec specified in the
JPEG-2000 Part-1 (jpeg2k) standard.

### Description

Marc Espie and Christian Weisgerber have discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in JasPer:

* Multiple integer overflows might allow for insufficient memory
  allocation, leading to heap-based buffer overflows (CVE-2008-3520).
* The jas\_stream\_printf() function in libjasper/base/jas\_stream.c uses
  vsprintf() to write user-provided data to a static to a buffer, leading
  to an overflow (CVE-2008-3522).

### Impact

Remote attackers could entice a user or automated system to process
specially crafted jpeg2k files with an application using JasPer,
possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All JasPer users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/jasper-1.900.1-r3"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-05-19 14:46:36 UTC  ``` Marc Espie and Christian Weisgerber have discoverd several integer overflows in libjasper  ** Please note that this issue is confidential at the moment and no information should be disclosed until it is made public ** ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Patrick Kursawe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-05-20 07:15:03 UTC  ``` What exactly am I supposed to do about this without any further information/patches/updated versions available? I am a bit irritated. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-05-20 21:35:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=222819#c1)) > What exactly am I supposed to do about this without any further > information/patches/updated versions available? I am a bit irritated. >   sorry, the CC was just to inform you. For the moment, patches have been provided on vendor-sec, but some of them are *BSD specific (e.g they use strlcat()), so they'll need some additional work to make them apply on Linux. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-19 09:29:19 UTC  ``` The following analysis was provided by Ludwig Nussel of Suse/Novell:  CVE-2008-3520: - patches change all occurrences of malloc(a*b) with   jas_alloc2(a,b). Hard to tell whether any are actually   exploitable. Some seem to multiply a value from the file with the   size of a structure indeed. The ones that multiply two variables   seem to be harmless due to 16 or only 8 bit values. I talked to   Marc Espie but he is not interested in investigating it further.   So unless someone wants to spend a lot of time analyzing the   context of every multiplication patching all such places seems to   be a logical defensive measurement.  CVE-2008-3521: - tmp race in jas_stream_tmpfile(), jas_stream.c  CVE-2008-3522: - vsprintf buffer overflow in jas_stream_printf(), jas_stream.c. Potentially   dangerous. Called from mif_hdr_put() where it's not obvious to me   whether there is a limit on the passed string.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-19 09:30:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 163282](attachment.cgi?id=163282 "jasper-1.900.1-CVE-2008-3520+1+2.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=163282&action=edit "jasper-1.900.1-CVE-2008-3520+1+2.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=163282&action=diff "jasper-1.900.1-CVE-2008-3520+1+2.patch")] jasper-1.900.1-CVE-2008-3520+1+2.patch  Relevant portions of the patches shipped by OpenBSD ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-19 09:31:57 UTC  ``` Patrick, we are currently discussing whether the patch and information about the vulnerabilities should be embargoed and until when.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0698)

## Topic

Updated rhevm-spice-client packages that fix multiple security issues,
several bugs, and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager provides access to virtual
machines using SPICE. These SPICE client packages provide the SPICE client
and usbclerk service for both Windows 32-bit operating systems and Windows
64-bit operating systems.

This update adds support for the TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value
(TLS\_FALLBACK\_SCSV), which can be used to prevent protocol downgrade
attacks against applications which re-connect using a lower SSL/TLS
protocol version when the initial connection indicating the highest
supported protocol version fails.

This can prevent a forceful downgrade of the communication to SSL 3.0.
The SSL 3.0 protocol was found to be vulnerable to the padding oracle
attack when using block cipher suites in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
This issue is identified as CVE-2014-3566, and also known under the alias
POODLE. This SSL 3.0 protocol flaw will not be addressed in a future
update; it is recommended that users configure their applications to
require at least TLS protocol version 1.0 for secure communication.

For additional information about this flaw, see the Knowledgebase article
at <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123>

Multiple flaws were found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 image files.
A specially crafted file could cause an application using JasPer to crash
or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8138, CVE-2014-8157,
CVE-2014-8158, CVE-2014-9029, CVE-2014-8137, CVE-2011-4516, CVE-2011-4517,
CVE-2008-3520, CVE-2008-3522)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2014-8137,
CVE-2014-8138, CVE-2014-8157, CVE-2014-8158, CVE-2014-9029, CVE-2011-4516,
and CVE-2011-4517. oCERT acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security
Team as the original reporter of CVE-2014-8137 and CVE-2014-8138; and
pyddeh as the original reporter of CVE-2014-8157 and CVE-2014-8158.

The mingw-openssl and mingw-jasper packages have been upgraded to the
latest upstream version, which provides a number of bug fixes and
enhancements over the previous version. (BZ#1187585)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, a guest system installed with tools incorrectly always

started in full screen mode, even when the "Open in Full Screen" option was
unchecked in console options. Now, when connecting in window mode with the
option unchecked, the guest system starts in a window as expected.
(BZ#1172126)

* Prior to this update, copying and pasting of images from the client to

the guest did not work when spice-gtk was built from upstream. Now, images
can be copied and pasted without problems. (BZ#1187270)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

* Administrators now have the option of automatic multiuser installation of

virt-viewer onto many client workstations. (BZ#1187272)

All rhevm-spice-client users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancement.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=461477#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-08 13:30:05 UTC  ``` Marc Espie and Christian Weisgerber of the OpenBSD project reported that jas_stream_tmpfile() function used by jasper to create temporary files uses tmpnam C library function to create temporary names.  Usage of tmpnam function may result in races in temporary file creation.  OpenBSD jasper library patches: <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/graphics/jasper/patches/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=461477#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-08 13:35:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 316078](attachment.cgi?id=316078&action=diff "OpenBSD patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=316078&action=edit "OpenBSD patch") OpenBSD patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=461477#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-08 13:44:53 UTC  ``` Even though tmpnam is used in jas_stream_tmpfile, subsequent open is called with O_CREAT | O_EXCL flags.  Therefore, this can not be used to overwrite / create new files via symlink attack.  Attacker may possibly be able to create a file with the name returned by tmpnam before open is called, but open will fail in such case and that failure is handled gracefully by jasper.  At worst, this can result in a DoS attack against an application using jasper.  An attacker needs to win a race (not trivial), and the same result can be achieved via easier ways (fill /tmp partition), which are not prevented by mkstemp usage.  Therefore, this will not be treated as a security issue.  As for netpbm, which contains copy (part of) of the jasper code, it uses mkstemp in the recent versions (such as those shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and current Fedora versions).   ``` |  |

# USN-742-1: JasPer vulnerabilities

19 March 2009

JasPer vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [jasper](/security/cves?package=jasper) -

## Details

It was discovered that JasPer did not correctly handle memory allocation

when parsing certain malformed JPEG2000 images. If a user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted image with an application that uses libjasper,

an attacker could cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary

code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2008-3520](/security/CVE-2008-3520))

It was discovered that JasPer created temporary files in an insecure way.

Local users could exploit a race condition and cause a denial of service in

libjasper applications.

([CVE-2008-3521](/security/CVE-2008-3521))

It was discovered that JasPer did not correctly handle certain formatting

operations. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image

with an application that uses libjasper, an attacker could cause a denial

of service and possibly execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.

([CVE-2008-3522](/security/CVE-2008-3522))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=461476#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-08 13:29:29 UTC  ``` Marc Espie and Christian Weisgerber of the OpenBSD project identified multiple possible integer overflows in jasper.  Problems occur in jas_malloc calls, where integer overflows may result in an insufficient memory allocation, leading to a heap based buffer overflow.  OpenBSD jasper library patches: <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/graphics/jasper/patches/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=461476#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-08 13:35:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 316077](attachment.cgi?id=316077&action=diff "OpenBSD patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=316077&action=edit "OpenBSD patch") OpenBSD patch  This patch introduces jas_alloc[23] and jas_realloc2 functions and replaces all jas_malloc calls with argument containing multiplication of 2 or 3 values.  In multiple cases, such change is not necessary (product is guaranteed not to overflow), and it was not further investigated in which cases overflow is possible and in which it is not possible.  All occurrences were possibly identified with something like:   egrep -r --color 'jas_malloc[[:space:]]*\(.*\*' *   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=461476#c3)  Jindrich Novy    2008-12-05 04:08:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 325790](attachment.cgi?id=325790&action=diff "More complete fix for CVE-2008-3520") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=325790&action=edit "More complete fix for CVE-2008-3520") More complete fix for [CVE-2008-3520](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-3520)  It seems that the OpenBSD patch misses completely the jpc/jpc_cs.c, where jas_malloc() is used frequently with an argument containing multiplication with sizeof(random_type). I converted the jas_malloc(A * sizeof(unsigned char)) to jas_alloc2() as well to be paranoidly sure it won't ever happen to overflow even on weird platforms where sizeof(char) != 1.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=461476#c4)  Jindrich Novy    2008-12-05 11:38:39 UTC  ``` Returning back to NEW state. This is just a tracking bug.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=461476#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2008-12-10 15:16:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=461476#c3)) > It seems that the OpenBSD patch misses completely the jpc/jpc_cs.c, where > jas_malloc() is used frequently with an argument containing multiplication with > sizeof(random_type).  What is the difference between patch [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=461476#c1) and [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=461476#c1) wrt jpc/jpc_cs.c?  The only difference I see is related to this change:  > I converted the jas_malloc(A * sizeof(unsigned char)) to jas_alloc2() as well > to be paranoidly sure it won't ever happen to overflow even on weird > platforms where sizeof(char) != 1.  so   jas_malloc(ppm->len * sizeof(unsigned char))  is changed to:   jas_alloc2(ppm->len, sizeof(unsigned char))  rather than:   jas_malloc(ppm->len)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=461476#c6)  Jindrich Novy    2008-12-11 10:48:09 UTC  ``` Ok, my bad. The jpc/jpc_cs.c hunks were lost in rejected patch application while backporting the OpenBSD patch. In any case, it is now fixed.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=461476#c8)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-26 16:59:51 UTC  ``` jasper-1.900.1-13.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/jasper-1.900.1-13.fc11>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=461476#c9)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-26 17:01:00 UTC  ``` jasper-1.900.1-13.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/jasper-1.900.1-13.fc10>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=461476#c10)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-26 17:01:41 UTC  ``` jasper-1.900.1-13.el5 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 5. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/jasper-1.900.1-13.el5>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=461476#c11)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-26 17:02:22 UTC  ``` jasper-1.900.1-13.el4 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 4. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/jasper-1.900.1-13.el4>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=461476#c12)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-27 06:36:58 UTC  ``` jasper-1.900.1-13.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=461478#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-08 13:30:10 UTC  ``` Marc Espie and Christian Weisgerber of the OpenBSD project reported that jas_stream_printf() function used by jasper uses vsprintf() internally to print data to a fixed-size buffer.  This can result in a buffer overflow in cases where jas_stream_printf() may be called with untrusted user-supplied data.  OpenBSD jasper library patches: <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/graphics/jasper/patches/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=461478#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-08 13:35:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 316079](attachment.cgi?id=316079&action=diff "OpenBSD patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=316079&action=edit "OpenBSD patch") OpenBSD patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=461478#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-08 13:53:20 UTC  ``` netpbm contains an embedded copy of the jasper library for use in jpeg2ktopam and pamtojpeg2k converters.  Even though it contains vulnerable version of jas_stream_printf(), that function is not used in netpbm.  Parts of the jasper sources that contain a call of jas_stream_printf() that can possibly result in an overflow, are not embedded in the netpbm source.  Removing netpbm maintainer from the CC.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=461478#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-26 16:59:56 UTC  ``` jasper-1.900.1-13.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/jasper-1.900.1-13.fc11>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=461478#c5)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-26 17:01:05 UTC  ``` jasper-1.900.1-13.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/jasper-1.900.1-13.fc10>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=461478#c6)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-26 17:01:47 UTC  ``` jasper-1.900.1-13.el5 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 5. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/jasper-1.900.1-13.el5>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=461478#c7)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-26 17:02:27 UTC  ``` jasper-1.900.1-13.el4 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 4. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/jasper-1.900.1-13.el4>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=461478#c8)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-27 06:37:05 UTC  ``` jasper-1.900.1-13.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.
