Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3291:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `index.php` file of Aprox CMS Engine version 5.1.0.4. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, leading to the injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `id` parameter of `index.php`, which is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Database compromise: An attacker can use SQL injection to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data from the database including usernames, passwords and other information present in the `aprox_users` table.
- Potential for further attacks: Depending on the database privileges of the vulnerable user, the attacker might be able to modify the database, or even gain control of the server hosting the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL request to `index.php` with the vulnerable `id` parameter.
- SQL Injection payload: The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract user information from the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Aprox CMS application.
- No authentication: No prior authentication is required. The attack is carried out by crafting malicious parameters in the URL.
- Basic knowledge of SQL Injection: The attacker requires an understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft the attack string.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit string is `www.Target.com/index.php?id=-1'+UNION+SELECT+0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'MrSQL',0,password,login,0,0,0+FROM+aprox_users/*`.
- The vulnerability exists in version 5.1.0.4 of the Aprox CMS Engine.
- The exploit explicitly mentions avoiding the `concat()` function in the exploit.
