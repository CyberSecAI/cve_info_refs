Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2008-3107:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Virtual Machine of the Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Specifically, it's a flaw that allows a context-dependent attacker to gain elevated privileges by exploiting an unspecified issue.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The core issue is that an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to gain higher privileges than they should normally have. This could allow them to perform unauthorized actions on the system.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This allows an attacker to perform actions with the privileges of the user running the application (or even higher if the attack escalates).
*   **File Manipulation:** An attacker could read, write, or execute local files, causing significant damage or information disclosure.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Untrusted Applications:** The vulnerability can be exploited through untrusted Java applications.
*   **Untrusted Applets:** The flaw can also be triggered by visiting a web page containing a maliciously crafted Java applet.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction (Likely):** While not explicitly stated in all sources, the attack typically requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious web page or running a malicious application.
*   **Remote Access (Potentially):** Some sources mention remote exploitation, which implies the attacker could be located remotely, depending on network and service configurations.
*   **Access to the Guest OS:** In the VMware context, an attacker would need to have a user account on the guest operating system.
*   **Service Console Network Access:** In some VMware configurations, remote exploitation requires access to the Service Console network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Sun Java JRE including 1.4.x, 1.5.x and 1.6.x.
*   It is addressed by updating the JRE to version 1.5.0\_16 and 1.6.0_07
*   The issue is related to the JRE's handling of untrusted code, and how it enforces security policies and permissions.

This information is gathered from various sources, and the VMware advisory clarifies that the issue could allow the virtual CPU to jump to an incorrect memory address. This does not lead to a compromise of the host system, but can lead to a privilege escalation on the guest operating system
