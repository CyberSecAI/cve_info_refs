Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** Although the provided content references CVE-2007-1899, it also mentions CVE-2008-3080. CVE-2008-3080 is marked as a duplicate of CVE-2007-1899 in the NVD database. This analysis will treat the vulnerability as described in the provided content which is associated with CVE-2007-1899.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the `user_id` parameter in the `index.php` script and the `post_id` parameter in the `admin.php` script, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The second vulnerability combines SQL injection with XSS. Injected code gets stored in the database and later rendered to the admin's browser, leading to an XSS attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords (as demonstrated in the provided exploit examples).
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify database content.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers may gain administrative privileges by manipulating the database.
- **XSS Attack:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in the admin's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct SQL Injection:** The attacker directly injects SQL code into the `user_id` parameter via a crafted HTML form.
- **Combined SQL Injection/XSS:** The attacker injects SQL code into the `post_id` parameter. This injects a malicious script into the database which, when viewed by an administrator, executes in the admin's browser. This is achieved by inducing the admin to browse a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable application.
- **PHP Configuration:** For successful exploitation, the PHP environment needs to have `magic_quotes_gpc` set to `Off` and `register_globals` set to `On`.
- **User Interaction (for XSS attack):** For the combined SQL injection/XSS attack, the attacker needs to induce a MyBloggie administrator to visit a malicious HTML page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor but there was no response.
- The content provides example code for exploitation including the malicious forms.
- The exploit requires specific PHP configurations which are not default settings.
