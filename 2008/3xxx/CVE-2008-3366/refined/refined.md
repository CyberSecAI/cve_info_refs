{
  "CVE-2008-3366": {
    "Description": "The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Pligg CMS 9.9.0, specifically in the story.php file.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of the 'id' parameter in the `story.php` script, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to retrieve sensitive data from the database, potentially including user credentials (usernames, passwords, emails).",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote, achieved through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `story.php` script by manipulating the 'id' parameter.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker does not need any special authentication or position. They can directly send a crafted request to the vulnerable web server. The attack complexity is low."
