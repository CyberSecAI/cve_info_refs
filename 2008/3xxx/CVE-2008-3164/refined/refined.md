      "exploit_description": "Fuzzylime CMS 3.01a is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI).",
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when including files, leading to directory traversal.",

      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable web application.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating the 'file' parameter in blog.php, the 'heads' parameter in newsheads.php, or the 's' parameter in commupdate.php, by adding directory traversal sequences like '../' and null byte termination '%00'."
