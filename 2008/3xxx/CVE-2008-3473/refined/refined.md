        "Potential for remote code execution or information disclosure depending on the operating system."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-on user (if the vulnerability is exploited for remote code execution) or disclose sensitive information like cookies from other domains/security zones (if exploited for information disclosure).",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker hosts a specially crafted web page that exploits the vulnerability. The attacker convinces a user to visit this page, typically through a link in an email or instant message. The attacker could also use compromised websites or banner ads.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to host a web page and convince a user to visit it. No specific technical capabilities are listed beyond the ability to craft HTML and script code. User interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability."
