The impact of these vulnerabilities is not specifically detailed in the provided content, but it is implied that they could lead to security breaches, therefore it was considered important to patch.

The attack vector would likely involve exploiting the forum software, such as by injecting malicious code into the `$topic` variable, or via the `html` tag.
