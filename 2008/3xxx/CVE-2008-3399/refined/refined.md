Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-3399:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary vulnerability is a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** issue.
*   The vulnerability exists in multiple files due to the use of an unfiltered variable `$msg`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input that is later displayed in the application's output. Specifically, the `$msg` variable is vulnerable to XSS injection.
*   **Information Gathering:** The `tests/info.php` script calls phpinfo(), exposing sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application, which will be executed by the browsers of other users. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Theft of sensitive user data.
*   **Information Gathering:** Attackers can gather sensitive information about the server configuration and software versions, which can assist in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code through the `$msg` variable, the attacker can manipulate the application's behavior in the victim's browser. This likely occurs in GET or POST parameters
*   **Information Gathering:** By directly accessing the `tests/info.php` file an attacker can view the output of `phpinfo()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the `$msg` variable.
*   For information gathering, the attacker needs to be able to access the web application and request `tests/info.php`.
*   The application requires `register_globals` to be enabled for remote file inclusion, which is associated with another CVE.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is found in XRMS 1.99.2.
*   The issue was a zero-day at the time of discovery.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as high risk.
*   There are limitations with the XSS, described as "quote limitations".

**Summary of CVE-2008-3399:**

CVE-2008-3399 refers to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in XRMS 1.99.2. The vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of user-provided input in the `$msg` variable, potentially allowing attackers to execute malicious scripts in the browsers of other users.
