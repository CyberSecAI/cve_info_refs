# OpenTTD: Execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200903-09**

Multiple buffer overflows in OpenTTD might allow for the execution of
arbitrary code in the server.

### Affected packages

| Package | **games-simulation/openttd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.6.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.6.3** |

### Background

OpenTTD is a clone of Transport Tycoon Deluxe.

### Description

Multiple buffer overflows have been reported in OpenTTD, when storing
long for client names (CVE-2008-3547), in the TruncateString function
in src/gfx.cpp (CVE-2008-3576) and in src/openttd.cpp when processing a
large filename supplied to the "-g" parameter in the ttd\_main function
(CVE-2008-3577).

### Impact

An authenticated attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the OpenTTD server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenTTD users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-simulation/openttd-0.6.3"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-05 01:28:09 UTC  ``` Secunia writes: A vulnerability has been reported in OpenTTD, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to compromise a vulnerable system.  The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "TruncateString()" function in src/gfx.cpp. This can be exploited to potentially cause a buffer overflow via a specially crafted string.  Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.  The vulnerability is reported in versions prior to 0.6.2.  SOLUTION: Update to version 0.6.2.  PROVIDED AND/OR DISCOVERED BY: Reported by the vendor.  ORIGINAL ADVISORY: <http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=617243> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-05 01:35:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 162239](attachment.cgi?id=162239 "openttd-0.6.2-truncate-string.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=162239&action=edit "openttd-0.6.2-truncate-string.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=162239&action=diff "openttd-0.6.2-truncate-string.patch")] openttd-0.6.2-truncate-string.patch  Just for reference, the patch in question. It also affects 0.5.3 as it is in our tree, a backport should be trivial if the ebuild cannot be bumped to 0.6. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Mr. Bones. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-05 01:47:18 UTC  ``` masked games-simulation/openttd until it's fixed. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  corec    2008-08-05 05:30:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 162242](attachment.cgi?id=162242 "backported fix for 0.5.x") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=162242&action=edit "backported fix for 0.5.x"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=162242&action=diff "backported fix for 0.5.x")] backported fix for 0.5.x  This is the backported patch of openttd-0.6.2-truncate-string.patch. Compiled fine with me and game playes without problems. This patch also works just fine with 0.5.3 because gfx.c files are identical in 0.5.2 and 0.5.3. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-05 10:36:02 UTC  ``` This might not be the only buffer overflow fixed in 0.6.2, see <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/766> ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-06 11:53:23 UTC  ``` As Nico pointed out in the URL above, further patches would need backporting. Is bumping to 0.6.2 an option for us? ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-08 12:40:09 UTC  ``` CVE-2008-3547 for the Debian issue ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-15 13:06:32 UTC  ``` CVE-2008-3576 for the TruncateString()  Games, any news here? ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-15 13:09:01 UTC  ``` CVE-2008-3577:          Buffer overflow in src/openttd.cpp in OpenTTD before 0.6.2 allows          local users to execute arbitrary code via a large filename supplied to          the "-g" parameter in the ttd_main function.  NOTE: it is unlikely          that this issue would cross privilege boundaries in typical          environments.  ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Mr. Bones.

As OpenTTD now wants to push out an overlay with ebuilds, the hard mask is holding it back (and I can't find a way to override the hard mask from within an overlay). Thank you in advance. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-10-19 10:10:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=233929#c10)) > Would it be possible to change the hard mask to only versions before 0.6.3? > 0.6.3 fixes all CVEs.

A file named package.unmask in profiles/ should work, I guess, so no need to change the masks in our official tree.  games, you should probably bump and unmask, once you've got time.   ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Patric Stout    2008-10-19 11:29:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=233929#c11)) > A file named package.unmask in profiles/ should work, I guess, so no need to > change the masks in our official tree. >  > games, you should probably bump and unmask, once you've got time. >   Exactly my thoughts ... but I couldn't get it to work. Then of course there is a good possibility I am doing something wrong.  # cat profiles/package.unmask games-simulation/openttd  # emerge -av openttd (still fails)  (same for '=games-simulation/openttd-0.6.3' and '<=games-simulation/openttd-0.6.2') ..  But okay, I will just wait for someone to official add 0.6.3 in the portage. Tnx for your reply! ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Tupone Alfredo   gentoo-dev  2008-11-10 20:41:16 UTC  ``` Version 0.6.3 is in portage now and unmasked.

We can either wait this out until portage with EAPI=2 is stable, or create an -r1 that reintroduces built_with_use moves the src_configure code. ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Patric Stout    2008-11-27 19:57:01 UTC  ``` Ah, sorry, you are right. I am trying to get the following ebuild in the official portage for ages now .. I seem to fail to do so ;)  <http://packages.openttd.org/gentoo/overlay/games-simulation/openttd/openttd-0.6.3.ebuild>  It uses EAPI=1, and is what we as OpenTTD publish as official ebuilds at the moment (as at least the general public can use it ...) ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Mathias Hablützel    2009-01-01 15:18:58 UTC  ``` Regarding the status on the openttd website would it be possible to stabilize the ebuild?
