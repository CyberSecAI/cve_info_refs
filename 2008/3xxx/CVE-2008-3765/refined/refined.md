```
- Root cause of vulnerability: SQL injection vulnerability in the 'id' parameter of the code.php script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the vulnerable parameter, allowing them to retrieve sensitive information such as database user, version, and database name. Further exploitation could lead to data manipulation or complete compromise of the database.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the code.php script, by manipulating the 'id' parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required.
