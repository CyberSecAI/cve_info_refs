Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-3505:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `nr` parameter of the PolyPager application, leading to both SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize the `nr` parameter when processing database queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize the `nr` parameter when displaying the content in a web page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords in clear text.
*  **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts that can be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions within the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL, injecting SQL code into the `nr` parameter.
*   **XSS:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with XSS payloads in the `nr` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PolyPager application with a modified `nr` parameter.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges on the server. They can exploit the vulnerability remotely via web requests.

**Additional Notes**

* The exploit-db entry mentions that the SQL injection can dump usernames and passwords in clear text.
* The vulnerable application is PolyPager version 1.0rc2 and earlier.
* The provided exploit-db content includes Proof of Concept URLs for both SQL Injection and XSS attacks.
* The CVE entry is not included in the provided content from securityreason.com.
