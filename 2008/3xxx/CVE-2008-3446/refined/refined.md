{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the insecure use of user-supplied input in the `inc/wysiwyg.php` file. The `$_GET['language']` parameter is directly included in the `include` statement without proper sanitization or validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "CWE-22"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files or source code. Depending on server configuration, it could also allow remote code execution by including a file containing malicious php code.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameter `language` in the `inc/wysiwyg.php` script.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No authentication is required."
