  "cve": "CVE-2008-3658",
  "description": "Buffer overflow in the imageloadfont function allows a denial of service or code execution through a crafted font file.",
  "information": [
    {
      "type": "Root cause",
      "text": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `imageloadfont` function of PHP's GD extension due to insufficient bounds checking when handling crafted font files."
    },
    {
      "type": "Weaknesses",
      "text": "The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, stemming from improper handling of font data within the `imageloadfont` function. Specifically, there was a lack of proper bounds checking before reading font data, leading to an overflow when a malicious font file is provided, where the size of `font->nchars * font->h * font->w` was not checked"
    },
     {
      "type": "Impact",
      "text": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to achieve a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application or potentially execute arbitrary code. The impact of the exploit can vary depending on the specific application context and how it uses the imageloadfont function, with possible remote code execution being a serious concern when the function processes user-supplied data."
    },
    {
      "type": "Attack vectors",
      "text": "The primary attack vector involves providing a crafted font file to a PHP application that uses the vulnerable `imageloadfont` function. This can occur in web applications through file uploads or other means of user input which is then processed by the `imageloadfont`."
    },
    {
      "type": "Attacker capabilities",
      "text": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted font file to a vulnerable PHP application. This can be achieved if the application processes user-provided data, including font files.  No special privileges are required. However, the attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable `imageloadfont` function."
