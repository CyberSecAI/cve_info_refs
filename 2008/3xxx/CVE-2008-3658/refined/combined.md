CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-3658 CVE-2008-3659 CVE-2008-3660
Debian Bug     : 499987 499988 499989

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, a server-side,
HTML-embedded scripting language. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-3658

    Buffer overflow in the imageloadfont function allows a denial
    of service or code execution through a crafted font file.

CVE-2008-3659

    Buffer overflow in the memnstr function allows a denial of
    service  or code execution via a crafted delimiter parameter
    to the explode function.

CVE-2008-3660

    Denial of service is possible in the FastCGI module by a
    remote attacker by making a request with multiple dots
    before the extension.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.2.0-8+etch13.

For the testing (lenny) and unstable distribution (sid), these problems
have been fixed in version 5.2.6-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 package.

Use CVE-2008-3658, to be filled in later - I'm assuming this is a distinct
component that doesn't just affect PHP.

>    * Overflow in php's internal memnstr() function which is exposed

Use CVE-2008-3659.

For the FastCGI "foo..php" issue, use CVE-2008-3660.

These will be filled in later.

We use the term "context-dependent" to cover cases where the reachability
and remote/local nature of the issue can vary widely, depending on how the
product is used.  This term typically applies to libraries or interpreters
that are used by third-party applications.

| [Description](#c0)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-06 16:36:18 UTC  ``` Welcome to our monthly php security bug...  I'll be adding php-5.2.6-r6 in a minute, which contains several possibly security-relevant fixes:  #1 The patch for the recent pcre issue ([bug 228091](show_bug.cgi?id=228091 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-libs/libpcre <7.7-r1 pcre_compile.c Heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2008-2371)"), CVE-2008-2371) has been    updated (it now uses the official patch from pcre upstream, instead of    the attached version to our bug).    As far as I can see, this does not introduce any security-relevant    improvements.  #2 Specially crafted font fails can lead to an overflow in ext/gd's    imageloadfont() function; this is at least a DoS issue which might even    allow for code execution; Pierre (gd maintainer) thinks it might well    be possible that the font file is user-supplied in certain webapps,    as such this could be a remote code execution vulnerability at worst.  #3 PHP (as cgi/fastcgi) crashes when accessing foo..php (double-dot);    probably just a crash issue, at worst this could be called DoS  #4 PHP's ext/xmlrpc's xmlrpc_server_register_introspection_callback    function crashes w/ invalid callbacks (local crash issue only)  #5 It was possible to circumvent safe_mode by using stream    wrappers in functions which did not expect any.    See [bug 228369](show_bug.cgi?id=228369 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-lang/php <5.2.6-r3: safe_mode bypass (CVE-2008-{2665,2666})") for details (CVE-2008-2665, CVE-2008-2666)  #6 PHP's internal memnstr() function allowed for overflows. It is used by    the PHP function explode() (which is very common and often works on    user-supplied data). This at least allows for DoS and maybe even for    code execution (local or remote, depending on the webapp).    Some upstream developers seem to try to actively make this issue look    less critical [1].  [1] <http://news.php.net/php.cvs/52039> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-06 17:47:35 UTC  ``` Bleh, one of the patches introduces a strange segfault, which I am unable to track down quickly. This will have to wait for tomorrow then. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-07 10:25:19 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 229287](show_bug.cgi?id=229287 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-07 10:31:48 UTC  ``` #7 There was some memory corruption issue (would probably rather hard to    exploit)    See      <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=45178>      <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=33595>   php-5.2.6-r6 is in the tree (the weird segfault I was referring to just happens in some edge cases and is not a regression, so this shouldn't prevent us from stabling this).  Issue #6 was previously tracked in [bug 229287](show_bug.cgi?id=229287 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE"), btw.  Ready for stablization from my side. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-07 12:34:20 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and stabilize: =dev-lang/php-5.2.6-r6  Target keywords: alpha amd64 arm hppa ia64 ppc ppc64 s390 sh sparc x86 ~x86-fbsd To do: alpha arm hppa ia64 ppc ppc64 s390 sh sparc x86  Please note that there have been two versions of php-5.2.6-r6 in the tree. Both install the very same files, but the first version did not build on some systems. In short: If you see a build problem related to "yyerror" symbols, cvs up first. ;) ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Markus Rothe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-07 18:40:24 UTC  ``` ppc64 stable ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Markus Meier   gentoo-dev  2008-08-07 21:49:52 UTC  ``` x86 stable, amd64 was already done by hoffie. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-07 22:29:51 UTC  ``` Stable for HPPA. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-08 18:05:54 UTC  ``` alpha/ia64/sparc stable ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Tobias Scherbaum (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-08 19:20:35 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-13 09:25:21 UTC  ``` CVE-2008-3658: #2 (gd issue) CVE-2008-3659: #6 memnstr() overflow CVE-2008-3660: #3 FastCGI-related "foo..php" crash ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-10-07 17:29:04 UTC  ``` Debian classifies this as RCE (#2 and #6).  <http://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1647> ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Tobias Heinlein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-11-16 16:15:07 UTC  ``` GLSA 200811-05, thanks everyone, especially hoffie. ``` |  |

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- imlib2
Specially crafted xpm files could trigger a stack based buffer overflow
in imlib2 which could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2008-2426).
- mono
A bug in the ASP.net class library of mono allowed cross site
scripting attacks (CVE-2008-3422).
- tomcat5
Tomcat was updated to fix a cross site scripting issue and directory traversal
problems (CVE-2008-1232, CVE-2008-2370, CVE-2008-2938)
- libtiff
Specially crafted lzw files could trigger a buffer underflow in
libtiff (CVE-2008-2327).
- libxml2
Specially crafted xml files could cause a crash or a heap based
buffer overlow in libxml2 (CVE-2008-3281, CVE-2008-3529).
- clamav
Clamav has been updated to version 0.94. It fixes numerous problems
including some security relevant ones (CVE-2008-3912, CVE-2008-1389,
CVE-2008-3913, CVE-2008-3914).
This new version changed the library version number once again so
dependent packages had do be updated as well (clamav,
sylpheed-claws, claws-mail).
- emacs
When editing Python files Emacs accidently imported other Python
script in the current directory (CVE-2008-3949).
- php5
php5 has been updated to fix some overflows in the gd extension and
the memnstr() function that could crash php or even cause a buffer
overflow (CVE-2008-3658, CVE-2008-3659 and CVE-2008-3660)
- uvcvideo
The kernel driver uvcvideo was vulnerable to a buffer overflow in
format descriptor parsing code (CVE-2008-3496).
- postfix
When exectuting external programs postfix didn't close the file
descriptor of the epoll system call. This could potentially be
exploited to shutdown postfix (CVE-2008-3889).

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

# PHP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200811-05**

PHP contains several vulnerabilities including buffer and integer overflows
which could lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.2.6-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.2.6-r6** |

### Background

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

### Description

Several vulnerabilitites were found in PHP:

* PHP ships a
  vulnerable version of the PCRE library which allows for the
  circumvention of security restrictions or even for remote code
  execution in case of an application which accepts user-supplied regular
  expressions (CVE-2008-0674).
* Multiple crash issues in several
  PHP functions have been discovered.
* Ryan Permeh reported that
  the init\_request\_info() function in sapi/cgi/cgi\_main.c does not
  properly consider operator precedence when calculating the length of
  PATH\_TRANSLATED (CVE-2008-0599).
* An off-by-one error in the
  metaphone() function may lead to memory corruption.
* Maksymilian Arciemowicz of SecurityReason Research reported an
  integer overflow, which is triggerable using printf() and related
  functions (CVE-2008-1384).
* Andrei Nigmatulin reported a
  stack-based buffer overflow in the FastCGI SAPI, which has unknown
  attack vectors (CVE-2008-2050).
* Stefan Esser reported that PHP
  does not correctly handle multibyte characters inside the
  escapeshellcmd() function, which is used to sanitize user input before
  its usage in shell commands (CVE-2008-2051).
* Stefan Esser
  reported that a short-coming in PHP's algorithm of seeding the random
  number generator might allow for predictible random numbers
  (CVE-2008-2107, CVE-2008-2108).
* The IMAP extension in PHP uses
  obsolete c-client API calls making it vulnerable to buffer overflows as
  no bounds checking can be done (CVE-2008-2829).
* Tavis Ormandy
  reported a heap-based buffer overflow in pcre\_compile.c in the PCRE
  version shipped by PHP when processing user-supplied regular
  expressions (CVE-2008-2371).
* CzechSec reported that specially
  crafted font files can lead to an overflow in the imageloadfont()
  function in ext/gd/gd.c, which is part of the GD extension
  (CVE-2008-3658).
* Maksymilian Arciemowicz of SecurityReason
  Research reported that a design error in PHP's stream wrappers allows
  to circumvent safe\_mode checks in several filesystem-related PHP
  functions (CVE-2008-2665, CVE-2008-2666).
* Laurent Gaffie
  discovered a buffer overflow in the internal memnstr() function, which
  is used by the PHP function explode() (CVE-2008-3659).
* An
  error in the FastCGI SAPI when processing a request with multiple dots
  preceding the extension (CVE-2008-3660).

### Impact

These vulnerabilities might allow a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code, to cause a Denial of Service, to circumvent security
restrictions, to disclose information, and to manipulate files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/php-5.2.6-r6"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Message-ID: <489C4AC1.1030000@gentoo.org>

Subject: CVE request: php-5.2.6 overflow issues

Heya,

two security issues, which might possibly allow for arbitrary code
execution (afaik nobody has analyzed the details...), but at least DoS
(think of FastCGI setups), were silently fixed in PHP again:

   * Overflow in ext/gd's imageloadfont() function [1] [2] [3]
   * Overflow in php's internal memnstr() function which is exposed
     to userspace as "explode()" [1] [2] [4] [5]

As those functions might take user-supplied data in certain webapps
(which is a valid use case at least in case of explode()), those issues
should probably expected to be remotely exploitable.

Those issues are fixed by the recent php-4.4.9 release, but they affect
php-5.2.6 as well and the fixes are not part of any released version in
case of 5.2.

Can we get CVEs for these please? :)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- cups
Specially crafted print jobs could trigger buffer overflows in the
'imagetops', 'texttops' and 'hpgltops' filters. Attackers could
potentially exploit that to execute arbitrary code on the cups
server (CVE-2008-3639, CVE-2008-3640, CVE-2008-3641).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-11.0, SLED 10 SP1,SLED 10 SP2,
SLES 10 SP1,SLES 10 SP2,SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8 for IBM
S/390 and IBM zSeries,SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8 for x86,
Novell Linux Desktop 9,Novell Linux POS 9,Open Enterprise Server,SLES 9
- hplip,hplip-hpijs,hplip17,hplip17-hpijs
hplip was updated because it does allow to send alert mails as user
(CVE-2008-2940) and was affected by a denial-of-service bug
(CVE-2008-2941).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-10.3,SLED 10 SP1,SLED 10 SP2,SLES 10 SP1,
SLES 10 SP2
- apache2-mod\_php5,php5\*
The current update of apache2-mod\_php5 fixes some overflows in the
gd extension and in the memnstr() function that could crash php or
possibly allow remote code execution (CVE-2008-3658, CVE-2008-3659)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-11.0 (previously released), SLE SDK 10
SP1,SLES 10 SP1
- openldap2
This update fixes a security problem in the liblber client library of
openldap that allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(program termination) via crafted ASN.1 BER datagrams, which triggers
an assertion error. (CVE-2008-2952)
Additionally a bug was fixed in ldap\_free\_connection which could result
in client crashes when the server closed a connection while an operation
is active.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-11.0, Novell Linux Desktop 9, Novell
Linux POS 9,Open Enterprise Server,SLE 10 DEBUGINFO SP2,SLE SDK 10 SP1,
SLE SDK 10 SP2,SLED 10 SP1,SLED 10 SP2,SLES 10 SP1,SLES 10 SP2,SLES 9,

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

# [PHP 5.2.8 Released!](http://www.php.net/archive/2008.php#id2008-12-08-1)

[08-Dec-2008]

The PHP Development Team would like to announce the immediate availability of PHP 5.2.8. This release addresses a regression introduced by 5.2.7 in regard to the magic\_quotes functionality, which was broken by an incorrect fix to the filter extension. All users who have upgraded to 5.2.7 are encouraged to upgrade to this release. Alternatively you can apply a work-around for the bug by changing "filter.default\_flags=0" in php.ini.

# [PHP 5.2.7 has been removed from distribution](http://www.php.net/archive/2008.php#id2008-12-07-1)

[07-Dec-2008]

Due to a security bug found in the PHP 5.2.7 release, it has been removed from distribution.
The bug affects configurations where [magic\_quotes\_gpc](/magic_quotes) is enabled,
because it remains off even when set to on.
In the meantime, use PHP [5.2.6](/releases/5_2_6.php) until PHP 5.2.8 is later released.

# [PHP 5.3 alpha3 released!](http://www.php.net/archive/2008.php#id2008-12-04-2)

[04-Dec-2008]

The PHP development team is proud to announce the [third alpha release](http://qa.php.net/)
of the upcoming PHP 5.3.0 minor version update of PHP.
Several new features have already been documented in the [official documentation](http://php.net/docs.php),
others are listed on the [wiki](http://wiki.php.net/doc/scratchpad/upgrade/53)
in preparation of getting documented. It is imperative that more people
join the effort to complete the documentation for PHP 5.3.0.
Please also review the [NEWS](http://php.net/php5news) file.

**THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT PREVIEW - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!**

The purpose of this alpha release is to encourage users to not only actively
participate in identifying bugs, but also in ensuring that all new features or
necessary backwards compatibility breaks are noted in the documentation. Please
report any findings to the QA mailinglist
or the [bug tracker](http://bugs.php.net).

There have been a great number of other additions and improvements since the last alpha,
but here is a short overview of the most important changes:

* [Namespaces](http://php.net/language.namespaces) (documentation has been updated to the current state)
* [Rounding behavior](http://wiki.php.net/rfc/rounding)
* ext/msql has been removed, while ext/ereg will now raise E\_DEPRECATED notices
* ext/mhash has been replaced by ext/hash but full BC is maintained
* PHP now uses cc as the default compiler, instead of gcc
* A number of bug fixes to ext/pdo, ext/soap, the stream layer among others

Several under the hood changes also require in depth testing with existing
applications to ensure that any backwards compatibility breaks are minimized.

The current [release plan](http://wiki.php.net/todo/php53) expects
a stable release sometime around the end of Q1 2009.

# [PHP 5.3 alpha1 released!](http://www.php.net/archive/2008.php#id2008-08-01-1)

[01-Aug-2008]

The PHP development team is proud to announce the [first alpha release](http://qa.php.net/) of the upcoming minor version update of PHP. [Windows binaries](http://windows.php.net/download/) will be available starting with alpha2 (intermediate snapshots available at [snaps.php.net](http://snaps.php.net)). The new version PHP 5.3 is expected to improve stability and performance as well as add new language syntax and extensions. Several new features have already been documented in the [official documentation](http://php.net/docs.php), others are listed on the [wiki](http://wiki.php.net/doc/scratchpad/upgrade/53) in preparation of getting documented. Please also review the [NEWS](http://php.net/php5news) file.

**THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT PREVIEW - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!**

The purpose of this alpha release is to encourage users to not only actively
participate in identifying bugs, but also in ensuring that all new features or
necessary backwards compatibility breaks are noted in the documentation. Please
report any findings to the QA mailinglist
or the [bug tracker](http://bugs.php.net).

There have been a great number of other additions and improvements, but here is a short overview of the most important changes:

* [Namespaces](http://php.net/language.namespaces) (documentation maybe out dated)
* [Late static binding](http://php.net/oop5.late-static-bindings) and [\_\_callStatic](http://php.net/language.oop5.overloading)
* [Lambda functions and closures](http://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures)
* Addition of the [intl](http://php.net/book.intl), [phar](http://php.net/book.phar) (phar is scheduled for some more work a head of alpha2), [fileinfo](http://php.net/book.fileinfo)  and [sqlite3](http://php.net/book.sqlite3) extensions
* Optional cyclic garbage collection
* Optional support for the [MySQLnd](http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/PHP_MYSQLND) replacement driver for libmysql
* Windows older than Windows 2000 (Windows 98, NT4, etc.) are not supported anymore ([details](http://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/releasenotes))
* New syntax features like [NOWDOC](http://php.net/language.types.string#language.types.string.syntax.nowdoc), limited GOTO, ternary short cut "?:"

Several under the hood changes also require in depth testing with existing applications to ensure that any backwards compatibility breaks are minimized. This is especially important for users that require the undocumented Zend engine multibyte support.

The current [release plan](http://wiki.php.net/todo/php53) states that there will be alpha/beta/RC releases in 2-3 week intervals with an expected stable release of PHP 5.3 between mid September and mid October of 2008.

# [TestFest 2008 wrap-up](http://www.php.net/archive/2008.php#id2008-07-30-1)

[30-Jul-2008]

Overall 158 tests have been submitted as part of [TestFest 2008](http://qa.php.net/testfest.php) since the launch of the [TestFest submission site](http://testfest.php.net) by 30 different people from people all over the world. Actually this is not counting the various submissions by existing core developers, who also took this opportunity to add some more tests. This has actually increased total [test coverage](http://gcov.php.net/) for ext/reflection, ext/dom and ext/exif by about 10% each. While the organization of the TestFest was a bit adhoc, there were numerous TestFest events in local user groups. So the number of people exposed to the PHP test framework is much greater. Hopefully this will lead to more people submitting bug reports with an accompanying [phpt](http://qa.php.net/write-test.php) test file!

Our top submitter Felix De Vliegher has actually committed his last submissions himself since, based on the high quality of his submissions, he has been granted commit rights to the PHP repository. We have not heard back from all participants, but we encourage everybody to [blog](http://www.deshong.net/?p=76) about their experience and provide us with feedback on how to improve future events.

Now better late than never, here are the 10 winners of the promised [elePHPant](http://flickr.com/groups/elephpants/pool/) raffle sponsored by [Nexen](http://www.nexen.net). Note that Felix asked me not to include him in the raffle, since he is already herding quite a number of elePHPants at home.

* Eric Stewart
* Håvard Eide
* Marc Veldman
* Michelangelo van Dam
* Rein Velt
* Rob Young
* Sami Greenbury
* Sebastian Deutsch
* Sebastian Schürmann
* Stefan Koopmanschap

We will provide Nexen with the email addresses of the winners, so that they can arrange to get the elePHPants shipped. Also for those people wondering, you can continue to submit tests on the [TestFest submission site](http://testfest.php.net). A bit thank you to all participants and TestFest organizers! Without the countless people that helped organize local events, implement the infrastructure and submissions reviewers, the TestFest would have obviously not worked out as well as it has. We will surely do similar events in the future based on the big success of TestFest 2008.

# [Manual restructure and license change](http://www.php.net/archive/2008.php#id2008-07-29-1)

[29-Jul-2008]

A few weeks ago the [manual](/manual) was restructured
to improve navigation and make room for
[per-extension chapters](/pdo.prepared-statements)
and [usage examples](/haru.examples) along with
[improved documentation](/class.xmlreader) for
[object oriented](/oop5/) extensions.

The most noticable changes are the [function reference](/funcref),
[predefined variables](/reserved.variables),
[context options and parameters](/context) and
[predefined exceptions](/reserved.exceptions) manual pages,
for which [we would really appreciate feedback](/contact) on.

The upcomming PHP5.3 release introduces
[several major features](http://wiki.php.net/doc/scratchpad/upgrade/53)
such as [namespaces](/namespaces), closures,
[late static bindings](/lsb), [internationalization functions](/intl),
[INI sections](/ini.sections), and [Phar](/phar) among others.
We would really appreciate any and all help we can get improving the documentation.

In related news, the manual was relicensed recently and is now
covered by the

# [TestFest 2008](http://www.php.net/archive/2008.php#2008-03-30-1)

[30-Mar-2008]

The PHP-QA team would like to announce the
[TestFest](http://qa.php.net/testfest.php) for the month of
May 2008. The TestFest is an event that aims at improving the
[code coverage](http://gcov.php.net) of the
[test suite](http://qa.php.net/running-tests.php) for the PHP
language itself. As part of this event, local User Groups (UG) are
invited to join the TestFest. These UGs can meet physically or come
together virtually. The point however is that people network to learn
together. Aside from being an opportunity for all of you to make friends
with like minded people in your (virtual) community, it also will
hopefully reduce the work load for the PHP.net mentors.

All it takes is someone to organize a UG to spearhead the event and
to get others involved in
[writing phpt tests](http://qa.php.net/write-test.php).
The submissions will then be reviewed by members of php.net before
getting included in the official test suite. Please visit the
[TestFest homepage](http://qa.php.net/testfest.php) to get
additional details on the TestFest on how to get involved, either as a
UG or by setting up the necessary infrastructure.
