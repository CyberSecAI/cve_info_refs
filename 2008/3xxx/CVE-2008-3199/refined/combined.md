How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Welcome to reSIProcate.org

---

This is the home of the reSIProcate projects.

The reSIProcate components, particularly the SIP stack, are in use in both commercial and open-source products.
The project is dedicated to maintaining a complete, correct, and commercially usable implementation of SIP and a
few related protocols.

## Why choose reSIProcate

* Extensive range of transports: UDP, TCP, TLS, DTLS and now [WebSockets (WS/WSS) for WebRTC](/resiprocate/resiprocate/wiki/WebRTC-and-SIP-Over-WebSockets)
* Flexibility: use reSIProcate as low-level SIP parsing API, mid-level API for dialog management or high-level API for conversation management/rapidly developing softphones, PBXes and B2BUAs - and [Plugin support using C++ and Python too](/resiprocate/resiprocate/wiki/Plugins)
* Depth: extensive coverage of many SIP-related RFCs, including features like OUTBOUND, Identity and more
* Multiple platforms, including Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, Mac OS, Android, iPhone
* Multiple CPUs supported, including mainstream x86 chipsets, Itanium, PowerPC, MIPS, ARM, S/390 and more (see [here](https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=resiprocate))
* Generous BSD-like license terms
* Thousands of test cases validated on every release on multiple platforms
* First-class C++: understandable and extendable to meet your needs using OO-design
* Convenient packages available on Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu and other platforms
