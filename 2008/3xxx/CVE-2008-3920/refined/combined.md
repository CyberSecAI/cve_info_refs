# Change log

---

This ChangeLog mostly lists changes relevant to users. A full log can be found in the git commit logs, for example you can try:

<https://github.com/bitlbee/bitlbee/commits/master>

## Version 3.6:

* irc/core:
  + Add server-time IRCv3 capability (blastrock)
  + Add PROXY command for haproxy/stunnel
  + Large performance improvements for large contact lists
  + Many UX/documentation improvements
  + Added built-in crash handler that writes to /var/lib/bitlbee/crash.log
  + Try to join long spaceless lines in paste\_buffer without a newline. The main use case for this is pasting long URLs and not breaking them
  + Fix status message being set to null accidentally
  + Fix handling utf8 nick renames when loading configs (MaskRay)
  + Fix SSL’s SNI with hostnames starting with a digit (CMB)
  + Show correct nick when `rename -del` is used (arcnmx)
* twitter:
  + Disable the stream setting by default. Filter streams still work.
  + Update default character limit to 280 chars (qyliss)
  + Fix quote tweet url display.
* jabber:
  + Try to join anyway after “Already present in chat”
  + Fix chat joins when ext\_jid is provided for your own user. Seen with Biboumi (a gateway from XMPP to IRC)
  + Handle always\_use\_nicks more gracefully to reduce nick change noise
* otr:
  + Don’t block attempts to connect/smp/smpq to “offline” users
* Removed dead protocols:
  + msn: Use the skypeweb purple plugin instead.
  + skype (the dbus based thing): ditto.
  + yahoo: It’s so dead even the replacement protocol died.
  + oscar: AIM is dead, for ICQ use the icyque purple plugin instead.
* For plugin devs:
  + Add datadir to pkgconfig file and config.h (sm00th)
  + Add “bitlbee-set-account-password” purple signal (for hangouts)
  + Support libpurple 2.12.0’s PURPLE\_MESSAGE\_REMOTE\_SEND for groupchat self-messages (for slack)
* Packaging/distro specific stuff:
  + bitlbee@.service now sends stderr to syslog instead of the socket
  + debian: only enable bitlbee.service, not bitlbee.socket too
  + cygwin: portability fixes for plugins
  + Support OpenSSL 1.1 built without backwards compat (cotequeiroz)

Finished 7 Feb 2019

## Version 3.5.1:

* purple:
  + Fix crash on file transfer requests from unknown contacts. This was the result of an incomplete fix in the previous release and may result in remote DoS. Read the full security advisory at: <https://bugs.bitlbee.org/ticket/1282>
* After some investigation we decided to reclassify a crash fix from the previous release as a security issue. Read the full security advisory at: <https://bugs.bitlbee.org/ticket/1281>
* Included help.txt in the release tarball, which was missing in the previous release and resulted in adding python as a build dependency. The release tarball of 3.5.1 does not require python.

Finished 30 Jan 2017

## Version 3.5:

* ui:
  + “chat list”: shows a list of existing server-side chatrooms. With some protocols, this is often the only way to add new channels. See ‘help chat list’ for details. (jgeboski)
  + “plugins”: lists the installed plugins and their versions (jgeboski)
  + Add ‘nick\_lowercase’ and ‘nick\_underscores’ settings.
  + “handle\_unknown” can be set per-account, not just globally
* jabber:
  + Add “always\_use\_nicks” channel setting, for non-anonymous MUCs (trac #415) See ‘help set always\_use\_nicks’ for possible side effects.
  + Properly handle rejected file transfers
  + Don’t send parts in a chat if someone is still connected from other devices
  + hipchat: support personal oauth tokens (manually generated ones)
* twitter:
  + Hide muted tweets / no-retweets, add mute/unmute commands (Flexo)
  + Show full version of extended tweets (with slightly more than 140 chars)
* purple:
  + Support setting chat room topics (EionRobb)
  + Support for extra groupchat settings. Shows an error if any required ones are missing. Look for purple\_ prefixed settings in “chan #… set”
  + SIPE: persistent chats can be joined now, thanks to the “chat list” command and the above (“purple\_uri” channel setting)
  + Fix a file transfer crash bug (Mainly affected telegram)
  + Honor protocol flag to not require a password (used in hangouts, telegram)
  + Set the contacts’ nicks to the %full\_name for a few whitelisted protocols (hangouts, funyahoo, icq, line)
  + LINE: added a hack to save its auth token, to avoid re-auth every time
  + Show self-messages in groupchat backlogs (before join)
* yahoo:
  + Removed because they killed their old protocol on a two month notice. Use EionRobb’s funyahoo purple plugin, or better yet, don’t use yahoo.
* Stuff for enterprise deployments (all done by Sevas)
  + Locked down accounts, useful when pregenerating user config files. An account that is marked with the locked=“true” attribute can’t be removed and its username/password can’t be changed.
  + Locked down settings. Same as above, but for individual account settings.
  + AllowAccountAdd setting in bitlbee.conf, to disable adding new accounts.
  + PAM and LDAP authentication backends (not compiled by default)
* For packagers:
  + Enabled debug symbols in non-debug builds, disabled stripping by default. This is closer to the default behavior of autotools, and –debug=1 is mostly to set the DEBUG macro and disable optimization.
* For plugin devs:
  + Plugins should now include an “init\_plugin\_info” function which will be used for ABI version checking in the future. It’s optional for now, but will be enforced later. See the commit log of d28fe1c for details. (jgeboski)

Finished 8 Jan 2017

## Version 3.4.2:

* irc:
  + Self-messages (messages sent by yourself from other IM clients), given support by the IM protocols and your IRC client. See this for details: <https://wiki.bitlbee.org/SelfMessages>
  + IRCv3.1 support and part of 3.2: cap-3.2, sasl-3.2, multi-prefix, away-notify, extended-join, userhost-in-names
  + Send numeric errors when failing to join a channel, to not confuse clients
  + Channel autojoins should be more reliable now.
* jabber:
  + Carbons (XEP-0280), for self-message support. It’s not widely supported by most public XMPP servers (easier if you host your own), but this will probably change in the next few years. Thanks kormat for the original patch.
  + Fix typing notifications between two bitlbee users or with gtalk users
  + Remove facebook XMPP code, point people at bitlbee-facebook.
  + Show groupchat kick/ban/leave reasons
  + SASL ANONYMOUS (XEP-0175), for “guest” logins, see “help set anonymous”
  + Hipchat: ‘chat add hipchat “channel name”’ now tries to guess the JID
* purple:
  + Fix problems remembering SSL certificates as trusted
  + Fix /join #channel, which joined a differently named channel
  + Fix crash when doing “chat with” with skypeweb
  + Fix html entities appearing in some protocols
  + Fix setting away states in jabber, which failed silently
  + Implement notify\_message UI op, to be able to show some error messages.
* skype:
  + Show all messages as groupchats since we can’t tell which ones are private.
  + This plugin is mostly-deprecated and mostly-broken but it’s still useful for p2p-based groupchats, which aren’t delivered over newer protocols. Everyone else should use the skypeweb purple plugin or msn instead.
* msn:
  + Minor tweaks. Faster login, better error reporting, fixed add/remove. Still MSNP21. Disregard that “Next release!” in the previous release.
* otr:
  + Don’t use NOTICE for user messages (revmischa)
  + Fix crashes when using the jabber xmlconsole
  + A few minor fixes: color multiline messages, filter incoming color codes.
* Packaging:
  + Show ./configure args in bitlbee -V, config.h and Makefile.settings
  + Allow setting the plugin dir in bitlbee.conf, for NixOS (anderspapitto)
  + Improved cross compiler support (gamaral)
* Other important bugfixes:
  + Fix potential crashes when leaving temporary channels
  + Fix all sorts of crashing bugs when cancelling in-progress connections.

Finished 19 Mar 2016

## Version 3.4.1:

* msn:
  + Upgraded protocol to MSNP21, works again (dx)
  + Contact list management, groupchats and skype username logins won’t work. Next release!
* jabber:
  + Add “hipchat” protocol, for smoother login. Takes the same username as the official client. Note that unlike the ‘hip-cat’ branch, this doesn’t preload channels. <https://wiki.bitlbee.org/HowtoHipchat> for details (dx)
  + Fixed a bug when receiving topics set by people who left the channel (dx)
  + Create fake users instead of showing “unknown participant” errors (dx)
  + Gmail mail notifications support (Artem Savkov)
  + Lowering xmpp presence priority on away (Artem Savkov)
* twitter:
  + Show quoted tweets/RTs with comment inline (wilmer)
  + Added “url” command, can be used to quote tweets (wilmer)
  + Make replies to self work (wilmer)
* Building documentation is now done with a python script (both 2.x/3.x work) Asciidoc/xsltproc/xmlto are no longer build dependencies (dx)

Finished 16 Jun 2015

## Version 3.4:

* First release pretty much fully prepared by dx instead of Wilmer. Just look at the tightly structured changelog!
* Main repository migrated from bzr to git
* Some API/ABI changes. Recompiling third party plugins is required!
* Important bugfixes:
  + Fix memory leak when calling word\_wrap() on groupchat messages (dx)
  + Fix segfault after a file transfer is complete (dx)
  + Fix bug where NSS would refuse to work in forkdaemon mode (dx)
  + Fix several bugs with UTF8 nicks (dx)
  + Fix some nasty deadlocks that appared mostly with libpurple (dx)
* General changes:
  + Add a ‘pattern’ parameter to the blist command, to filter it (tribut)
  + Implemented /kick support, only supported by purple for now (jgeboski)
  + Add a “special” state to show\_users (mapped to the % prefix) (jgeboski)
  + Improved support for cygwin, openbsd and darwin (jcopenha)
  + Create temporary users instead of showing “Message from unknown participant” (jgeboski)
* purple:
  + Local contact lists for gadugadu and whatsapp (dx)
  + Add topic and name\_hint to groupchats (seirl)
  + Support for ‘input’ requests (such as telegram auth codes) (seirl) Note that telegram-purple itself is rather unstable ATM, it may crash.
* jabber:
  + Handle compressed DNS responses in SRV lookup (jcopenha)
  + Fix case sensitivity issues with JIDs (GRMrGecko, dx)
  + Implement XEP-0203 style message timestamps (dx)
  + Fix “Server claims your JID is X instead of Y” warnings (dx)
  + Account-wide display\_name setting, mostly for hipchat (dx)
* twitter:
  + Filter channels. Search by keyword/hashtag or a list of users (jgeboski)
  + Fix bug in “reply” command which removed the first quote character (dx)
  + Add “rawreply” command, like reply but bitlbee won’t add @mention (WillP)
  + Add support for The United States of America (favorite/fav aliases) (dx)
  + Default show\_old\_mentions to 0 (dx)
  + Start stream from last tweet on connect/reconnect (roger)
* msn:
  + Disabled module by default. The protocol we used (MSNP18) stopped working last week. This is being worked on, but it’s far from ready for release.
* And lots of small bugfixes, too many to list here.

Finished 25 Mar 2015

## Version 3.2.2:

* The OTR plugin now uses libotr 4.0 (AKA libotr5 in debian based distros)
* Rejecting buddy requests in jabber won’t accept them. Sorry for that.
* Purple builds can now enable built in protocols when configuring, by passing a parameter such as –jabber=1 to configure
* You can now use /oper to change passwords with “ac x set -del password”
* Complex unicode characters (non-BMP) now display correctly in twitter.
* A few init / build script / pkg-config fixes. Added “install-systemd” make target.

Finished 5 Jul 2014

## Version 3.2.1:

* Most important change: http\_client updated to use HTTP/1.1, now required by Twitter.
* fill\_by setting can now be used to fill a channel contacts *not* in a certain group/on a certain account/etc. See “help set fill\_by”
* Added utf8\_nicks setting which lets you use non-ASCII nicknames for your contacts. Might not work with all IRC clients, use at your own risk!
* Lots of bugfixes.

Finished 27 Nov 2013

## Version 3.2:

* By far the most important change, a thorough update to the Twitter module:
  + Now using Twitter API 1.1,
  + which means it’s now using JSON instead of XML,
  + which means access to the streaming API (Twitter only, other Twitter API services don’t seem to have it). No more 60-second polls, #twitter looks even more like real IRC now!
  + Also, the streaming API means nice things like receiving DMs.
  + show\_ids, already enabled by default for a while, now uses hexa- decimal numbers, which means a 256-entry backlog instead of just 100.
  + Added a mode=strict setting which requires everything to be a command. The “post” command should then be used to post a Tweet.
* Jabber module bugfix that fixes connection issues with at least Google Talk but reportedly some other servers (OpenFire?) as well.
* SSL modules improved a little bit. GnuTLS module now supports SNI and session caching. Shouldn’t change much, but hopefully reduces latency and bandwidth usage a little bit.
* A bunch of other fixes/improvements here and there.

Finished 6 Jan 2013

## Version 3.0.6:

* Updated MSN module to speak MSNP18:
  + Biggest change is that this brings MPOP support (you can sign in to one account from multiple locations).
  + Restored support for *sending* offline messages.
  + Some support for federated (i.e. Yahoo!) contacts. (Only messages might work, you won’t see them online.)
* Twitter:
  + Work-around for stalls that are still happening sometimes.
  + Added “favourite” command.
  + “show\_ids” enabled by default.
* Handle see-other-host Jabber messages which should fix support for MSN-XMPP.
* Misc. fixes and improvements.

Finished 14 Oct 2012

## Version 3.0.5:

* SSL certificate verification (edit your bitlbee.conf to enable it). Works only with GnuTLS!
* OAuth2 support in Jabber module (works with Google Talk, Facebook and MSN Messenger).
* Support for ad-hoc Jabber groupchats. Just create a channel and start inviting people, similar to how this works on other IM networks. Works fine with GTalk, depends on a conference server being set up on other networks.
* Allow old-style Jabber login (non-SASL), this solves problems with some old/buggy Jabber servers. (acc jabber set sasl off)
* Use HTTPS for OAuth1 authentication traffic.
* Awareness of Twitter’s t.co URL lengt^Wshortening when checking message length.
* Fixed identi.ca OAuth support. OAuth will now always be used for both Twitter and identi.ca accounts.
* Fix nick\_format=%full\_name with libpurple.
* Instead of “protocol(handle)”, use the account tags introduced in 3.0 when root wants to refer to an account (in log messages, queries, etc.)
* Many small bugfixes, improvements, etc.

Finished 18 Feb 2012

## Version 3.0.4:

* Merged Skype support. This used to be a separate plugin, and it still is, but by including it with BitlBee by default it will be easier to keep it in sync with changes to BitlBee.
* Fixed a file descriptor leak bug that may have caused strange behaviour in BitlBee sessions running for a long time.
* Now fetches Twitter mentions as well if the “fetch\_mentions” account setting is enabled.
* With t.co now all over Twitter, show the original (but truncated) URL between .
* Fixed MSN Messenger login issues (“timeout” while fetching buddy list).
* Another (related) GnuTLS compatibility fix (now 2.13+?).

Finished 4 Dec 2011 (Exactly 6 years since 1.0!)

## Version 3.0.3:

* Fixed Twitter compatibility. (The API call used to get the following list was deprecated.)
* Twitter: Enable the show\_ids setting to assign a two-digit short ID to recent tweets to use for retweets and replies (so you can RT/reply to more than just a person’s last message).
* Some other Twitter fixes/improvements.
* “otr reconnect” command and some other fixes.
* GnuTLS 2.12 compatibility fix.
* Include “FLOOD=0/9999” in the 005/ISUPPORT line at login to hint the IRC client that rate limiting is not required. (Next step: Get IRC clients to parse it.)
* Other stuff too small to mention.

Finished 12 Jun 2011

## Version 3.0.2:

* Fixed MSN login issues with @msn.com accounts.
* /CTCP support: You can CTCP VERSION Jabber contacts, and CTCP NUDGE MSN contacts. More may come later, ideas are welcome.
* By default, leave Twitter turned on for libpurple builds.
* Allow using /OPER to identify/register as well. (Password security hack.)
* Fixed proxy support with libpurple.
* Some minor changes/fixes.

Finished 7 Mar 2011

## Version 3.0.1:

* Fixed some bugs that were found only after releasing 3.0, including Jabber contacts never going offline, MSN login issues, compilation issues on some non-Linux systems, a fairly big memory leak in the MSN SOAP code, etc…
* Better handling of multiple control channels and set private=false.
* Using login.icq.com for ICQ logins again since AOL sold ICQ so it doesn’t live on the AIM servers anymore.
* Fixed ability to join password-protected Jabber rooms.
* Time out if logging into an account takes too long.
* Fixed NSS SSL module.
* Support for server-side Gadu-Gadu contact lists (via libpurple, there’s still no native gg support).
* Allow omitting password when using “account add”, the password can be entered using /OPER to prevent echoing to screen and logs.

Finished 24 Nov 2010

## Version 3.0:

* Important: This version drops backward compatibility with the file format used for user settings in versions before 1.2. If you’re upgrading from very old BitlBee versions (like 1.0.x), you’ll have to recreate your BitlBee account - or use an 1.2.x BitlBee once to do the conversion.
* Rewrote the IRC core, which brings:
  + Support for multiple (control) channels, so you can have one channel per buddy group, per IM account/protocol, or for example a &offline with all offline contacts. See “help channels” for information on how to use this.
  + You can also leave and rejoin all channels. Being in &bitlbee is no longer required.
  + Now you can start groupchats by just joining a new channel and inviting contacts. (The “chat with” command still works as well.)
  + You can change your nickname, whenever you want.
  + Root commands:
  + To hopefully resolve confusion about the “account set” syntax, the ordering was changed slightly: “account set acc/setting value” becomes “account acc set setting value”. Obviously the same order should now be used for other account subcommands.
  + Shortcuts: Instead of “account list” you can say “acc li”.
  + /whois shows idle/login times of your contacts when available.
  + paste\_buffer (previously known as buddy\_sendbuffer) now works for chats as well.
  + The nick\_source setting was replaced with a nick\_format setting, which looks more or less like a format string, and lets you tweak how nicknames for contacts are generated in more detail. It also tries to convert non- ASCII characters (i.e. accents) properly.
  + A per-channel show\_users setting lets you configure exactly which kinds of contacts (online/away/offline) should show up in a channel and what modes (none/voice/etc) they should have. Like show\_offline, but together with other new features it can for example create an &offline channel with just offline contacts.
  + If you connect (and identify) to a BitlBee server you’re already connected to, you can take over the existing session instead of starting a new one.
  + More correct validation of channel names: They can contain pretty much any character, unlike nicknames.
* Support for using libpurple instead of BitlBee’s built-in IM protocol modules. This can be enabled by passing –purple=1 to the configure script.
  + This adds support for many more IM protocols to BitlBee.
  + And new functionality to existing protocols.
  + This is and will always be optional and using it on public servers is *not* recommended. It should be pretty stable, but costs more RAM/etc.
  + Switching to libpurple should be pretty transparent. See “help purple” for a list of supported protocols (works only in libpurple-enabled binaries).
* Rewritten MSN module, implementing MSNP15 instead of the old MSNP8:
  + MSNP8 support from MSN was getting pretty unreliable. There were issues with remembering display names and adding contacts/auth requests (or even contacts silently getting blocked!). This upgrade should fix all of that.
  + Support for sending offline messages.
  + Support for setting and reading status messages.
* Integrated the bitlbee-otr branch in a mostly non-intrusive way. Since this is not end-to-end it should *not* be enabled on public servers. Distro packagers are requested to offer OTR as a separately installable plugin. (Compile with –otr=plugin) Please do not enable it by default as there is no easy way to disable OTR once the plugin is loaded/built in.
* Support for file transfers, in and out. /DCC SEND a file to a contact and it becomes a file transfer, and incoming file transfers become /DCC SENDs to you. Note that this is mostly useful when combined with libpurple, as only the Jabber native protocol module currently supports file transfers.
* Updated Yahoo! module to be in sync again with libyahoo2. This mostly fixes issues with authorization requests.
* Show if a contact is mobile or not. See “help set mobile\_is\_away”.
* Easier handling of XMPP chatroom invitations.
* The chatroom mode of the Twitter module is now enabled by default, since this was by far the most popular. To disable it, see “help set mode”.
* Added some Twitter-specific commands that can only be used in the Twitter window. Most important addition: Retweets. See “help set commands”.
* Removed some ancient account/nick migration scripts and added one for easier switching from Pidgin and other libpurple-based clients to BitlBee.
* Many bug fixes in both the core and IM modules, small feature enhancements and other minor changes.

Finished 22 Oct 2010

## Version 1.2.8:

* Now always using the AIM-style authentication method for OSCAR connections, even when connecting to ICQ. This solves login issues some people were having. (If you have problems, try changing the old\_icq\_auth setting.)
* Twitter:
  + Allow changing the Twitter API base URL so the module can also be used for identi.ca or any other compatible network.
  + Fetch the full list of Twitter contacts instead of slowly adding all contacts as they post a message.
  + Fixed message length counting.
  + Allow following/unfollowing people using the usual add/remove commands.
  + Better error reporting.
* Added a user\_agent setting to the Jabber module to get around artificial client restrictions.
* Allow nick changes (although only before register/identify).
* Some more minor bugfixes/etc.

Finished 4 Jul 2010

## Version 1.2.7:

* Fixed problems with MSN Messenger authentication. (“Could not parse Passport server response”)
* Fixed broken typing notifications when talking to GTalk contacts.
* Fixed an issue with non-anonymous Jabber chatrooms polluting the nick namespace, sometimes generating odd warning messages.
* Restored ability to start groupchats on ICQ.
* Added show\_offline setting that will also show offline contacts in the control channel.
* OAuth support for Twitter: This means the module will keep working after June (this also changes “via API” under your tweets into “via BitlBee”).

Finished 15 May 2010

## Version 1.2.6a:

* Fixed a typo that renders the Twitter groupchat mode unusable. A last- minute change that came a few minutes late.

Finished 19 Apr 2010

## Version 1.2.6:

* Native (very basic) support for Twitter, implemented by Geert Mulders. Currently supported are posting tweets, reading the ones of people you follow, and sending (not yet receiving!) direct messages.
* Fixed format of status messages in /WHOIS to improve IRC client compatibility.
* Show timestamps of offline messages/channel backlogs.
* Allow saving MSN display names locally since sometimes this stuff breaks server-side. (Use the local\_display\_name per-account setting.)
* Suppress empty “Headline:” messages for certain new XMPP broadcast messages.
* Better handling of XMPP contacts with multiple resources on-line. Default behaviour now is to write to wherever the last message came from, or to the bare JID (usually becomes a broadcast) if there wasn’t any recent msg.
* Added a switchboard\_keepalives setting which should solve some issues with talking to offline MSN contacts. (Although full support for offline messages is not ready yet!)
* The usual misc. bug fixes.

Finished 19 Apr 2010

## Version 1.2.5:

* Many bug fixes, including a fix for MSN login issues, Jabber login timing issues, Yahoo! crashes at login time with huge contact lists,
* Avoid linking in a static version of libresolv now that glibc has all relevant functions available in the dynamic version.
* Improved away state code and added the ability to set (non-away) status messages using “set status” (also possible per account) and see them in blist and /whois output.
* Added a post-1.2 equivalent of encode/decode to quickly encrypt/decrypt passwords in a way that BitlBee can read them.
* Allow using the full name for generating nicknames, instead of just the handle. This is especially useful when using the Facebook XMPP server.
* Auto reconnect is now enabled by default since all protocols can properly detect cases where auto reconnect should be avoided (i.e. concurrent logins).
* Changed the default resource\_select setting which should reduce message routing issues on Jabber (i.e. messages going someone’s phone instead of the main client).

Finished 17 Mar 2010

## Version 1.2.4:

* Most important change (and main reason for releasing now): Upgraded Yahoo! module to a newer version to get it working again.
* join\_chat command replaced with the much better chat command:
  + Similar to how account replaced login/slist/logout. Add a chatroom once, then just /join it like any other room. Also automatic joining at login time is now possible.
  + Note that the old way of starting groupchats (/join #nickname) is now also deprecated, use “chat with” instead.
  + See “help chat” and “help chat add” for more information.
* Rewrote bitlbee.conf parser to be less dumb.
* Fixed compatibility (hopefully) with AIM mobile messages, certain kinds of Google Talk chatrooms.
* Fixed numerous stability/reliability bugs over the last year.

Finished 17 Oct 2009

## Version 1.2.3:

* Fixed one more flaw similar to the previous hijacking bug, caused by incon- sistent handling of the USTATUS\_IDENTIFIED state. All code touching these variables was reviewed and should be correct now.

Finished 7 Sep 2008

## Version 1.2.2:

* Security bugfix: It was possible to hijack accounts (without gaining access to the old account, it’s simply an overwrite)
* Some more stability improvements.
* Fixed bug where people with non-lowercase nicks couldn’t drop their account.
* Easier upgrades of non-forking daemon mode servers (using the DEAF command).
* Can be cross-compiled for Win32 now! (No support for SSL yet though, which makes it less useful for now.)
* Exponential backoff on auto-reconnect.
* Changing passwords gives less confusing feedback (“password is empty”) now.

Finished 26 Aug 2008

## Version 1.2.1:

* Fixed proxy support.
* Fixed stalling issues while connecting to Jabber when using the OpenSSL module.
* Fixed problem with GLib and ForkDaemon where processes didn’t die when the client disconnects.
* Fixed handling of “set charset none”. (Which pretty much breaks the account completely in 1.2.)
* You can now automatically identify yourself to BitlBee by setting a server password in your IRC client.
* Compatible with all crazy kinds of line endings that clients can send.
* Changed root nicknames are now saved.
* Added ClientInterface setting to bind() outgoing connections to a specific network interface.
* Support for receiving Jabber chatroom invitations.
* Relaxed port restriction of the Jabber module: added ports 80 and 443.
* Preserving case in Jabber resources of buddies, since these should officially be treated as case sensitive.
* Fully stripping spaces from AIM screennames, this didn’t happen completely which severely breaks the IRC protocol.
* Removed all the yellow tape around daemon mode, it’s pretty mature by now: testing.bitlbee.org serves all (~30) SSL users from one daemon mode process without any serious stability issues.
* Fixed GLib <2.6 compatibility issue.
* Misc. memory leak/crash fixes.

Finished 24 Jun 2008

## Version 1.2:

* Added ForkDaemon mode next to the existing Daemon- and inetd modes. With ForkDaemon you can run BitlBee as a stand-alone daemon and every connection will run in its own process. No more need to configure inetd, and still you don’t get the stability problems BitlBee unfortunately still has in ordinary (one-process) daemon mode.
* Added inter-process/connection communication. This made it possible to implement some IRC operator features like WALLOPs, KILL, DIE, REHASH and more.
* Added hooks for using libevent instead of GLib for event handling. This should improve scalability, although this won’t really be useful yet because the one-process daemon mode is not reliable enough.
* BitlBee now makes the buddy quits when doing “account off” look like a netsplit. Modern IRC clients show this in a different, more compact way. (This can be disabled if your client doesn’t support this.)
* GLib 1.x compatibility was dropped. BitlBee now requires GLib 2.4 or newer. This allows us to use more GLib features (like the XML parser). By now GLib 1.x is so old that supporting it really isn’t necessary anymore.
* Many, many, MANY little changes, improvements, fixes. Using non-blocking I/O as much as possible, replaced the Gaim (0.59, IOW heavily outdated) API, fixed lots of little bugs (including bugs that affected daemon mode stability). See the bzr logs for more information.
* One of the user-visible changes from the API change: You can finally see all away states/messages properly.
* Added units tests. Test coverage is very minimal for now.
* Better charset handling: Everything is just converted from/to UTF-8 right in the IRC core, and charset mismatches are detected (if possible) and the user is asked to resolve this before continuing. Also, UTF-8 is the default setting now, since that’s how the world seems to work these days.
* One can now keep hashed passwords in bitlbee.conf instead of the cleartext version.
* Most important change: New file format for user data (accounts, nicks and settings). Migration to the new format should happen transparently, BitlBee will read the old files and once you quit/save it will save in the new format. It is recommended to delete the old files (BitlBee doesn’t do this automatically, it will just ignore them) since they won’t be used anymore (and since the old file format is a security risk). Some advantages of this file format switch:
  + Safer format, since the identify-password is now salted before generating a checksum. This way one can’t use MD5 reverse lookup databases to crack passwords. Also, the IM-account passwords are encrypted using RC4 instead of the simple obfuscation scheme which BitlBee used so far.
  + Easier to extend than the previous format (at least the .nicks format was horribly limited).
  + Nicknames for buddies are now saved per-account instead of per-protocol. So far having one buddy on multiple accounts of the same protocol was a problem because the nicks generated for the two “instances” of this buddy were very unpredictable. NOTE: This also means that “account del” removes not just the account, BUT ALSO ALL NICKNAMES! If you’re changing IM accounts and don’t want to lose the nicknames, you can now use “account set” to change the username and password for the existing connection.
  + Per-account settings (see the new “account set” command).
* A brand new Jabber module. Besides the major code cleanup, it also has has these new features:
  + Pretty complete XMPP support: RFC3920, RFC3921 plus a number of XEPs including XEP45, XEP73 and XEP85. (See <http://www.xmpp.org/> for what all these things mean exactly.) Privacy lists are not supported for obvious reasons.
  + This complete support also includes TLS and SASL support and SRV record lookup. This means that specifying a server tag for connections should (almost) never be necessary anymore, BitlBee can find the server and can automatically convert plaintext connections to TLS-encrypted ones.
  + XEP45: Jabber chatroom support!
  + XEP85 means typing notifications. The older XEP22 (still used by some clients including Gaim <2.0) is not supported.
  + Better handling of buddies who have more than one resource on-line. As long as one resource is on-line (and visible), BitlBee will show this. (The previous module didn’t keep track of resources and sent an offline event as soon as any resource disappears.)
  + You can now set your resource priority.
  + The info command now gives away state/message information for all resources available for that buddy. (Of course this only works if the buddy is in your contact list.)
  + An XML console (add xmlconsole to your contact list or see “help set xmlconsole” if you want it permanently).
* The Yahoo! module now says it supports YMSG protocol version 12, which will hopefully keep the Yahoo module working after 2008-04-02 (when Yahoo! is dropping support for version 6.x of their client).
* MSN switchboard handling changes. Hopefully less messages will get lost now, although things are still not perfect.

Finished 17 Mar 2008

## Version 1.0.4:

* Removed sethostent(), which causes problems for many people, especially on \*BSD. This is basically the reason for this release.
* “allow” command actually displays the allow list, not the block list.
* Yahoo away state/msg fix.
* Don’t display “Gender: Male” by default if nothing’s filled in (OSCAR “info” command)
* Fixed account cleanup (possible infinite loop) in irc\_free().
* Fixed configdir error message to not always display the compile-time setting.

Finished 20 Aug 2007

## Version 1.0.3:

* Fixed ugliness in block/allow list commands (still not perfect though, the list is empty or not up-to-date for most protocols).
* OSCAR module doesn’t send the ICQ web-aware flag anymore, which seems to get rid of a lot of ICQ spam.
* added show\_got\_added(), BitlBee asks you, after authorizing someone, if you want to add him/her to your list too.
* add -tmp, mainly convenient if you want to talk to people who are not in your list.
* Fixed ISON command, should work better with irssi now.
* Fixed compilation with tcc.
* Fixed xinetd-file.
* Misc. (crash)bug fixes, including one in the root command parsing that caused mysterious error messages sometimes.

Finished 24 Jun 2006 (Happy 4th birthday, BitlBee!)

## Version 1.0.2:

* Pieces of code cleanup, fixes for possible problems in error checking.
* Fixed an auto-reconnect cleanup problem that caused crashes in daemon mode.
* /AWAY in daemon mode now doesn’t set the away state for every connection anymore.
* Fixed a crash-bug on empty help subjects.
* Jabber now correctly sets the current away state when connecting.
* Added Invisible and Hidden to the away state alias list, invisible mode should be pretty usable now.
* Fixed handling of iconv(): It’s now done for everything that goes between BitlBee and the IRC client, instead of doing it (almost) every time something goes to or come from the IM-modules. Should’ve thought about that before. :-)
* When cleaning up MSN switchboards with unsent msgs, it now also says which contact those messages were meant for.
* You can now use the block and allow commands to see your current block/ allow list.

Finished 1 Apr 2006

## Version 1.0.1:

* Support for AIM groupchats.
* Improved typing notification support for at least AIM.
* BitlBee sends a 005 reply when logging in, this informs modern IRC clients of some of BitlBee’s capabilities. This might also solve problems some people were having with the new control channel name.
* MSN switchboards are now properly reset when talking to a person who is offline. This fixes problems with messages to MSN people that sometimes didn’t arrive.
* Fixed one of the problems that made BitlBee show online Jabber people as offline.
* Fixed problems with commas in MSN passwords.
* Added some consts for read-only data, which should make the BitlBee per- process memory footprint a bit smaller.
* Other bits of code cleanup.

Finished 14 Jan 2006

## Version 1.0:

* Removed some crashy debugging code.
* QUIT command now works before logging in. (Mainly an RFC-compliancy fix.)
* Hopefully slightly clearer handling of buddy add requests.
* set buddy\_sendbuffer\_delay now also supports milisecond precision.
* Renamed #bitlbee to &bitlbee to avoid confusion with the channel on OFTC.
* Reviewed the xinetd file and installation instructions.
* HTML stripping is configurable again.
* Quit messages (at least on crashes) should appear again.
* Cleaned up some unnecessary code in the Jabber module, and implemented handlers for headline messages (which allows you to use RSS-to-Jabber gateways).
* Lowered the line splitting limit a bit to fix data loss issues.
* The *p**r**o**t**o*(handle) format used for messages specific to one IM-connection now only include the ($handle) part when there’s more than one $proto- connection.
* Fix for a crash-bug on broken Jabber/SSL connections.
* Incoming typing notifications now also come in as CTCP TYPING messages, for better consistency. Don’t forget to update your scripts!
* AIM typing notifications are supported now.
* Jabber module only accepts ports 5220-5229 now, to prevent people from abusing it as a port scanner. We aren’t aware of any Jabber server that runs on other ports than those. If you are, please warn us.
* Send flood protection can’t be enabled anymore. It was disabled by default for a good reason for some time already, but some package maintainers turned it back on while it’s way too unreliable and trigger-happy to be used.
* Removed TODO file, the current to-do list is always in the on-line bug tracking system.
* Fixed a potential DoS bug in input handling.

Finished 4 Dec 2005

## Version 0.99:

* Fixed memory initialization bug in OSCAR module that caused crashes on closing the connection.
* Most likely fixed the bug that caused BitlBee to use 100% CPU time in some situations.
* Outgoing MSN typing notifications are now understood correctly by the original MS Mac/Windows clients (again).
* Added “account add $protocol” to the documentation, got rid of a lot of over-markup (i.e. overuse of bold-tags), reviewed some other parts.
* Small changes to help.xsl to fix small flaws in the help.txt formatting.
* Messaging yourself now doesn’t make irssi or mIRC crash anymore.

Finished 3 Nov 2005

## Version 0.93:

* " is now correctly converted to " instead of ’.
* Code cleanup in OSCAR module.
* Some changes for better RFC-compliancy.
* It’s now possible to specify an alternate Jabber server.
* bitlbee\_save() now also checks the return value of fclose(), which might solve more problems with lost account data.
* Fixed a file descriptor leak in bitlbee.c.
* Signedness fixes (mainly to keep GCC4 happy).
* Away messages are now sent correctly to most ICQ clients.
* BitlBee knows now which connection sends HTML, so it will strip HTML automatically, “set html strip” is no longer necessary. Also, outgoing HTML is escaped correctly.
* info-command works for AIM-connections too now.
* /notices to users will be sent as auto-away replies.
* Messages about a connection now also mention a handle, for people who have multiple accounts in use of the same protocol.
* Examples are back in help.txt.

Finished 31 Oct 2005

## Version 0.92:

* Fixed some formatting issues with the help.txt XSL-sheet.
* Moved the polling of the IRC connections to glib instead of a separate select().
* Added ctags generation to the Makefiles.
* Sending a CTCP TYPING message to a user in your buddy list now sends a typing notification to that person, if the protocol supports it. You probably want to write/use a script for your IRC client to do this.
* A dash is no longer considered a lowercase underscore in nicknames.
* CTCP’s to buddies no longer alter their private/non-private state.
* Clean shutdown (with saving settings) on SIGTERM.
* Fixed a crash on connecting to unreachable Jabber/SSL servers.
* On ICQ, offline messages are now requested after receiving the buddy list. This should get rid of the “Message from unknown OSCAR handle” messages on login.
* The linked list of buddies/nicks is now always sorted, which makes the blist output a bit more useful.
* Fixed a crash on renaming NickServ. (There’s no reason to do this, but still crashing isn’t really how BitlBee should tell you that. ;-)
* Now the message about the “new” ICQ server-side buddy lists is only displayed when the server-side list is still empty.
* The Yahoo! markup language stripper is now less likely to strip things that shouldn’t be stripped.
* Working around a shortcoming in the Yahoo! cleanup code that didn’t cause any serious problems in previous versions, but got pretty nasty (100% CPU time usage) now with everything in the glib main loop.
* Fixed a bug in http\_encode that might have caused buffer overflows (although not likely to be exploitable) when trying to encode strings with non-ASCII characters.
* Fixed AIM screenname handling on ICQ connections.
* When blocking someone, the MSN module now closes the conversation you’re having with him/her (if any) so he/she can’t continue talking to you (for as long as the conversation lasts).
* Away messages are only sent when messaging someone outside the control channel. (And now also when the user is offline instead of just away.)
* Moved charset conversion in serv\_buddy\_rename() to the right place so bogus changes are always detected now.
* iso8859-1 is now the default charset because -15 caused some problems and because -1 is enough for most people anyway.
* Fixed crashes on attempting to add a buddy (or do other things) on connections that are still initializing.
* Added support for server-side notifies using the WATCH command.
* IRC\_MAX\_ARGS is dead, at least for IRC commands.
* Fixed a bug that made BitlBee crash on failing fresh MSN switchboard connections.
* Fixed an invisibility bug in the MSN code that handled transfers to other servers in the middle of a session.
* Newline stripping added to prevent newline-in-friendlyname attacks. (Which allowed remote people to make BitlBee send raw custom IRC lines.)

Finished 23 Feb 2005

## Version 0.91:

* Full support for ICQ server-side contact lists! NOTE: BitlBee now ignores your client-side contact list. If you want to import your ICQ contact list, use the import\_buddies command.
* Added the import\_buddies command for upgrading purposes.
* Added support for OpenSSL.
* Fixed one major problem with the daemon mode by getting rid of the global IRC structure.
* Documentation fixes. help.txt is now generated from XML. Also updated the installation manual.
* Made the quickstart up-to-date. (By Elizabeth Krumbach)
* Some bitlbeed additions. (By Marcus Dennis)
* info-command support for Jabber, MSN, Yahoo! and a more verbose info-reply for ICQ. (By Frank Thieme)
* Support for Jabber over SSL.
* nick\_get() appends a \_ on duplicates instead of chopping off the last character.
* Got rid of an unused piece of code that caused crashes. (oscar.c:gaim\_parse\_clientauto)
* When splitting long messages into 450-char chunks, BitlBee now tries not to cut off in the middle of a line.
* Added a warning when the user specifies an unknown OSCAR server.
* Removed GLib 2.x dependency, BitlBee will work with GLib 1.x again.
* Improved strip\_html(), now less likely to strip non-HTML things.
* An invalid account-command will now display an error message.
* Fixed a bug that caused crashes when /CTCP’ing a groupchat channel.
* Hopefully better Unicode/non-ASCII support for ICQ.
* Fixed MSN connection crash on non-ASCII characters in screenname.
* Added some missing charset conversion calls. (serv\_got\_crap, serv\_buddy\_rename)
* “account off” without extra arguments now logs off all connections.
* Fixed a crash-bug on disconnecting Yahoo! connections before they’re fully connected.
* Fixed a bug in helpfile handling which sometimes caused crashes in daemon mode.
* block and allow commands work with just a nick as an argument again.
* Working around a crash on some probably invalid Yahoo! packets.
* Fixed a possible double free() on shutdown in irc\_free().
* Talking to ICQ people on AIM and vice versa and talking to people with @mac.com accounts now possible.
* Low ASCII chars are now stripped from away-messages so the Jabber module won’t barf on BitchX and lame-script away messages anymore.

Finished 25 Sep 2004

## Version 0.90a:

* Fixed the Yahoo! authentication code.

Finished 28 Jun 2004

## Version 0.90:

* A complete rewrite of the MSN module. This gives BitlBee the following new features/improvements:
  + You can now start groupchats with MSN people without having to send them a bogus message first.
  + People who are in your MSN block/allow list, but not in your contact list, shouldn’t show up in your BitlBee buddy lists anymore.
  + Passport authentication shouldn’t lock up the whole program for a couple of seconds anymore. Additionally, it should also work behind proxies now.
  + Better recognition of incoming file transfers; they’re now recognized when coming from non-English MS Messenger clients too.
  + Fixed a problem with MSN passwords with non-alphanumeric characters.
  + Mail notification support (also for Yahoo!)…
  + Parsing of maintenance messages (ie “Server is going down in x minutes”).
  + Hopefully more stability.
* Changes in the OSCAR module:
  + Better reading of ICQ-away-states.
  + Lots of cleanups.
* Yahoo! module:
  + Fixed authentication on 64-bit machines. (Patch from Matt Rogers)
  + Better stripping of markup tags.
* Lots of cleanup in all IM-modules.
* Added support for using libnss instead of libgnutls.
* Reverse hostname lookups work on IPv6 sockets too now. (And don’t crash the program anymore.)
* Fixed a little problem with identifying right after registering a nick.
* Restored complete proxy support and added a proxy setting to the conffile.
* BitlBee can now tell you when people in your buddy list change their “friendly name”.
* Instead of an account number, you can also specify the protocol name or (part of) the username as an account identification with commands like “account on”, “add”, etc.
* BitlBee remembers what connection a question (i.e. authorization request) belongs to and cleans it up when the connection goes down; this fixes (one of) the last known crash bugs.
* Plus some other changes in question management. (The query\_order setting is one of them. The default behaviour changed a bit, for more information please read “help set query\_order”.)
* Also fixed a memory management bug in the question code which caused some crashes.
* Optimized some nick handling functions and added a hash of all the users to speed up user\_find() a bit (especially good for people with large buddy and notify lists).
* Lots of changes for the Win32 port (see <http://jelmer.vernstok.nl/>).
* Added the drop-command.
* Fixed small problem with versions of sed which don’t support the + “operator” (the BSD version, for example, even though the operator is documented properly in the re\_format manpage…).
* Added the default\_target setting.
* Added a CenterICQ2BitlBee conversion script.
* Put back the evaluator for “set charset” (which got lost somewhere between 0.84 and 0.85), so an incorrect charset will be rejected again.
* ISON now (A) gives one single reply and (B) also replies when none of the persons asked for are on-line.
* Using GConv instead of iconv now.
* Incoming messages larger than 450 characters are now split into parts before sending them to the user.
* Fixed a bug in irc\_exec() which could crash the program when some commands were called with too little arguments.
* Fixed a dumb NULL pointer dereference in the JOIN command.
* Added rate limiting to bitlbeed. (Against server hammering)
* Added handling of CTCP PINGs (yet another self-ping used by some IRC clients…)
* Added bitlbee\_tab\_completion.pl.
* Removed the vCard handling code from Jabber because it’s (A) not used and
  2. had a possible format string vulnerability.
* Got rid of strcpy() in account.c. (Thanks to NETRIC for reporting these two problems.)
* ISO8859-15 is now the default charset.

Finished 21 May 2004

## Version 0.85a:

* Fixed an authentication problem with logging into some MSN accounts.
* Removed a non-critical warning message from the ICQ servers when logging in with an empty contact list.
* Fixed reading the [defaults] section of bitlbee.conf.
* The last newline in outgoing messages when using the buddy\_sendbuffer is now removed correctly.
* Yahoo! colour/font tag stripping now actually works.
* Fixed compilation on \*BSD and some Linux architectures.

Finished 24 Mar 2004

## Version 0.85:

* Users can specify alternate configuration files/directories at runtime now.
* Rename now doesn’t choke on name changes with only case changes anymore.
* Imported the daemon patch into the main source tree. The daemon mode is still experimental, this just eases maintenance. This daemon patch brings a lot of features, including (as the name says) a real daemon mode and also buffering of the data sent to the user, and flood protection.
* Strips font and colour codes from Yahoo! messages.
* Support for groupchats on Yahoo!
* Fixed removing Yahoo! buddies from a different group than “Buddies”.
* Jabber presence packets with error messages are interpreted correctly now. (They used to be parsed as a signin.)
* bitlbee\_save() checks return values from fprintf() and writes to tempfiles first to make sure no old files get lost when there’s a write error.
* ICQ buddies are added all at once instead of once at a time. This should solve problems with huge buddy lists.
* Made the client pinging timings configurable. (Without requiring recompilation)
* MSN and Yahoo flag the connection as “wants\_to\_die” when they’re logged off because of a concurrent login. This means reconnection will be disabled on concurrent logins.
* BitlBee can now buffer the messages sent to someone before they’re actually sent, and wait for a specified number of seconds for more lines to be added to the buffer before the message will really be sent.
* Renamed the reconnect\_delay setting to auto\_reconnect\_delay.
* Unknown settings aren’t saved anymore.

Finished 13 Mar 2004

## Version 0.84:

* Removed the libsoup dependency.
* Fixed AuthMode=Registered: It will now restore your accounts when identifying.
* Fixed Yahoo! support.
* Fixed a little memory leak in user.c.
* Fixed a security bug in unused code in proxy.c, only people who use the HTTP proxy support and an untrusted proxy might need this. We haven’t done an emergency release for this fix because proxy support is disabled by default.
* Fixed some memory leaks in IM-code.

Finished 13 Feb 2004

## Version 0.83:

* Fixed a crash bug on connecting to unsupported accounts.
* Fixed a problem with connecting to MSN accounts with empty buddy lists.
* Fixed another inifite-loop bug in nick\_get() and added a piece of code which detects the infinite loop and asks the user to send a bug report.
* Fixed iconv-Solaris linking issues.
* Fixed all the problems with spaces in AIM screennames now, we hope.
* Fixed a buffer overflow in the nick handling code. Buffers are overflowed with static data (nulls), so we don’t think it’s exploitable.
* Added server-client pinging, useful for remote servers.
* Added the hostname setting.
* Some bitlbeed changes.
* Added a little part to the on-line quickstart about the settings and other help topics, this hopefully answers a lot of FAQ’s.
* Fixed the signal handler to re-raise the signal after the handler quits. This makes sure the default handler is called after our handler sends the user a bye-message, so core dumps are created and the parent will get more useful information back from wait().
* Added support for ICQ URL messages.
* Fixed strip\_html() behaviour on unknown &entities;.
* Fixed a possible problem with Yahoo!
* Fixed a problem with logging into more than one MSN account at once.

Finished 31 Dec 2003

## Version 0.82:

* Fixed a little bug in nick.c which could cause a complete hang for some tricky buddylists. (Thanks to Geert Hauwaerts for helping with fixing this bug)
* Fixed MSN support. (Lots of thanks to Wouter Paesen!)
* Removed the old login/logout commands.
* Added the qlist command.
* Fixed a buffer overflow in the nick checking code. (Thanks to Jon Åslund for pointing us at this problem)
* Adds the add\_private and add\_channel options for set handle\_unknown.
* Some documentation updates.
* Added two small utilities to encode/decode BitlCrypted files.

Finished 31 Oct 2003

## Version 0.81a:

* This version just fixes some small things we should’ve fixed before releasing 0.81:
* Fixed a small bug in the auto-reconnect cleanup code.
* Fixed the Makefile: Now it doesn’t just overwrite your etc files when installing.
* Fixed the Makefile: $prefix/etc/bitlbee/ is the default etcdir now.
* Disabling MSN by default, now that it doesn’t work. It’ll be back on as soon as we get the module working again.

Finished 16 Oct 2003

## Version 0.81:

* Added a configuration file.
* Added support for the PASS command to restrict access to the daemon to only the people who know this password.
* Only allowing registered people to use the daemon is possible too.
* In case you, at some time, need to check the currently running BitlBee version, just CTCP-VERSION someone in the channel.
* Added the auto\_connect setting for people who don’t want the program to connect to IM-networks automatically.
* Extended the blist command.
* Applied the auto-reconnect patch from G-Lite.
* Applied the iconv patch from Yuri Pimenov.
* Imported the MSN-friendlyname patch from Wouter Paesen.
* Away-message aliasing code now just parses the beginning of the string, not the whole string. This allows you to have a more descriptive away message like “Busy - Fixing bugs in BitlBee” and all the IM connections will have a busy-like away-state.
* Added some information about away states to the help system.
* MSN file transfers aren’t silently ignored anymore.
* Integrated the Yahoo protocol fix from Cerulean Studios (Trillian). (Thanks to Tony Perrie!)
* Made all protocol plugins optional. (Patch from Andrej Kacian/Ticho)

Finished 15 Oct 2003

## Version 0.80:

* Fixed a very stupid bug in the MSN away-state reading.
* nick\_cmp() now actually works, RFC-compliant.
* Fixed and cleaned up the away-state handling, there were some very weird things in the original Gaim code base which broke this completely all the time.
* The daemon prevents you from using root/NickServ as your nick now, previous versions crashed on that.
* At last … GROUP CHAT SUPPORT! :-D
* People who are *not* away get mode +v in #bitlbee now, so you can see in /names who’s away and who’s not.
* Crashing BitlBee by using the NICKSERV command without any arguments is impossible now.
* Added some notes about Darwin/OSX portability.
* Separated connections from accounts. This means restoring a lost connection can be done using a simple “account on ” command. See “help account” for more information. \*\*\* For now this won’t cause problems when upgrading because the login command still exists (as an alias for “account add”). This alias will not stay forever, though.
* irc\_process() now makes sure it reads the whole available buffer before executing the commands. Previous versions were very bad at handling long floods from non-floodprotected clients. The code is still not perfect, but good enough for local links.
* Allow/Deny questions from msn.c now also mention your own screenname. This is useful for people who run two (or even more) MSN accounts in one BitlBee.
* Fixed a little bug in the helpfile-changed-check code.
* A little trick in “make install” makes sure the help function in running sessions doesn’t break while upgrading.
* Added a nifty (and editable) MOTD.
* Added IRIX to the compatibility list.
* Added support for Cygwin.
* Better HTML-stripping, it also handles &entities; correctly now.
* Fixed some problems to make it compile on Solaris.
* Added support for messages from Miranda/Mac ICQ. (Code port from Gaim 0.59)
* Fixed the crash problem when removing yahoo buddies.
* Added the handle\_unknown setting.
* Did some editing on a few docs.
* Added a FAQ.
* Added the daemon-patch by Maurits Dijkstra which adds stand-alone daemon support to BitlBee.
* Jabber now doesn’t barf on high ASCII characters in away messages anymore. (Thanks to Christian Häggström chm@c00.info)

Finished 24 Jun 2003

## Version 0.74a:

* The music-festivals-are-bad-for-your-mind release.
* This one actually contains the fix for the bug 0.74 claimed to have.

Finished 11 Jun 2003

## Version 0.74:

* Fixed a security leak, where using a / in the nickname causes the saved settings and account information to be stored in undesirable places.

Finished 10 Jun 2003

## Version 0.73:

* Fixed the unable-to-remove-icq-users (actually users from any *local* contact list) bug.
* Fixed away bug in aim protocol.
* Fixed the ‘statistics’ under the blist command output.
* Removed the commands from the XML documentation because they’re ‘on-line’ already.
* Added some signal handling; ignoring SIGPIPE should als get rid of some crashes (for some weird reason this has to be done). Also, crashes because of things like segfaults are a bit more verbose now. ;-)
* Changed the select() timeout in main(), this might improve some latencies. (At leasts it speeds up signing on (especially for ICQ) a lot!)
* Made the own-QUIT messages more compliant, probably.
* Fixed some memory-bugs, thanks to valgrind.
* irc\_write() now checks the write() return value, and tries to send the rest of the string, if it could not write it completely the first time.
* Hostname lookups also work on NetBSD now. (Thanks to David.Edmondson*sun*com (hi spambot))
* At last, a new protocol. Welcome to … YAHOO!
* Documentation and code cleanup. Somehow the helpfile documented register and identify twice, now that’s what I call over-documenting.. :-/
* Added the rename command to the helpfile, somehow I forgot that one.
* Been a bit pedantic about compiler warnings. They’re all dead now.
* Fixed a small Makefile problem which gave an error when a clean tree was “made distclean”
* Fixed a (possible) memory leak in nogaim.c:proto\_away()
* Fixed the way proto\_away() calls proto\_away\_alias\_find(), now it gives the *whole* list of away states
* proto\_away() doesn’t give a NULL message anymore because AIM didn’t like that
* Got rid of the last goto in my code (without ruining the code)
* Created a more samba-like compiling process (without the complete command lines, just a simple echo)
* “help set ops” works now too, without quoting the “set ops”
* Trying to log in with a protocol without a prpl (ICQ and TOC, for example) made previous versions crash

Finished 13 Apr 2003

## Version 0.72:

* Updated the documentation.
* Improved the MSN friendlyname code. (Although it doesn’t seem to be perfect yet..)
* info-command added to get more information about ICQ users.
* blist-command added to get a complete buddy list.
* Fixed a bug which broke the AIM code when adding a screenname with a space in it.
* Added the NS alias for the NICKSERV command (Tony Vroon).
* Fixed the USERHOST command implementation (Tony Vroon).
* /me from IM-networks is now converted to a CTCP ACTION correctly.
* Added an utils/ directory with some misc toys and handy things.
* Added a /notice to the on\_typing event. Don’t use it though, the /notice flood will just be a big annoyance. ;-)
* Some people like root and themself to be ops, some don’t. Now it’s configurable. (set ops)
* Now the umode stuff actually works. Next step: Use those modes… (How?)

Finished 19 Dec 2002

## Version 0.71:

* Fixed the help command output layout (alignment)
* Added a sample xinetd file
* Cleaned up, 0.70 released with a build-stamp and DEADJOE file (oops)..
* Messages can be sent like ‘, ’ in the control channel now, instead of just ‘: ’
* Added a debug setting boolean: Set it to true for some debugging crap which used to be on by default..
* Changed the /whois reply: In the server section you now see the connection this user belongs to.
* Added some root/permission checks.
* configure script works correctly when the terminating / is forgotten for a directory.
* Fixed format string bug in protocols/oscar/meta.c (Hmm, what’s the use of that file?)
* Added ‘#include “crypting.h”’ to commands.c to get rid of stupid warnings
* Fixed crash-bug (SIGSEGV when adding an @-less contact to MSN/Jabber)
* Added to\_char setting
* Fixed bug in set.c: It ignored the new value returned by the evaluator :-(
* Removed protocol tag from ‘hostname’ in user hostmask because this info is in /whois’ server section now
* Added the GPL. Somehow 0.7 released without a COPYING file.. :-/
* Enhanced the root\_command() parser, you can ‘quote’ “arguments” now so arguments can be strings with spaces
* Debugging versions have True as the default value for set debug
* NICKSERV is now an alternative for PRIVMSG root. This does not affect functionality of current NICKSERV commands, but does allow people to just do identify  in channel.
* NICKSERV REGISTER now doesn’t try to log you in (to check if the user exists) but checks for the existence of the user-configuration files.
* NICKSERV SET password now works (as does set password in channel). This makes changing your password possible.
* NICKSERV password now stored in irc\_t.
* ./configure now only bugs you about possible problems with strip if it’s actually going to strip (wooohoooo! *sexy* :)
* Fixed a load of warnings in oscar.c, irc.c, nick.c and set.c
* Split up root\_command() into a version which eats raw strings and one which eats split strings
* New help system: Help available for most (all?) commands, all read from an external help-file.
* Changed the maximum message length in irc\_usermsg() from IRC\_MAX\_LINE to 1024 (for loooong help messages..).
* Only allow user to set supported umodes.
* Fixed a memory leak in crypting.c (Thanks to Erik Hensema.)
* Added a send\_handler callback to user\_t. Needed for the following entry:
* Added the NickServ user as a root-clone.
* Disabled tcpd by default because it’s just a PITA for a lot of systems and because you can use /usr/sbin/tcpd as well.
* The root user can be renamed now.

(No support for SSL yet though, which   makes it less useful for now.) - Exponential backoff on auto-reconnect. - Changing passwords gives less confusing feedback ("password is empty") now.
