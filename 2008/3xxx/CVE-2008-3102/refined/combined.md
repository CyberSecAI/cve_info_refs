# Mantis: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200812-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mantis, the most severe of
which leading to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/mantisbt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.4-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.4-r1** |

### Background

Mantis is a PHP/MySQL/Web based bugtracking system.

### Description

Multiple issues have been reported in Mantis:

* EgiX reported that manage\_proj\_page.php does not correctly sanitize the
  sort parameter before passing it to create\_function() in
  core/utility\_api.php (CVE-2008-4687).
* Privileges of viewers are not sufficiently checked before composing a
  link with issue data in the source anchor (CVE-2008-4688).
* Mantis does not unset the session cookie during logout (CVE-2008-4689).
* Mantis does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an HTTPS
  session (CVE-2008-3102).

### Impact

Remote unauthenticated attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to
execute arbitrary PHP commands, disclose sensitive issue data, or
hijack a user's sessions.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mantis users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/mantisbt-1.1.4-r1"
```

#### Mantis: Session hijacking vulnerability, CVE-2008-3102

##### Description

When configuring a web application to use only ssl (e. g. by forwarding
all http-requests to https), a user would expect that sniffing and hijacking
the session is impossible.

Though, for this to be secure, one needs to set the session cookie to have
the secure flag. Else the cookie will be transferred through http if the
victim's browser does a single http-request on the same domain.

The mantis bugtracker does not set that flag. The mantis team has fixed this
issue in 1.1.3.
