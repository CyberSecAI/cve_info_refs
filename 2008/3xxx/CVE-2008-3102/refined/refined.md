Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Mantis bug tracker application does not set the "secure" flag for the session cookie when using HTTPS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Session cookie is missing the "secure" flag. This allows the session cookie to be transmitted over HTTP if the user's browser makes an HTTP request to the same domain.
- Failure to use the "secure" flag on cookies for HTTPS connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Session hijacking: An attacker can intercept the session cookie when it's sent over an insecure HTTP connection (even if the user is primarily using HTTPS).
- After obtaining a valid session cookie, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user and access their account and data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic from the victim's machine and needs to know that the user has a valid session (e.g., they are logged into the application).
- The attacker must be able to observe an unencrypted HTTP request from the victim to the vulnerable Mantis instance on the same domain to steal the session cookie. This is only possible if the user makes at least one http request to the domain after login.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic (e.g., man-in-the-middle attack) on the local network or the internet.
- An attacker might need to induce the victim to make an http request to the domain.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Mantis version 1.1.3 (according to int21.de) or 1.1.4-r1 (according to Gentoo).
- The vulnerability is related to the session handling in HTTPS environment.
- This is not just a theoretical vulnerability. A user could expect that just using SSL would secure the session cookie and, therefore, would protect against hijacking.
