Versions:
these bugs were wrongly reported by me one week ago in version 7.53,
in reality they affect version 7.50 and probably 7.51 too so I have
decided to leave this advisory here ONLY for reference moreover
because seems that all the following bugs have been found and fixed
by the same HP and not reported by other researchers (in fact there
were no details about them online when I found them)
Platforms: Windows (tested), Solaris, Linux, HP-UX
Bugs: A] format string in ovalarmsrv
B] multiple buffer-overflows in ovalarmsrv
C] buffer-overflow in ovuispmd
D] buffer-overflow in ovwdb
Exploitation: remote
Date: 15 Apr 2008 (first advisory 07 Apr 2008)
Author: the original author of the vulnerabilities is unknown,
seems they were found and fixed by the same HP (I'm
waiting the confirm from HP)
Advisory: Luigi Auriemma

===============
1) Introduction
===============
From vendor's website:
OpenView NNM "automates the process of developing a hyper-accurate
topology of your physical network, virtual network services and the
complex relationships between them. It then uses that topology as the
basis for intelligent root cause analysis to enhance network
availability and performance."
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
------------------------------
A] format string in ovalarmsrv
------------------------------
The ovalarmsrv.exe process listening on port 2953 is affected by a
format string vulnerability caused by the calling of ov.fprintf\_new
(which then calls vsprintf) using the final message without a format
argument:
"Connection Refused; Data in listener port corrupt: ATTACKER\_STRING"
------------------------------------------
B] multiple buffer-overflows in ovalarmsrv
------------------------------------------
The same process listens also on port 2954 where are handled some types
of requests using specific sscanf formats:
REQUEST\_SEV\_CHANGE (47): "%d %d %d %[^\n]"
REQUEST\_SAVE\_STATE (61): "%d %[^\n]s"
REQUEST\_LOCAL (66): "%d"
REQUEST\_RESTORE\_STATE (62): "%d %s"
REQUEST\_SAVE\_DIR (63):
As visible by the previous format arguments there are no checks on the
length of the client string handled by the requests 47, 61 and 62 which
can be used to exploit a stack based buffer-overflow vulnerability
using a string parameter longer than 512 bytes.
------------------------------
C] buffer-overflow in ovuispmd
------------------------------
The protocol used by the ovuispmd service running on port 7777 is very
simple, a 32 bit number which specifies the length of the data block
followed by the data.
The destination buffer where are received these data has a size of 16
kilobytes and there are no checks on the amount of bytes to receive so
is possible to exploit the subsequent buffer-overflow.
---------------------------
D] buffer-overflow in ovwdb
---------------------------
The process ovwdb running on port 2447 uses the same protocol of
ovuispmd and is vulnerable to the same bug.
#######################################################################
===========
3) The Code
===========
A]
echo %n%n%s%n%n%s | nc SERVER 2953 -v -v
B]
echo 62 AAAAAAAAAAAAA...512\_'A's...AAAAAAAAAAAAA | nc SERVER 2954 -v -v
C]
send the following hex bytes to port 7777
00 00 5d c0 followed by 24000 'A's
D]
as above but to port 2447
#######################################################################
======
4) Fix
======
Version 7.53 fixes all the bugs for sure.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

=======
------------------------------
A] format string in ovalarmsrv
------------------------------
The ovalarmsrv.exe process listening on port 2953 is affected by a
format string vulnerability caused by the calling of ov.fprintf\_new
(which then calls vsprintf) using the final message without a format
argument:
"Connection Refused; Data in listener port corrupt: ATTACKER\_STRING"
------------------------------------------
B] multiple buffer-overflows in ovalarmsrv
------------------------------------------
The same process listens also on port 2954 where are handled some types
of requests using specific sscanf formats:
REQUEST\_SEV\_CHANGE (47): "%d %d %d %[^\n]"
REQUEST\_SAVE\_STATE (61): "%d %[^\n]s"
REQUEST\_LOCAL (66): "%d"
REQUEST\_RESTORE\_STATE (62): "%d %s"
REQUEST\_SAVE\_DIR (63):
As visible by the previous format arguments there are no checks on the
length of the client string handled by the requests 47, 61 and 62 which
can be used to exploit a stack based buffer-overflow vulnerability
using a string parameter longer than 512 bytes.
----------------------------------
C] Denial of Service in ovalarmsrv
----------------------------------
Another problem of the ovalarmsrv service is that it can be easily
freezed with CPU at 100% and without the possibility of handling
further requests on port 2953/2954 simply sending some invalid values.
