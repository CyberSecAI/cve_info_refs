| CVSS Meta Temp ScoreCVSS is a standardized scoring system to determine possibilities of attacks. The Temp Score considers temporal factors like disclosure, exploit and countermeasures. The unique Meta Score calculates the average score of different sources to provide a normalized scoring system. | Current Exploit Price (≈)Our analysts are monitoring exploit markets and are in contact with vulnerability brokers. The range indicates the observed or calculated exploit price to be seen on exploit markets. A good indicator to understand the monetary effort required for and the popularity of an attack. | CTI Interest ScoreOur Cyber Threat Intelligence team is monitoring different web sites, mailing lists, exploit markets and social media networks. The CTI Interest Score identifies the interest of attackers and the security community for this specific vulnerability in real-time. A high score indicates an elevated risk to be targeted for this vulnerability. |

A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in [Dreambox DM500](?product.dreambox:dm500) ([version now known](?kb.version)). This affects some unknown processing of the component *Web Server*. The manipulation as part of a *long URL* leads to a input validation vulnerability. CWE is classifying the issue as [CWE-20](?vulnerability_cwe.3807 "Cwe"). The product receives input or data, but it does
not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
properties that are required to process the data safely and
correctly. This is going to have an impact on availability. The summary by CVE is:
> The web interface in Dreambox DM500C allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application hang) via a long URI.

The bug was discovered 04/28/2008. The weakness was disclosed 08/29/2008 by Marc Ruef with scip AG (Full-Disclosure). It is possible to read the advisory at [archives.neohapsis.com](?advisory_url.3807). This vulnerability is uniquely identified as [CVE-2008-3936](?source_cve.3807 "Cve") since 09/05/2008. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. No form of authentication is needed for exploitation. Technical details are unknown but a public exploit is available.

After immediately, there has been an exploit disclosed. The exploit is shared for download at [computec.ch](?exploit_url.3807). It is declared as proof-of-concept. We expect the 0-day to have been worth approximately [$25k-$100k](?kb.exploitprices). The vulnerability scanner Nessus provides a plugin with the ID [10320](?source_nessus_id.3807 "Nessus") (Web Server Long URL Handling Remote Overflow DoS), which helps to determine the existence of the flaw in a target environment. It is assigned to the family *Web Servers* and running in the context r.

It is possible to mitigate the weakness by firewalling .

The vulnerability is also documented in the databases at X-Force ([44788](?source_xforce.3807 "Xforce")), Tenable ([10320](?source_nessus_id.3807 "Nessus")), SecurityFocus (BID 30919†), OSVDB (47879†) and Secunia (SA31650†).

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
