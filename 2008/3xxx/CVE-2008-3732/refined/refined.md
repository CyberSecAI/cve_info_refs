  "CVE-2008-3732": {
    "Description": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the tta.c module of VLC Media Player version 0.8.6i, which can be triggered by opening a specially crafted .tta file. This is caused by an integer overflow when calculating the size of the seek table. The i_datalength variable, read from the header of the TTA file, can be set to a large value, such as 2^30, while the i_rate is set to 1, resulting in an overflow when calculating i_seektable_size, due to the multiplication of `sizeof(uint32_t)` by the large `i_totalframes`, which is equal to `i_datalength`. Subsequently, when the code iterates through the loop using the oversized `i_totalframes`, it overwrites heap memory, leading to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow when calculating the size of the seek table in the tta.c module, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "Attack vectors": "Opening a specially crafted .tta file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create a specially crafted .tta file and entice a user to open it."
