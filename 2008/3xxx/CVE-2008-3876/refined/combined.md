Wrong. It doesn't exist on the iPod touch because there is NO EMERGENCY CALL button first. You can't double tap until you get into the Emergency Call area

Thanks for your non-insulting post. I appreciate it : )

For one thing though, the entire iphone software design is in an attempt to be simple and idiot proof. They think out ever user error they can think of to try and prevent it from the software side in attempts to make this the best phone/device on the planet. To do what I'm saying would be soooo simple in comparrison to other software fixes that they have to come up with and is so minor. I mean, the apple laptops actually have a hard-drive that protects itself when its dropped. Apple did that for user hard drive protection incase of accidents. This is on a much smaller scale don't you think?

Plus, its not just user error. Its apples hardware error. According to apple (I asked them believe me), if the hardware in the iphone goes out like a censor or something for some random reason (like a stick of ram or hard drive in a pc), then what do they do? Its the hardwares fault, not the user.... but apple would just replace the entire phone and the data would be lost (unless you paid $$$ to a data recovery place).

If they flip-floped things so that you enter the password on the computer when syncing instead of the phone then the problem would be solved. The apple techs I spoke with completely agreed with me and didn't know why it wasn't setup that way in the first place...

Apples and oranges. This ain't a scriptable exploit. It's not like MR-perusing evil personae are going on an iPhone theft rampage now that they know they can hack into some.

Just set your home button to something else if you happen to have pointed it to them favorites.

Yeah, sorry - you are correct. However, there isn't an option to change what the double tap of the home button does in the iPod (not that this is relevant to this discussion now, but I thought it was interesting nonetheless)

Not sure why yours wouldn't (maybe something to do with the water damage, maybe you were trying to sync to a different computer?) but I have my iPhone (v1 but latest firmware) set to autolock the screen after 1 minute, password protected, and every time I plug it into my mac it syncs (including offloading photos) without me having to type the passcode to unlock the screen first. I plug it in, the "Sync in progress" screen comes on, it syncs. That's the way it's always worked.

If you do forget the passcode you can reset it by doing a restore in iTunes and regain access to the phone (this is documented in the users guide). That wipes the data, of course, but as I said you should be able to sync to the computer your phone is paired with without the code.

**Safari access means you can access other apps**

I have 2.02 and Exchange set up and the instructions worked perfectly. After I got to a contact with a URL and opened Safari, I was able to go to the PapiJump scores page and load and play PapiJump while the phone was still locked.

Apparently with the right window.location() javascript (which you could load from your own website once you have Safari), you can navigate to any app. I haven't tried, but you may be able to open the App Store and install your own app on the phone all while the phone is locked.

The problem here is that the barrier-to-entry is so low. You leave your phone unattended for 30 seconds and someone can get your home phone number, your last 5 recent calls, and read your latest corporate email. Then they set the phone back down and you'll never know.

The problem is what if you have an email with sensitive info like credit card number, pin number, etc.... and now that person who looked at your phone for 30 seconds has all that info and you don't know!

No one is making you jailbreak.

No one would make you install BossPrefs even if you did jailbreak.

No one would make you set BossPrefs to open when you double click the home button even if you did install BossPrefs.

No need to throw unsolicited criticism my way. I was merely posting more info about the bug.

If someone were to say "I'll add this to my list of reason not to buy an iPhone" wouldn't that be upsetting? ![;)](data:image/gif;base64... "Wink    ;)")

Or leave their phone unattended, which was the point I was trying to make in the first post.

What if someone steals.... goes to all the bank websites and clicks forgot password email it to me or for that fact any website with login info and clicks forgot password and since they have access to your email they will have access to website passwords!

And I'm not upset that you posted it first, greenmymac, or that it's being publicized all over the internet-- TUAW, Gizmodo, etc. What bothers me a little is that you're taking credit for the discovery. Not only that, you've plagiarized my own submission basically word-for-word.

Allow me to explain:

I figured this out a couple nights ago, and called Apple about it to point it out and see if there was a temporary fix (they suggested setting the home button to iPod controls). I also filed a bug report via Apple's Developer Bug Reporter (I'm signed up as a free iPhone developer). A few hours later, I sent that bug report in full to both MacRumors (via the news submission form) and TUAW (using their Tips page). The first post in this page is, word for word, a portion of that bug report. If it really comes to that, I can submit screenshots/Apple problem ID numbers/my follow-up email from Apple (with times BEFORE this thread's first post), etc. as proof, but I hope this won't be necessary. I'm not looking to start a flame war here, just don't like it when someone plagiarizes me so transparently. Greenmymac: I'm not sure if you got ahold of this via MacRumors, TUAW, or (god forbid) Apple, but was it REALLY necessary to claim the discovery as your own?

According to the ADC email I received, this was already a known issue. Nevertheless, I AM happy about how much attention this has gotten, hopefully that will spur Apple into putting out a fix sooner rather than later. I actually submitted it anonymously in the first place, so I wasn't exactly looking for credit. But it doesn't feel right to let greenmymac post this as if it were HIS (or her) discovery, uncontested.

If you bank with a website that will email you your password with the click of a button without asking for other authentication info, you deserve it.

He's my friend, and honestly, if I were him, I'd be livid. Even if you're from TUAW or MacRumors, or hell, even Apple, you had no right to take all the credit for this. He was the first person to find it, and he should have the credit. I have even more proof.

HE discovered this, and HE should have the credit, not GreenyMac.

Pics or it didn't happen ![:rolleyes:](data:image/gif;base64... "Roll Eyes    :rolleyes:")

You are making a pretty bold claim for somebody who isn't all that active here as a member (only one post), and doesn't have any real connection between your reports and this thread.

Which wasn't there when I typed that, and even still there is no proof that you are talking with him, and I would hardly call that proof. And it still doesn't show how this thread's OP got the info.

Uh, because if GreenyMac was my friend who sent me that, I'd be calling him out, right? Or wait, that might be stupid!

If you're hard pressed to believe me even still:

![20080828-jifqcy69ypt71gfj6yty8wbfkg.png](/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.skitch.com%2F20080828-jifqcy69ypt71gfj6yty8wbfkg.png&hash=b3e09dca8e09dc612bd6e7a7abb798aa)

Unless GreenyMac decided to have an extremely similar username on iChat and I'm friends with him this is more proof than needed.

How is that proof? So I guess what your saying is I hacked into your computer and watched you and your iChat conversation?

No, it's proof that he found it before you did, and he's currently taking sreenshots proving that it's WORD FOR WORD.

**Admin Edit**: User *hdm42* appears to be the [original source](https://forums.macrumors.com/posts/6121914/) for this flaw discovery.

-----------------

2.0.2 gives almost full access to the iPhone even while under password protection...

Steps to Reproduce

Set iPhone to use passcode lock, have contacts marked as Favorites with links, phone numbers, addresses, etc in address book entry.

Tap "Emergency Call" keypad from passcode entry screen.

Double-tap home button.

Tap blue arrow next to contact's name. You now have full access to applications such as Safari, complete Contacts list, SMS, Maps, "full" Phone access, and Mail by accessing various entries on the Favorite's page, i.e. tapping their home page brings up a full, unrestricted Safari.

I refuse to move to 2.02 so I cannot try, but holy \*\*\*\*! I tried it on 2.01 and guess what? It works the same way!

How in the world did you find this? And it is a huge flaw. Did you report it to Apple? I think I'm going to (or at least toss it on Digg so people know), it may be all in vain, but at least it's a start.

You probably have the home button set to iPod.

I just tried it and it works with the iPod setting.

Good thing that if you set double tap to Home that it simply brings you back to the passcode screen.

So it only works if you have it set to Favorites or iPod.

That should only happen when you are listening to music, unless you have set the double-tap shortcut to be the iPod rather than favorites. If anyone is truly concerned about this all you should have to do is change that shortcut. Is it really worth the trouble? If someone steals your iPhone they aren't going to give it back when they find out that they can't make this security breach.

edit: And tree'd.

Dude that is some crazy stuff. You sir, are one crazy hacker. I've never heard of this before on any site. This needs to be sent out to Giz, Engadget, Digg, everyone.

The fix FTW: disable double tapping of home button in Settings > General > Home Button > Checkmark Home and it will kick it back out of the emergency call screen when they double tap. If you don't care about someone listening to your iTunes library, then just select iPod instead or you can leave this setting alone if it's already set, which it was on my iPhone originally.

By default it goes to favorites, at least with my 3G it does...However it does go to the iPod by default if you have it set to do so while playing music.

Wow, just tried this on my iPhone and can't believe that it actually works. Can't get into Safari since none of my favorite contacts have any webpages associated with them, but it's still scary that anyone would be able to call, email or text message my closest friends and family without having any clue as to what my passcode is.

Holy crap! I too just tried this and replicated it just as you said. This is crazy! Apple needs to fix this and fast. I too am going to send a report to Apple regarding this. Very nice catch!

Wow, sounds like someone at Apple is about to be yelled at or get fired...

Nothing is perfect, but this is quite unacceptable.

It's not a major problem for me since I don't really use that feature, but I'm sure that shows the unreliability the iPhone has especially for high-level agents that need to secure their information.
