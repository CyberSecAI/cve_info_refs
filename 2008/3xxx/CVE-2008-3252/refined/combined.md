| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=454483#c0)  Enrico Scholz    2008-07-08 18:59:34 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Runnings newsx to fetch <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.mail.spam.spamassassin.general/109986> generates an  | *** stack smashing detected ***: newsx(news.gmane.org) gmane.mail.spam.spamassassin.general 109996 terminated  abort. This is caused by  --- src/getarticle.c --- static int read_article(long where,char *group) {     char linebuf[MAX_HEADER_SIZE+1], *line;     ...     line=linebuf;     ...     for (;;) {         if (!get_server_msg(line, MAX_HEADER_SIZE)) { 	...                 if (line[1]=='.') {             /* escape-period, remove it */                     line++;                     len--;  	 -------------   i.e. 'line' grows and grows when a line starts with '.'.  Having hundreds of such lines make 'linebuf[]' overflow and it is possible to place arbitrary data on stack.   Fix would be probably  | -        if (!get_server_msg(line, MAX_HEADER_SIZE)) { | +        if (!get_server_msg(linebuf, MAX_HEADER_SIZE)) {  but is untested.   Stack-smash detection protects against remote code execution. Nevertheless, it causes lot of traffic (newsx fetches articles but aborts before updating 'active' file)    Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  newsx-1.6-8.fc9.x86_64   How reproducible:  100%   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=454483#c1)  Enrico Scholz    2008-07-08 19:06:26 UTC  ``` mmh... it's too late and no coffee...  Proposed fix won't work; instead of the  | line=linebuf  must be moved into the loop.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=454483#c2)  Dominik 'Rathann' Mierzejewski    2008-07-12 16:00:25 UTC  ``` I believe your analysis is incorrect. line pointer gets reset in          if (!get_server_msg(line, MAX_HEADER_SIZE)) {             /* timeout: simply give up */             return 0;         }  I'll try to reproduce the crash and see what I can do about it.    ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=454483#c3)  Dominik 'Rathann' Mierzejewski    2008-07-12 18:54:45 UTC  ``` ... or it actually doesn't get reset. After running it through gdb I can see that what you described is actually happening. I'll have a fixed build after I've tested the fix.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=454483#c4)  Dominik 'Rathann' Mierzejewski    2008-07-12 20:59:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 311653](attachment.cgi?id=311653&action=diff "patch to fix the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=311653&action=edit "patch to fix the issue") patch to fix the issue  Attached patch fixes the issue. Updated build will be available shortly.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=454483#c5)  Dominik 'Rathann' Mierzejewski    2008-07-12 21:10:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 311654](attachment.cgi?id=311654&action=diff "patch to fix the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=311654&action=edit "patch to fix the issue") patch to fix the issue  Obviously the previous patch is wrong.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

Package        : newsx
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-3252
Debian Bug     : 492742

It was discovered that newsx, an NNTP news exchange utility, was affected
by a buffer overflow allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via a news article containing a large number of lines starting with a period.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.6-2etch1.

For the testing (lenny) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem has
been fixed in version 1.6-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your newsx package.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
