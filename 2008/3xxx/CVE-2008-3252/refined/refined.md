      "source": "bugzilla.redhat.com_ee39f242_20250125_042626.html",
      "root_cause": "The `read_article` function in `getarticle.c` within `newsx` does not properly handle lines starting with a period, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow"
      ],
       "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted news article containing a large number of lines starting with a period. Stack-smash detection can also cause the program to abort, impacting availability as newsx fetches articles but aborts before updating the 'active' file",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A specially crafted news article with a large number of lines starting with a period."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send the malicious news article to a vulnerable `newsx` server."
