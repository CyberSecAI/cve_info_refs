    "cve": "CVE-2008-3533",
    "content": "The provided documents discuss a format string vulnerability in the yelp help browser application. \n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the improper use of `gtk_message_dialog_format_secondary_markup()` in `yelp-window.c`. Specifically, an error message containing a user-provided URI is passed to this function without a format string, allowing format string specifiers within the URI to be interpreted as format specifiers by the function.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Format string vulnerability:** The primary weakness is that `gtk_message_dialog_format_secondary_markup` is called without a proper format string, directly using the URI which is passed by user, thus leading to format string vulnerability.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary code execution:** By providing a specially crafted URI, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Malicious URI:** The primary attack vector is through the use of a malicious URI. This URI can be passed to yelp through various means, including:\n  - **Manual invocation:** Directly invoking `yelp` from the command line with a crafted URI.\n  - **User-assisted remote exploitation:** Using a web browser like Firefox or an email client such as Evolution via  `man` or `ghelp` URIs registered to launch yelp with the malicious URI. Although Evolution prompts the user for confirmation, Firefox 3.0 does not preview the arguments being passed, potentially leading to unsuspecting users being exploited.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Crafted URI:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URI with format string specifiers.\n- **User interaction (potentially):** Some attack vectors may require some minimal user interaction, such as clicking on a malicious link. In the case of direct command line usage, the user is explicitly executing the command.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability was introduced by a code cleanup that removed the proper use of a format string.\n- Affected versions are all versions of `yelp` newer than 2.19.90.\n- Patches were created to correct the usage of `gtk_message_dialog_format_secondary_markup`, by adding the format string specifier, and address the vulnerability. \n- This vulnerability can be exploited through various programs that use yelp through URI handlers, and can lead to remote exploitation through minimal user assistance.\n- Patched versions of `yelp` were released to fix the format string vulnerability"
