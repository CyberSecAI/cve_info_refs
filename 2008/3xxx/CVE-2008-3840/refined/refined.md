Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3840:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `is_xmlhttp.php` and `is_flush.php` files of Crafty Syntax Live Help.
- The code directly uses an untrusted `department` parameter from the URL in an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `department` parameter, manipulating the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Database Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary database content, potentially including sensitive information such as:
    - User credentials (usernames and passwords).
    - Administrator credentials.
    - Other sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Administrative Access:** Since the application appears to store passwords in plain text, an attacker can gain administrative access to the system after obtaining the credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `is_xmlhttp.php` (or `is_flush.php`) file.
- **Manipulated 'department' Parameter:** The `department` parameter in the URL is manipulated to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious injection.
- The content mentions that the issue is present regardless of magic quotes settings.

**More Details than CVE description:**
- The content provides more details than a basic CVE description, including:
    - The specific vulnerable files (`is_xmlhttp.php`, `is_flush.php`).
    - The vulnerable code snippet.
    - The specific parameter (`department`) used for exploitation.
    - An example URL for exploitation.
    - The potential for gaining administrative access.
    - The fact that passwords are stored in plaintext
    - The vendor's website and advisory link.
