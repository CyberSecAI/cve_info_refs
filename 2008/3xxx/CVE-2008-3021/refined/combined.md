## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on August 13, 2008?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to clarify that the update for Microsoft Office Project 2002 Service Pack 1 is the same as the update for Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 3 in the Affected Software table. Because the update is the same, Project 2002 does not have a separate subsection in the section, **Security Update Deployment**. This is a bulletin change only. Customers who have already successfully installed this update do not have to reinstall.

**I do not have all of the affected software installed, but I do have other Microsoft Office applications installed. Why am I being offered the security update?**

The vulnerabilities described in this security update exist within Microsoft Office but could not be exploited using one of the applications listed in the Non-Affected Software table. The Microsoft Office applications listed in the Non-Affected Software table use some of the same files as the applications listed in the Affected Software table to which the security update applies. We recommend installing the update to prevent the security update from being offered again.

**I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2. Are any additional security features included in this update?**

Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2003, when users of Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. All updates released after January 1, 2008 for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 will include these security features, which were introduced in [Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=e25b7049-3e13-433b-b9d2-5e3c1132f206). We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951646](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/951646).

**Where are the file information details?**

The file information details can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 924090](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/924090).

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

For more information about the extended security update support period for these software versions or editions, visit [Microsoft Product Support Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).

Customers who require custom support for older releases must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

**I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. Why am I still being offered this update?**

Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 is not impacted by the security vulnerabilities documented in this bulletin. However, users will still be offered this update because the files included with the update have a higher version number than the files that are currently on your system.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**What is included in the Microsoft Office update that causes the higher version of the update files?**

The update files include changes to support stability changes in Microsoft Office and additional changes to support corporate environment changes. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to their environment and configurations of their systems.

## Microsoft Malformed EPS Filter Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3019

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that a Microsoft Office filter handles a malformed graphics image. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file that could allow remote code execution if a user opened the file with a Microsoft Office application. Such a specially crafted file might be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a malicious or compromised Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, significant user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-3019](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3019).

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Malformed EPS Filter Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3019

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file containing a specially crafted EPS image that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince the user to open the file in an affected Microsoft Office application.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file. Additionally, when Microsoft Word is being used as the HTML e-mail editor in Outlook, a user would need to reply to or forward a malicious e-mail message in order for this vulnerability to be exploited.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and Office 2003.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Malformed EPS Filter Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3019

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Modify the Access Control List to deny access to EPSIMP32.FLT for all users**

  **Registry Method**

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Malformed EPS Filter Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3019

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office and could be exploited when a user opens a file containing a malformed graphics image or when a user inserts a malformed graphics image into an Office file. Such a file might also be included in an e-mail attachment. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted EPS file that could allow remote code execution.

If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Microsoft Office opens a specially crafted EPS image file, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince the user to open the file in a Microsoft Office application.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file. Additionally, when Microsoft Word is being used as the HTML e-mail editor in Outlook, a user would need to reply to or forward a malicious e-mail message sent to them in order for this vulnerability to be exploited.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers that have Microsoft Office installed are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

This update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Office parses the length of an EPS file before passing the file to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file. Additionally, when Microsoft Word is being used as the HTML e-mail editor in Outlook, a user would need to reply to or forward a malicious e-mail message sent to them in order for this vulnerability to be exploited.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers that have Microsoft Office installed are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

This update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Office parses the length of a PICT-format image file before it passes the file to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft PICT Filter Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3021

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file containing a specially crafted PICT image that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince the user to open the file in an affected Microsoft Office application.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file. Additionally, when Microsoft Word is being used as the HTML e-mail editor in Outlook, a user would need to reply to or forward a malicious e-mail message in order for this vulnerability to be exploited.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document.

### Update Information

## Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance

Manage the software and security updates you need to deploy to the servers, desktop, and mobile systems in your organization. For more information see the [TechNet Update Management Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=69903). The [Microsoft TechNet Security Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21132) provides additional information about security in Microsoft products.

Security updates are available from [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747), [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130), and [Office Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21135). Security updates are also available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21129). You can find them most easily by doing a keyword search for "security update."

Finally, security updates can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=96155). The Microsoft Update Catalog provides a searchable catalog of content made available through Windows Update and Microsoft Update, including security updates, drivers and service packs. By searching using the security bulletin number (such as, âMS07-036â), you can add all of the applicable updates to your basket (including different languages for an update), and download to the folder of your choosing. For more information about the Microsoft Update Catalog, see the [Microsoft Update Catalog FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=97900).

**Detection and Deployment Guidance**

Microsoft has provided detection and deployment guidance for this monthâs security updates. This guidance will also help IT professionals understand how they can use various tools to help deploy the security update, such as Windows Update, Microsoft Update, Office Update, the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), the Office Detection Tool, Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS), and the Extended Security Update Inventory Tool. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/910723).

**Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates as well as common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsahome.mspx).

The following table provides the MBSA detection summary for this security update.

| Software | MBSA 2.1 |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Office 2000 Service Pack 3 | No |
| Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 3 | Yes |
| Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 | Yes |
| Microsoft Office Converter Pack | Yes |
| Microsoft Works 8 | Yes\* |

\***Note** If the system uses Microsoft Update for update scanning and can access Microsoft Update (which a scan report can determine), MBSA 2.1 will detect Microsoft Works 8. However, if the system is managed by WSUS or is in an offline secure environment, which forces the system to use the WSUSSCN2.CAB offline catalog, MBSA 2.1 will not detect Microsoft Works 8.

For more information about MBSA 2.1, see [MBSA 2.1 Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsa2/qa.mspx).

**Note** For customers using legacy software not supported by MBSA 2.1, Microsoft Update, and Windows Server Update Services: please visit [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsahome.mspx) and reference the Legacy Product Support section on how to create comprehensive security update detection with legacy tools.

For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Removing the Update**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office 2003 CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the âMicrosoft Baseline Security Analyzerâ heading under the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance,** earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
