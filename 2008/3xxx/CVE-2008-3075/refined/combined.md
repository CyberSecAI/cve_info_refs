Subject: vim: multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2008-3074, CVE-2008-3075,

Package: vim
Version: 1:7.0.109
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

redhat has just released an update that fixes multiple security flaws in
vim [1].  these issues are currently reserved in the CVE tracker, but
redhat describes the probems as:

  Multiple security flaws were found in netrw.vim, the Vim plug-in providing
  file reading and writing over the network. If a user opened a specially
  crafted file or directory with the netrw plug-in, it could result in
  arbitrary code execution as the user running Vim. ([CVE-2008-3076](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3076))

  A security flaw was found in zip.vim, the Vim plug-in that handles ZIP
  archive browsing. If a user opened a ZIP archive using the zip.vim plug-in,
  it could result in arbitrary code execution as the user running Vim.
  ([CVE-2008-3075](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3075))

  A security flaw was found in tar.vim, the Vim plug-in which handles TAR
  archive browsing. If a user opened a TAR archive using the tar.vim plug-in,
  it could result in arbitrary code execution as the user runnin Vim.
  ([CVE-2008-3074](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3074))

versions affected are unclear from the redhat notice, but the problem at
least applies to vim version 7.0.109, which they have fixed in rhel5.

thanks for working to keep debian secure.

These are basically split out versions of previously released
vulnerabilities.  They're fixed in the above mentioned versions.

Subject: Re: Re: More arbitrary code executions in Netrw
 version 125, Vim 7.2a.10

All,

My head and shoulders genuinely hurt from trying to figure this out.
Sorry for the delay.

I don't think explaining how CVEs work will help in this extremely complex
situation.

I have a number of questions, some of which are based on the newest
advisories that rdancer released...

************************************************************************
************************************************************************
This section is about issues that don't seem to have any major
confusion.  Please confirm.
************************************************************************
************************************************************************

------------------------------------------------------------
filetype.vim not fixed

 - inconsistent regular expression usage in substitute()
   <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-filetype.vim.updated.html>

 - earlier filetype.vim issue was in CVE-2008-2712.1

 - NEEDS NEW CVE

------------------------------------------------------------
heap overflow, demonstrated by netrw.v3

    - NEW CVE assigned: CVE-2008-3432

      - vim 6.2 and 6.3 (mch_expand_wildcards)

      - <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/4>

------------------------------------------------------------
configure.in temp file issue

  - ALREADY assigned CVE: CVE-2008-3294 (see web site)

    - vim 5.0 through 7.1, maybe earlier, fixed in 7.2b.014

    - <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-configure.in.html>

------------------------------------------------------------
netrw.v5 test case

  - NEEDS NEW CVE

  - <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v5.html>

  - affected version: Netrw version 127, Vim 7.2b

  - affected file: netrw.vim

************************************************************************
************************************************************************
This section is for remaining issues that need clarification.
************************************************************************
************************************************************************

------------------------------------------------------------
shellescape() implementation issue (tar):

  - Report TAR-1

    rdancer says "shellescape() does not escape all special items"
    specifically the "!" character

    - <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-shellescape.html>

    - 7.2a.013 and other versions before 7.2b.005

    - mentions tar.vim (tarplugin)

    - test case: tarplugin.v2

  - Report TAR-2

     Tomas Hoger says affects 7.0 and 7.1:

     <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/2>

  - Report TAR-3

     assignment of CVE-2008-3074 to "tarplugin"

	 <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/10/7>

	 - already used by rPath in advisory

  - Report TAR-4

     rdancer tar.vim issue

	   <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html>

  - Report TAR-5

    rdancer says tar.vim test was omitted from Makefile

	<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/13/1>

1) Are TAR-1, TAR-2, TAR-3, and TAR-4 all talking about the same
   issue?  If not - which ones are the same?

2) Since tar.vim doesn't affect 6.x, it should stay SPLIT from
   CVE-2008-2712.

------------------------------------------------------------
zip.vim

  - Report ZIP-1

    rdancer says "zip.vim" as well as "zipPlugin.vim"

    - <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html>

	- Vim 7.1.298 and 6.4

	- *part* of the advisory used CVE-2008-2712, but CVE-2008-2712
       didn't include it

  - Report ZIP-2

    Tomas Hoger suggests "still unfixed"

	   <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/10/7>

    - CVE-2008-3075 assigned; used by rPath

	- since CVE-2008-2712 issues were fixed and zip.vim remains
      unfixed, a SPLIT from CVE-2008-2712 is reasonable

  - Report ZIP-3

    Tomas Hoger says "only 7.0 and 7.1" affected

	  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/2>

  - Report ZIP-4

    rdancer says zip "has not been fixed as of Vim 7.2a.19/zip.vim
    v19"

	  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/13/1>

  - Report ZIP-5

    CVE-2008-2712 bullet (2) mentions zipplugin based on same advisory
    as ZIP-1:

	<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2712>

1) Are ZIP-1, ZIP-2, ZIP-3, and ZIP-4 all talking about the same
   issue?

2) What differences, if any, are there in zip.vim and zipplugin.vim?

3) Given the varying results for TAR-1 through TAR-4, should zip.vim
   be split from the tar issues?  What about zipplugin.vim?

4) It might be reasonable to remove item (2) from CVE-2008-2712.

------------------------------------------------------------
Looking at netrw.v2:

  - Report NETRW2-a

    rdancer says "mx" and "mz" in:
    <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.html>

	NO version information provided in this advisory, but title
	indicates "Netrw version 125, Vim 7.2a.10"

  - Report NETRW2-b

    Tomas Hoger mentions "mz and mc" in:
    <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/4>

	but: mc is probably referring to netrw.v3, so not relevant here

	mz "should only affect 7.2 alpha"

  - Report NETRW2-c

  - rdancer says "mf" (section 3.1) and "mz" (section 3.2) in:
    <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v2.html>

	but then, rdancer also gives an example for "mx" (3.2.1)

	versions: 7.2a.10, Netrw version 125.

1) What role, if any, does "mf" play (NETRW2-c)?  It's listed as a
   "prerequisite" then nothing else is said.  Does it have a
   vulnerability?  Or does the victim need to mark a file before
   decompressing it?

2) "mx" doesn't use quoting in section 3.2.1 (NETRW2-a), so does it
   have a vulnerability too?

3) Which combination of mx, mz, and mf is really being covered by
   the netrw.v2 test case?

------------------------------------------------------------
Looking at netrw.v3:

  - Report NETRW3-a

    rdancer says "mc" shellescape issues in:
    <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.html>

	- missing use of shellescape for "args" variable in mc command

  - Report NETRW3-b

    Tomas Hoger mentions "mz and mc" in:
    <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/4>

	but: mz is probably referring to netrw.v2, so not relevant here

	- mc "should only affect 7.2 alpha"

  - Report NETRW3-c

    Tomas Hoger says heap overflow (not mentioned in rdancer)
    <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/4>

  - Report NETRW3-d

    rdancer says netrw.v3 is "vulnerable" in an advisory about
    netrw.v5:

	   <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v5.html>

    version: Vim 7.2b

1) NETRW3-c is clearly different, so CVE-2008-3432 is assigned.

2) Are NETRW3-a and NETRW3-b talking about the same issue?

3) What is the relationship between NETRW3-b and NETRW3-d?  The
   version numbers conflict.

4) Because of item 3, I'm tempted to split netrw.v3.

5) In NETRW3-a, rdancer says there are "many places" but only
   emphasizes the "args" part

   a) why does the patch only address one issue?

   b) the other quoted examples seem to use shellescape().  Are these
   vulnerable too?

------------------------------------------------------------
Looking at netrw.v4:

  - Report NETRW4-a

    shellescape issues in the "D" command for deleting files
    <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.html>

	NO version information provided in this advisory, but title
	indicates "Netrw version 125, Vim 7.2a.10"

  - Report NETRW4-b

    Tomas Hoger says netrw.v4 affects 7.0 and 7.1
	<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/4>

    - DOES NOT affect explorer.vim in 6.x

1) Why does NETRW4-a mention "function s:NetrwLocalRmFile()" twice?

2) Why does NETRW4-a point to lots of examples where "shellescape" is
   used?

3) Is appears that NETRW4-b remains unfixed according to NETRW4-a, is
   that right?

------------------------------------------------------------
Looking at netrw explorer.vim plugin:

  - Report EXP-1

    "netrw" test case triggers "similar problem" in explorer.vim:

	<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/2>

	- in vim 6.x

  - Report EXP-2

    "netrw.v4" test case does not affect explorer.vim

1) Does this need a separate ID?  If not, which does it belong with?

```

# CVE-2008-3075

| **Name** | CVE-2008-3075 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The shellescape function in Vim 7.0 through 7.2, including 7.2a.10, allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via the "!" (exclamation point) shell metacharacter in (1) the filename of a ZIP archive and possibly (2) the filename of the first file in a ZIP archive, which is not properly handled by zip.vim in the VIM ZIP plugin (zipPlugin.vim) v.11 through v.21, as demonstrated by the zipplugin and zipplugin.v2 test cases. NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2712. NOTE: this issue has the same root cause as CVE-2008-3074. NOTE: due to the complexity of the associated disclosures and the incomplete information related to them, there may be inaccuracies in this CVE description and in external mappings to this identifier. |

Subject: Vim CVE issues cleanup (plugins tar.vim, zip.vim) - CVE-2008-3074
 and CVE-2008-3075

Hello Steve and Jan,

  got time to dive deeply into these issues and attempting to
summarize all the information about them known till today,
in order to clear specification of CVE-2008-3074 and CVE-2008-3075
to be able to reference them in our advisories.

Tar.vim plugin issues:

Original advisory:  <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-shellescape.html>

Part 1 -- TAR Observations:
===========================

* Jan Minar says: Version  : >= 7.2a.013; < 7.2b.005; tested with 7.2b
                            The shellescape() function added by patch 7.0.111.
* Patch 7.0.111: [http://www.mail-archive.com/vim-dev@vim.org/msg02313.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/vim-dev%40vim.org/msg02313.html)

* Vulnerability (from vulnerablevim-shellescape.html)

   3. Vulnerability

   shellescape() does not escape all special items.  In particular,
   shellescape() does not escape the ``!'' character.

   4. Exploit -- Proof of Concept

  To show that this vulnerability can be exploited, we have updated our
  ``tar.vim'' exploit.   Run ``make test'' in the ``tarplugin.v2''
  directory.

* Testcases for this issue (from Vim testsuite) (self research):

  -- shellescape (from Makefile - rdancer's exploit of the Vim 7.2b shellescape vuln)
  -- tarplugin.v2 (from Makefile - rdancer's exploit of the Vim shellescape() vuln)
  -- tarplugin (from Makefile -- rdancer's exploit of the vim 7.1 tar plugin)
  -- tarplugin.updated (from Makefile - rdancer's exploit of the vim 7.1 tar plugin)

   Differences between Makefiles in particular testcases:

   tarplugin vs tarplugin.v2:

    24c22
    < TARBALL_NAME = "sploit/$(INITIAL)'|so%|retu|'$(FINAL).tar"
    ---
    > TARBALL_NAME = "sploit/$(INITIAL);eval eval \`echo 0:64617465203e2070776e6564 | xxd -r\`;: $(FINAL).tar"

    and Vim debug options added:

    40a39,42
    > # For the test target -- Non-interactive run
    > VIM_TEST_OPTIONS = ${VIM_OPTIONS} +:'exe "norm \<CR>"' +:qa
    > # For the debug target -- Add breakpoints
    > VIM_DEBUG_OPTIONS = +':breakadd func 38 tar\#Read' ${VIM_TEST_OPTIONS}
    62a65,69

    tarplugin vs tarplugin.updated:

    c24
    < TARBALL_NAME = "sploit/$(INITIAL)'|so%|retu|'$(FINAL).tar"
    ---
    > TARBALL_NAME = "sploit/$(INITIAL)%;eval eval \`echo 0:64617465203e2070776e6564 | xxd -r\`;'$(FINAL).tar"

* Your questions in  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/08/01/1> :

    Report TAR-1

    rdancer says "shellescape() does not escape all special items"
    specifically the "!" character

    - <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-shellescape.html>

    - 7.2a.013 and other versions before 7.2b.005

    - mentions tar.vim (tarplugin)

    - test case: tarplugin.v2

  - Report TAR-2

     Tomas Hoger says affects 7.0 and 7.1:

     <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/2>

  - Report TAR-3

     assignment of CVE-2008-3074 to "tarplugin"

         <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/10/7>

         - already used by rPath in advisory

  - Report TAR-4

     rdancer tar.vim issue

           <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html>

  - Report TAR-5

    rdancer says tar.vim test was omitted from Makefile

        <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/13/1>

   1) Are TAR-1, TAR-2, TAR-3, and TAR-4 all talking about the same
      issue?  If not - which ones are the same?

   2) Since tar.vim doesn't affect 6.x, it should stay SPLIT from
      CVE-2008-2712.

* Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.0, tar.vim v.10 (from Jul 24,2006) <= x < Vim 7.2, tar.vim v.23 (from Aug 08, 2008)
                         Vim 6.0 DOES NOT include tar.vim plugin.
                         (based on self testing)

Part 2 -- TAR Conclusions:
==========================

  The testcase to find out if Vim is vulnerable to the
  shellescape vulnerability is in 'shellescape'. The proof
  this issue can be exploited is in 'tarplugin.v2'. (Report TAR-1)
  Rdancer has originally claimed, this issue affects only Vim
  (>= 7.2a.013; < 7.2b.005;), But 'tarplugin.v2' testcase
  run proofs it affects also Vim 7.0 and Vim 7.1. (Report TAR-2)
  We should probably use CVE-2008-3074 when referencing to
  these issues (Report TAR-3).
  Report TAR-4 issue is covered by 'tarplugin' testcase
  (the same issue).
  Report TAR-5 - only top-most Makefile change.

Replies to your questions: 1, TAR-1, TAR-2, TAR-3 and TAR-4 are talking about the same issue.
                              The 'only' slight difference between them is the provided
                              "TARBALL_NAME" to the testcase.

                           2, This issue should be definitely split from CVE-2008-2712 -- reasons:
                              a, it does not affect Vim 6.0,
                              b, CVE-2008-2712 has no mention about tar.vim plugin
                              c, we should use already assigned CVE-2008-3074 for this
                                 issue (as it was already used in the rPath advisory).
                              d, See also part "Proposed description for CVE-2008-3074".

Part 3 -- ZIP Observations:
===========================

* Original advisory: <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html> (Part 3.4.2.4. zip.vim)
* Testcases: zipplugin
             zipplugin.v2

  Difference between Makefiles:

    a, different name used for the zip archive

    24c24,25
    < ARCHIVE_NAME = "sploit/$(INITIAL)'|so%|retu|'$(FINAL).zip"
    ---
    > ARCHIVE_NAME = "sploit/$(INITIAL)|call system(\"eval eval \`echo 0:64617465203e3e2070776e6564 | xxd -r\`\")|$(FINAL).zip"

    b, Different "# Compile the exploit\n# The ar\n.PHONY: sploit\nsploit: exploit.vim plugin" part

* Relation between zip.vim and zipPlugin.vim (zipplugin mentioned in bullet (2) of CVE-2008-2172)

  /usr/share/vim/vim71/plugin/zipPlugin.vim "only" calls zip functions (zipBrowse, zipRead, zipWrite etc.)
  defined in /usr/share/vim/vim71/autoload/zip.vim

* Your questions in <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/08/01/1> related to ZIP plugin:

  zip.vim

  - Report ZIP-1

    rdancer says "zip.vim" as well as "zipPlugin.vim"

    - <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html>

	- Vim 7.1.298 and 6.4

	- *part* of the advisory used CVE-2008-2712, but CVE-2008-2712
       didn't include it

  - Report ZIP-2

    Tomas Hoger suggests "still unfixed"

	   <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/10/7>

    - CVE-2008-3075 assigned; used by rPath

	- since CVE-2008-2712 issues were fixed and zip.vim remains
      unfixed, a SPLIT from CVE-2008-2712 is reasonable

  - Report ZIP-3

    Tomas Hoger says "only 7.0 and 7.1" affected

	  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/2>

  - Report ZIP-4

    rdancer says zip "has not been fixed as of Vim 7.2a.19/zip.vim
    v19"

	  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/13/1>

  - Report ZIP-5

    CVE-2008-2712 bullet (2) mentions zipplugin based on same advisory
    as ZIP-1:

	<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2712>

    1) Are ZIP-1, ZIP-2, ZIP-3, and ZIP-4 all talking about the same
       issue?

    2) What differences, if any, are there in zip.vim and zipplugin.vim?

    3) Given the varying results for TAR-1 through TAR-4, should zip.vim
       be split from the tar issues?  What about zipplugin.vim?

    4) It might be reasonable to remove item (2) from CVE-2008-2712.

* Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.0, zip.vim v.11 (from Jul 24, 2006) < Vim 7.2, zip.vim v.22 (Jul 30, 2008)
                         Vim 6.0+ DOES NOT include zip.vim plugin.

Part 4 -- ZIP Conclusions:
==========================

  zipPlugin.vim was mentioned in CVE-2008-2712, but zip.vim omitted. zipPlugin.vim
  "only" calls functions (zipWrite, zipRead, zipBrowse) provided by the zip.vim
  plugin. The text of CVE-2008-2712 should be modified -- the bullet (2) -- mention
  about zipplugin should be removed from it, as the issue was fixed only later
  in zip.vim plugin (Report ZIP-1).

  CVE-2008-3075 was used by rPath for this issue (Report ZIP-2).

  According to zipplugin testcases (zipplugin, zipplugin.v2) also Vim 7.0, and
  Vim 7.1 affected by this issue (Report ZIP-3).

  zip.vim v.19 is still vulnerable to this issue. Fixed in version zip.vim v.22
  (see Affected Vim versions). (Report ZIP-4).

  Bullet (2) -- mention about zipplugin should be removed from CVE-2008-2712.
  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2712> (Report ZIP-5).

* Replies to your questions:

    1) Are ZIP-1, ZIP-2, ZIP-3, and ZIP-4 all talking about the same issue?

      Reply: Yes, these all are clones of the same issue.

   2) What differences, if any, are there in zip.vim and zipplugin.vim?

      Reply: zip.vim defines the functions (zipBrowse, zipRead, zipWrite),
             zipPlugin.vim "only calls" them.

   3) Given the varying results for TAR-1 through TAR-4, should zip.vim
      be split from the tar issues?  What about zipplugin.vim?

      Reply: The issue in its nature is the same as by TAR plugin
            (inproper sanitization of the '!' character as in the tar
             archives, but projected to zip archives)

Part 5 -- Needed actions:
==========================

  1, Remove bullet (2) -- mention about zipplugin from CVE-2008-2712.
  2,

     a, either merge TAR, ZIP Vim issues under CVE-2008-3074 and reject CVE-2008-3075.
        This one is the PREFERRED SOLUTION.

     Proposed description of CVE-2008-3074:

     "The shellescape() function in Vim 7.0 through 7.2 does not properly escape
      all special items (in particular the '!' character). This results in
      untrusted data being insufficiently sanitized, possibly leading to
      arbitrary code execution as demonstrated on VIM TAR plugin
      (tar.vim) from v.10 through v.22 or VIM ZIP plugin (zip.vim) from version v.11
      through v.21."

       <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html> (Part 3.4.2.4. zip.vim)

     b, or modify descriptions of CVE-2008-3074 and CVE-2008-3075.

     Proposed description of CVE-2008-3074:

Are you sure 3 new CVEs are needed for this second rdancer advisory?
Advisory text itself only speaks of netrw issues and it's not quite
obvious to me why zip and tar tests are included in the test suite.
Maybe just to point out that those issues are still unfixed.

Moreover, if you diff zipplugin directories in vulnerablevim.tar.bz2
and vulnerablevim-netrw.tar.bz2, you will see this test did not change
at all between the two test suites.  So CVE-2008-3075 should already
be covered by previous CVE-2008-2712.

tarplugin test was updated since the first test suite to use different
payload.  I'm not really sure if it is the same issue or not, but the
new exploit is blocked by the previously proposed Jan's patch.  So it
may be the same issue as described in the first advisory.  Btw,
CVE-2008-2712 description does not mention tar.vim issue.  It is
described in 3.4.2.3, but its test does not seem to be run when doing
make test for the top-most Makefile in the first test suite.

Jonathan, did new netrw tests work for you?  With which vim version?
They all failed for me with vim 7.1.245 / netrw 109.

Adding also Jan to CC, in case he is interested in tossing in some
comments.  For some context for discussion, you can see:

  <http://marc.info/?t=121541947300001&r=1&w=4>

Jan, feel free to ignore this discussion if you are not interested,
though your comments are welcome.

Thanks!

Hi!

Thanks for CCing me.  Thomas's observations are right.

Indeed, I included all that had not been fixed in the test suite.

The zip exploit is the same.  It still has not been fixed as of Vim
7.2a.19/zip.vim v19.

There are two attack vectors, both fixed in the original patch of
mine.  I only updated the tarplugin exploit to use the other vector.

That's correct, I omitted the test from the top-most Makefile by mistake.

Hope that helps.
Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I do apologize: as written in the advisory, the version I worked with
was 7.1.298.  7.1.314 was only partly vulnerable.  FWIW, I have
updated the advisory at <http://www.rdancer.orgvulnerablevim.html> .

Thanks to Bram for all the good work.

7.2a.10 with updated runtime is still vulnerable to the zipplugin
attack, and an updated tarplugin attack:

-------------------------------------------
-------- Test results below ---------------
-------------------------------------------
filetype.vim
  strong  : EXPLOIT FAILED
  weak    : EXPLOIT FAILED
tarplugin : EXPLOIT FAILED
tarplugin.updated: VULNERABLE
zipplugin : VULNERABLE
xpm.vim
  xpm     : EXPLOIT FAILED
  xpm2    : EXPLOIT FAILED
  remote  : EXPLOIT FAILED
gzip_vim  : EXPLOIT FAILED
netrw     : EXPLOIT FAILED

The original tarplugin exploit now produces a string of telling error messages:

        /bin/bash: so%: command not found
        tar: /home/rdancer/vuln/vim/tarplugin/sploit/foo'|sosploit/foo:
Cannot open: No such file or directory
        tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
        /bin/bash: retu: command not found
        /bin/bash: bar.tar|retu|'bar.tar: command not found

It's easy to see that it is still possible to execute arbitrary shell commands.

$VIMRUNTIME/autoload/tar.vim of Vim 7.2a.10:

        136   if tarfile =~# '\.\(gz\|tgz\)$'
        137 "   call Decho("1: exe silent r! gzip -d -c
".s:Escape(tarfile)." | ".g:tar_cmd." -".g:tar_browseoptions." - ")
       *138    exe "silent r! gzip -d -c -- ".s:Escape(tarfile)." |

        139   elseif tarfile =~# '\.lrp'

       *141    exe "silent r! cat -- ".s:Escape(tarfile)."|gzip -d -c

        142   elseif tarfile =~# '\.bz2$'

       *144    exe "silent r! bzip2 -d -c -- ".s:Escape(tarfile)." |
".g:tar_cmd." -".g:tar_browseoptions." - "
        145   else
        146 "   call Decho("4: exe silent r! ".g:tar_cmd."
-".g:tar_browseoptions." ".s:Escape(tarfile))
      **147    exe "silent r! ".g:tar_cmd." -".g:tar_browseoptions."
".s:Escape(tarfile)
        [...]
        444 fun s:Escape(name)
        445   " shellescape() was added by patch 7.0.111
        446   if exists("*shellescape")
        447    let qnameq= shellescape(a:name)
        448   else
        449    let qnameq= g:tar_shq . a:name . g:tar_shq
        450   endif
        451   return qnameq
        452 endfun

 (*) s:Escape() does not suffice, as it fails to escape ``%'' and friends.

(**) tar(1) allows arbitrary command execution via options ``--to-command'',
     and ``--use-compress-program''.

The updated tarplugin attack is rather simple:

        $ rm -rf ./*
        $ touch "foo%;eval eval \`echo 0:64617465203e2070776e6564 |
xxd -r\`;'bar.tar"
        $ vim +:q ./foo*
        $ ls -l pwned
        -rw-r--r-- 1 rdancer users 29 2008-07-01 20:18 pwned

Cheers,
Jan Minar.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=467432#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-10-17 13:18:59 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Jan Minar has reported the following problem present in Vim shellescape() function implementation and demonstrated by testcases in zip.vim plugin:  The implementation of the shellescape() function does not properly escape all special items, in particular the '!' character). This can result in untrusted data being insufficiently sanitized and possibly lead to arbitrary code execution.  To show this vulnerability can be exploited, the tar.vim plugin test cases has been updated (zipplugin and zipplugin.v2 test cases).  [CVE-2008-3075](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-3075) as been pre-assigned and used in rPath advisory:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/10/7> (ZIP-2)  References:  <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-shellescape.html> <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html> (ZIP-1) <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/2> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/13/1> (ZIP-4) <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/08/01/1>  [CVE-2008-2712](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-2712) bullet (2)  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2712>  mentions zipplugin based on same advisory as ZIP-1. According to ZIP-2 and ZIP-4 the zip.vim / zipplugin.vim has not been fixed as of Vim 7.2a.19/zip.vim v19, so the bullet (2) -- mention about zipplugin should be removed from [CVE-2008-2712](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-2712).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=467432#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-10-17 13:21:11 UTC  ``` This issue does not affect the versions of the Vim package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3 and 4.   This issue affects the versions of the Vim package, as shipped with Red Hat Enteprise Linux 5 and Fedora releases of 8 and 9 (only Vim 7.0 and 7.1 affected).  This issue does not affect the version of the Vim package as shipped with Fedora rawhide release (alredy fixed in Vim 7.2).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=467432#c5)  Red Hat Product Security    2009-01-09 08:35:34 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0580.html>  Fedora (updated to upstream 7.2.060):    <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F9/FEDORA-2008-10587>   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F10/FEDORA-2008-10644>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=467432#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-02-24 10:38:17 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2008-3075](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-3075) to the following vulnerability:  The shellescape function in Vim 7.0 through 7.2, including 7.2a.10, allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via the "!" (exclamation point) shell metacharacter in (1) the filename of a ZIP archive and possibly (2) the filename of the first file in a ZIP archive, which is not properly handled by zip.vim in the VIM ZIP plugin (zipPlugin.vim) v.11 through v.21, as demonstrated by the zipplugin and zipplugin.v2 test cases. NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2008-2712](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-2712). NOTE: this issue has the same root cause as [CVE-2008-3074](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-3074). NOTE: due to the complexity of the associated disclosures and the incomplete information related to them, there may be inaccuracies in this CVE description and in external mappings to this identifier.

No problem.  Your inputs are really appreciated, as you obviously spent
a lot of time on researching those issues.

I believe this is already corrected in your updated test suite:

Regarding those new netrw issues:

- Issues 1 (netrw.v2) and 2 (netrw.v3) (for mz and mc commands) does not
seem to affect any stable version of vim.  Support for those commands
was only added after vim 7.1 and should only affect 7.2 alpha (and
possibly also beta, which was released this week iirc).

- Issue 3 (netrw.v4) affects netrw versions of netrw as shipped with
vim 7.0 and 7.1.  This problem does not seem to affect explorer.vim
used by vim 6.x.

Steven, are you going to split / de-dupe CVE ids based on this
information and the information in my post in other thread:

<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/2> ?

Sounds like this may be a good split, but I'm afraid I'll get stoned
for causing another CVE headache mess:
- CVE-2008-2712 - first advisory; xpm, filetype, gzip tests; affects
vim 6.0+, possibly older (not checked)
- CVE-new1 - first + second advisory; netrw and netrw.v4 tests; vim 7.0+
- CVE-new2 - first advisory; netrw test; explorer.vim on vim 6.x,
possibly older
- merged CVE-2008-3074 and CVE-2008-3075 - first + second advisroy;
tarplugin* and zipplugin tests; vim 7.0+
- CVE-new3 - second advisory; netrw.v2 and netrw.v3 tests; vim 7.2a+

Of course, this split takes into account first affected version, not
when the issue got / will get fixed.  I believe not all issues are
already fixed upstream.  Bram, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

Additionally, netrw.v3 uncovered one old bug affecting some 6.2 and 6.3
vim versions.  On affected versions, it triggers heap buffer overflow,
when vim is used to open file or directory with specially crafted name.

The problem is in the mch_expand_wildcards() in os_unix.c.  Problem was
introduced in 6.2.429:
  <http://vim.cvs.sourceforge.net/vim/vim/src/os_unix.c?view=log#rev1.104>
  ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/6.2.429

After applying this patch, following occurs:
- vim tries to run external command to perform shell expansion, to
calculate a buffer size needed to store this command, following code is
used:

  /* "unset nonomatch; print -N >" plus two is 29 */
  len = STRLEN(tempname) + 29;
  for (i = 0; i < num_pat; ++i)       /* count the length of the patterns */
      len += STRLEN(pat[i]) + 3;      /* add space and two quotes */
  command = alloc(len);

(i.e. expected command is: <some fixed length prefix> <space> <quote>
<pattern from file/directory name> <quote>, possibly with multiple
patterns).

However, later in the code, more complex quoting is used, which quotes
being added around spaces and 's, so patterns with lots of spaces can
easily trigger command buffer overflow:

    if (vim_strchr((char_u *)" '", pat[i][j]) != NULL)
    {
        *p++ = '"';
        while (pat[i][j] != NUL
                && vim_strchr((char_u *)" '", pat[i][j]) != NULL)
            *p++ = pat[i][j++];
        *p++ = '"';
    }
    else
        *p++ = pat[i][j++];

Issue was addressed upstream in:
  <http://vim.cvs.sourceforge.net/vim/vim/src/os_unix.c?view=log#rev1.111>
  ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/6.3/6.3.059

Memory requirement computation phase was updated to take this quoting
mechanism into account.  This was further re-written for vim 7.0 in:
  <http://vim.cvs.sourceforge.net/vim/vim7/src/os_unix.c?r1=1.49&r2=1.50>

Steven, can you please allocate an id for this heap corruption
affecting 6.2.429 - 6.3.059?  Thanks!

The problem in the zip plugin has already been fixed, but the file
wasn't distributed yet.  It's now on
ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/autoload/zip.vim

Charles is working on further problems with the netrw plugin.  I'm
waiting for this to make the Vim 7.2b BETA release.

Steve, could we get CVEs assigned, please? I'd imagine we'd need three;
one for the tarplugin issue, one for the zipplugin, and one for the
netrw issues (which are similar enough to probably justify lumping them
together).

Bram, have you had a chance to look at this yet? The advisory included a
patch for one of the issues, but not others.

Thanks in advance to you both.

Also potentially of interest: on rPath Linux 2 and Foresight Linux 2, I
get the following with vim 7.1 (it could be due either to version skew
between me and the reporter or due to how we build vim):

tarplugin.updated: VULNERABLE
zipplugin : VULNERABLE
netrw.v2  : EXPLOIT FAILED
netrw.v3  : EXPLOIT FAILED
netrw.v4  : EXPLOIT FAILED

On rPath Linux 1, with vim 6.3, I get the following:

tarplugin.updated: EXPLOIT FAILED
zipplugin : EXPLOIT FAILED
netrw.v2  : EXPLOIT FAILED
netrw.v3  : EXPLOIT FAILED
netrw.v4  : EXPLOIT FAILED

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- vim, gvim
The VI Improved editor (vim) was prone to several security problems:
CVE-2008-4677: The netrw plugin sent credentials to all servers.
CVE-2008-2712: Arbitrary code execution in vim helper plugins
filetype, zip, xpm, gzip and netrw.
CVE-2008-3074: tarplugin code injection
CVE-2008-3075: zipplugin code injection
CVE-2008-3076: several netrw bugs, code injection
CVE-2008-6235: code injection in the netrw plugin
CVE-2008-4677: credential disclosure by netrw plugin
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
On openSUSE vim was upgraded to version 7.2.108 to fix those issues.
SLES9 and 10 were only affected by a subset, patches were backported
to fix the problems.
- apache2
A DoS condition in apache2's mod\_proxy has been fixed
(CVE-2008-2364).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3
- opera
Opera 9.64 is a recommended security and stability upgrade,
incorporating the Opera Presto 2.1.1 user agent engine. Opera highly
recommends all users to upgrade to Opera 9.64 to take advantage of
these improvements (CVE-2009-0914, CVE-2009-0915, CVE-2009-0916).
A detailed changelog can be found at
<http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/964/>
- multipath tools
/var/run/multipathd.sock was world-writable allowing local users to
issue commands to the multipath daemon (CVE-2009-0115).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES10
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
Specially crafted image files could cause an integer overflow in the
lcms library contained in openjdk. Attackers could potentially
exploit that to crash applications using lcms or even execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0581, CVE-2009-0733).
Previous update packages contained broken dependencies and couldn't
be installed. Therefore the update had to be re-released.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1
- imp
Version update to IMP 4.1.6 fixes a problem with validating HTTP requests that
allowed attackers to delete emails (CVE-2007-6018) and some
cross-site-scripting issues (CVE-2009-0930).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- horde
Version update to horde 3.1.9 fixes a cross-site-scripting (XSS) issue
(CVE-2008-5917) and an include file problem (CVE-2009-0932).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- lcms
Specially crafted image files could cause an integer overflow in
lcms. Attackers could potentially exploit that to crash applications
using lcms or even execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0723,
CVE-2009-0581, CVE-2009-0733).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
- moodle
moodle was prone to several cross-site-scripting (XSS) and
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) problems (CVE-2009-0499, CVE-2009-0500,
CVE-2009-0501, CVE-2009-0502).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- ghostscript
Integer overflows and missing upper bounds checks in Ghostscript's
ICC library potentially allowed attackers to crash Ghostscript or
even cause execution of arbitrary code via specially crafted PS or
PDF files (CVE-2009-0583, CVE-2009-0584).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES9, SLES10

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- NetworkManager
The NetworkManager update caused WLAN to stop working on some
systems. Those systems most likely have a stale directory
/var/run/dbus/at\_console/root. It's most likely a leftover from a
root session. Removing the directory and restarting networking
should fix the problems. Please avoid logging in as root in the future.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
