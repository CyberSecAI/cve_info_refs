```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to local file inclusion due to insufficient sanitization of the 'lang' GET parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files on the server, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or remote code execution depending on the included file's content.",
   "Attack vectors": [
        "By manipulating the 'lang' GET parameter in the URL to include local files using path traversal sequences like '../../../../..'",
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The 'register_globals' PHP setting must be enabled on the server for successful exploitation."
