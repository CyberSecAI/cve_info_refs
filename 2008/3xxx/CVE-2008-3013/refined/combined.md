# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-052 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in GDI+ Could Allow Remote Code Execution (954593)

Published: September 09, 2008 | Updated: March 10, 2009

**Version:** 4.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows GDI+. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted image file using affected software or browsed a Web site that contains specially crafted content. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008, Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 when installed on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Microsoft Digital Image Suite 2006, SQL Server 2000 Reporting Services Service Pack 2, all supported editions of SQL Server 2005, Microsoft Report Viewer 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package, and Microsoft Report Viewer 2008 Redistributable Package.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Office XP; Microsoft Office 2003; all affected Office Viewer software for Microsoft Office 2003; 2007 Microsoft Office System; all affected Office Viewer software for 2007 Microsoft Office System; Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Expression Web, Microsoft Expression Web 2, Microsoft Office Groove 2007 and Microsoft Office Groove 2007 Service Pack 1; Microsoft Office Project 2002; Microsoft Visio 2002; Microsoft Office PowerPoint Viewer 2003; Microsoft Works 8; and Microsoft Forefront Client Security 1.0. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that GDI+ handles viewing malformed images. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 954593](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/954593) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

**\*Windows Server 2008 Server Core installation not affected.** The vulnerabilities addressed by this update do not affect supported editions of Windows Server 2008 if Windows Server 2008 was installed using the Server Core installation option, even though the files affected by these vulnerabilities may be present on the system. However, users with the affected files will still be offered this update because the update files are newer (with higher version numbers) than the files that are currently on your system. For more information on this installation option, see [Server Core](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms723891%28vs.85%29.aspx). Note that the Server Core installation option does not apply to certain editions of Windows Server 2008; see [Compare Server Core Installation Options](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/compare-core-installation.aspx).

**I donât have Microsoft Works 8 on my system, but Microsoft Office installed a Works subdirectory with gdiplus.dll in it. Is my system vulnerable?**

The copy of gdiplus.dll in the Works subdirectory is not used by any vulnerable software and will not need to be updated when Microsoft Works is not installed.

**I have a non-vulnerable version of software installed, why am I being offered this update?**

Some of the non-affected software including Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats contain the vulnerable shared office components, but because they do not access the vulnerable code, they are not affected by this vulnerability. However, since the vulnerable code is present, this update will be offered.

**The last Microsoft Security Bulletin for GDI+, MS04-028, lists affected and non-affected software that is not listed in this bulletin. Why?**

The software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which supported versions or editions are affected and which supported versions are not affected. Other versions or editions listed in the MS04-028 are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

**Why are Microsoft .NET Framework, Microsoft Visual Studio, and Microsoft Visual FoxPro listed in the Affected Software table if they are not impacted by the vulnerabilities described by this bulletin?**

Microsoft has not identified any attack vectors for these vulnerabilities specific to the affected software updated for Microsoft .NET Framework, Microsoft Visual Studio, or Microsoft Visual FoxPro. This security update is offered to developers that use Microsoft .NET Framework, Microsoft Visual Studio, or Microsoft Visual FoxPro so that they may issue their own updated version of their applications.

**Is Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 affected by the vulnerabilities listed in this bulletin?**

No. By default, Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 is not affected, and will not be offered the update. However, the following software are vulnerable when installed on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4:

* Microsoft Internet Explorer 6
* Microsoft Forefront Client Security 1.0

These software are only vulnerable when installed on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.

As part of the cumulative servicing model for Microsoft Office XP, this security update for Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 3 (KB938464) also addresses the vulnerability described in MS08-055. Users with Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 3 installed will have to install this security update but will only need to install it once.

**I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2. Are any additional security features included in this update?**

Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2003, when users of Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. All updates released after January 1, 2008 for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 will include these security features, which were introduced in Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951646](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/951646).

**If I have an installation of SQL Server, how am I affected?**

Affected SQL Server software may host the RSClientPrint ActiveX control if SQL Server Reporting Services is installed. The RSClientPrint ActiveX control distributes a copy of gdiplus.dll containing the affected code. However, this ActiveX control is only affected when installed on Microsoft Windows 2000 operating systems, or on affected Windows operating systems that have not yet installed the provided update. SQL Server Reporting Services is an optional component and must be installed for this security update to apply. Affected installations of SQL Server will only be offered this update if SQL Server Reporting Services is installed.

**Which editions of Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Service Pack 2 include SQL Server Reporting Services?**

SQL Server Reporting Services is an optional component on the following editions of Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Service Pack 2:

* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Enterprise Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Standard Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Developer Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Workgroup Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Evaluation Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Enterprise X64 Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Standard X64 Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Developer x64 Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Evaluation x64 Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Standard Edition for Itanium-based Systems
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Developer Edition for Itanium-based Systems
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Evaluation Edition for Itanium-based Systems
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition with Advanced Services

**What is the RSClientPrint ActiveX control?**

The Microsoft ActiveX control, RSClientPrint, provides client-side printing for reports viewed in HTML Viewer. It provides a **Print** dialog box so that a user can initiate a print job, preview a report, specify pages to print, and change the margins. During a client-side print operation, the report server renders the report as an Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image and uses the print capabilities of the operating system to create the print job and send it to a printer. For more information on the RSClientPrint ActiveX control, see [Using the RSClientPrint Control in Custom Applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms159195%28sql.90%29.aspx).

**I have SQL Server Reporting Services installed and I have Microsoft Windows 2000 clients. What actions should I take?**

First, you should apply the security update to your SQL Server Reporting Services servers. Once that installation is complete, you should have your Microsoft Windows 2000 clients connect to the SQL Server Reporting Services server: this will automatically update the ActiveX control on the Microsoft Windows 2000 systems.

**I have SQL Server Reporting Services installed and I have Windows clients for versions other than Microsoft Windows 2000. What actions should I take?**

You should apply the security update to your SQL Server Reporting Services servers. In addition, you should apply the security update available for the version of Microsoft Windows appropriate to the Windows client systems.

**Is there a preferred order for updating my operating systems and installations of SQL Server?**

The vulnerability addressed in this security update affects Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 operating systems with the RSClientPrint ActiveX control, as well as the affected SQL Server software.

For affected installations of SQL Server software that have not applied the security update:

* Customers with Microsoft Windows 2000 operating systems with the RSClientPrint ActiveX control installed must manually apply the provided kill bit workaround for the RSClientPrint ActiveX control for maximum security.
* Customers who are running Windows XP onwards and have installed the operating system update do not need to take any further action, as the RSClientPrint ActiveX control will use the operating system version of gdiplus.dll.

For affected installations of SQL Server software that have applied the security update:

* Customers with Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 operating systems with the RSClientPrint ActiveX control installed will be offered the updated ActiveX control when they next attempt to initiate a print job.
* Customers who are running Windows XP onwards and have installed the operating system update do not need to take any further action, as the RSClientPrint ActiveX control will use the operating system version of gdiplus.dll. However, these clients will also be offered the updated ActiveX control when they next attempt to initiate a print job.

**I am a third-party application developer and I use gdiplus.dll in my application. Is my application vulnerable and how do I update it?**

Developers who redistribute gdiplus.dll should ensure that they update the version of gdiplus.dll installed with their application by downloading the update provided in this bulletin. Developers are encouraged to follow recommended best practices for using a shared component. For more information on best practices on shared component use, please see the [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 835322](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/835322) on Isolated Applications.

**I am developing software which contains the redistributable file gdiplus.dll. What do I do?**

You should install the security update included in this security bulletin for your development software. If you have redistributed gdiplus.dll with your application, you should issue an updated version of your application to your customers with the updated version of this file included in the download of this security update for your development software.

**If third-party applications use or install the affected gdiplus.dll component, could I still be vulnerable even after I have installed all required Microsoft security updates?**

No, this security update replaces and re-registers the affected component provided with the operating system. If third party applications follow the recommended best practices for using a shared component as a side-by-side assembly then they are also not affected. Customers are potentially at risk if third party applications do not follow the recommended best practices and instead redistribute an old version of gdiplus.dll with their application. Customers who wish to manually check for the registered affected files can compare applications installed on their systems against those listed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 954593](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/954593). Customers are encouraged to contact their third party solutions developer for additional information.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**What is GDI+?**

GDI+ is a graphics device interface that provides two-dimensional vector graphics, imaging, and typography to applications and programmers.

**What is VML?**

Vector Markup Language (VML) is an XML-based exchange, editing, and delivery format for high-quality vector graphics on the Web that meets the needs of both productivity users and graphic design professionals. XML is a simple, flexible, and open text-based language that complements HTML. For more information on the VML, see the [product documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb250524.aspx).

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these software versions or editions, visit [Microsoft Product Support Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).

## GDI+ VML Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2007-5348

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI+ handles gradient sizes. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user browses to a Web site that contains specially crafted content. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-5348](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-5348).

#### Mitigating Factors for GDI+ VML Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2007-5348

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for GDI+ VML Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2007-5348

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Restrict access to gdiplus.dll**

#### FAQ for GDI+ VML Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2007-5348

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overrun when GDI+ improperly processes gradient sizes handled by the vector graphics link library.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail messages, visiting Web sites, or opening files from a network share for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail messages are read, where Internet Explorer is used frequently, or where users have network share access, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that GDI+ processes gradient sizes handled by the vector graphics link library.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### FAQ for GDI+ EMF Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3012

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by a memory corruption when GDI+ improperly processes a specially crafted EMF image file.

**What is the Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image format?**

An EMF image is a 32-bit format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. This format is an improvement over the Windows Metafile Format and contains extended features.

For more information about image types and formats, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320314](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/320314). Additional information about these file formats is also available at the [MSDN Library Web Site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms536391.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open or view a specially crafted image file.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted EMF image file or an Office document with a specially-crafted EMF image file embedded in it to the user and by convincing the user to open the document or view the e-mail containing the specially crafted image file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail messages, visiting Web sites, or opening files from a network share for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail messages are read, where Internet Explorer is used frequently, or where users have network share access, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that GDI+ handles memory allocation with EMF image files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## GDI+ GIF Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3013

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI+ parses GIF images. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted GIF image file or browses to a Web site that contains specially crafted content. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-3013](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3013).

#### Mitigating Factors for GDI+ GIF Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3013

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### FAQ for GDI+ WMF Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3014

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overrun when GDI+ improperly allocates memory when parsing a specially crafted WMF image file.

**What is theWindows Metafile (WMF) image format?**

A WMF image is a 16-bit metafile format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. It is optimized for the Windows operating system.

For more information about image types and formats, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320314](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/320314). Additional information about these file formats is also available at the [MSDN Library Web Site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms536391.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open or view a specially crafted image file.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted EMF image file or an Office document with a specially-crafted EMF image file embedded in it to the user and by convincing the user to open the document or view the e-mail containing the specially crafted image file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail messages, visiting Web sites, or opening files from a network share for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail messages are read, where Internet Explorer is used frequently, or where users have network share access, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that GDI+ allocates memory for WMF image files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## GDI+ BMP Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3015

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI+ handles integer calculations. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted BMP image file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-3015](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3015).

An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a BMP-format image file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince the user to open the file in an affected application.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail messages, visiting Web sites, or opening files from a network share for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail messages are read, where Internet Explorer is used frequently, or where users have network share access, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that GDI+ handles integer calculations when processing BMP files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

  **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.

  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

  **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

  **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.

  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

  **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Removing the Update**

This update cannot be uninstalled.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the âMicrosoft Baseline Security Analyzerâ heading under the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance,** earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

  **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.

  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

  **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

  **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.

  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

  **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.

This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.

To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

* [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

|Switch|Description|
|------------|------------|
|/?|Displays the command-line options.|
|Setup Modes|
|/q[:u | :a]|/q - Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts.\ /q:u - Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.\ /q:a - Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.|
|Install Options|
|/C|Extracts the files without installing them. If /t: path is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.|
|/T:path|Specifies the target folder for extracting files.|
|/C:path|Specifies the UNC path and name of the Setup .inf or .exe file.|
|/n:v|No version checking - Install the package over any previous version.|
|Restart Options|

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Removing the Update**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the âMicrosoft baseline Security Analyzerâ heading under the section, Microsoft Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

  **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.

  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

  **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.

This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.

To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

* [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

Supported Security Update Installation Switches

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/quiet** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/extract** | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/extract:<path>** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the âMicrosoft baseline Security Analyzerâ heading under the section, Microsoft Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

  **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.

  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

  **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

### Windows GDI+ GIF memory corruption

There is a memory corruption vulnerability in GIF file processing in Microsoft GDI+ that can be used to crash a vulnerable application and potentially execute arbitrary code.

*The vulnerability*

The vulnerability is caused due to improper handling of graphic control extension when processing malformed GIF files. The vulnerability can be triggered if a large number of extension markers (0x21) followed by unknown labels is found when processing a GIF file.

*Impact*

This vulnerability can be used to corrupt memory of any application utilizing GDI+ for GIF file decoding if it is used to open a malformed GIF file. This could lead to code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.

*References*

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
