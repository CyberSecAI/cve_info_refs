  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insecure handling of the 'book_id' parameter in the 'info_book.asp' page.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Blind SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can extract sensitive information such as member passwords from the database.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is remote and through the 'info_book.asp' page.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability."

  "technical_details": {
    "vulnerable_page": "info_book.asp",
        "vulnerable_parameter": "book_id",
    "exploit_code": "The provided Perl script exploits the vulnerability by crafting SQL queries and observing the response to determine characters of the password. It uses a substring function in the SQL query to extract each character of the password, comparing it with a character from 48 to 122 ASCII code. The response is checked for the presence of 'tourterms.pdf' which is used as a signal if the character is correct, essentially performing blind sql injection."
