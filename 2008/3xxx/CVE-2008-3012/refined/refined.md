    "content": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI+ handles memory allocation. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted EMF image file or browses to a Web site that contains specially crafted content. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\nMitigating Factors for GDI+ EMF Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3012\n* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user.\n* The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file.\n* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability.\n* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration.\n\nWorkarounds for GDI+ EMF Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3012\n* Restrict access to gdiplus.dll\n* Unregister vgx.dll\n* Prevent RSClientPrint from running in Internet Explorer\n\nFAQ for GDI+ EMF Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3012\n* What is the scope of the vulnerability? This is a remote code execution vulnerability.\n* What causes the vulnerability? The vulnerability is caused by a memory corruption when GDI+ improperly processes a specially crafted EMF image file.\n* How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability? This vulnerability requires that a user open or view a specially crafted image file. In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted EMF image file or an Office document with a specially-crafted EMF image file embedded in it to the user... In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site.\n* What does the update do? The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that GDI+ handles memory allocation with EMF image files."
