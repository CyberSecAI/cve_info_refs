{
  "CVE-2008-3128": {
    "Description": "Pivot 1.40.5 is vulnerable to a credentials disclosure vulnerability via the 'load_template()' function due to insufficient input validation.",
    "Root cause": "The 'load_template()' function in /modules/module_parser.php does not properly sanitize the 't' parameter passed to it from the search.php script. Specifically, it passes this parameter directly to the file() function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The 'load_template()' function lacks proper input sanitization or validation for the template filename, allowing directory traversal.",
      "The `file()` function is used without verifying if the provided path is within the intended directory."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server by providing a manipulated 't' parameter via a GET or POST request. This includes sensitive files, such as the configuration file (pv_cfg_settings.php), containing admin credentials (username/md5 hash/sessions).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted 't' parameter through a GET or POST request to the search.php script.",
      "Directory traversal sequences (e.g., '../') in the 't' parameter allow access to files outside the designated template directory."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
