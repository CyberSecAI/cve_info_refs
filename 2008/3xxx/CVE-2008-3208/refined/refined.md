    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the application's improper handling of multiple DNS reply packets.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) is achieved by overwhelming the server with a large number of specially crafted DNS reply packets, leading to partial availability impact. The server may crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack via UDP"

    "Simple DNS Plus 4.1",
    "Simple DNS Plus 5.0",
    "Possibly other versions before 5.1.101"
