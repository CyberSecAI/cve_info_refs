  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Improper input sanitization in the password reset functionality.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass the token verification and reset the password of any user, including the administrator. This leads to complete compromise of the Joomla installation.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted 'token' parameter in a POST request to the `/components/com_user/controller.php` endpoint, specifically within the `confirmreset` function. The attacker uses a single quote character to exploit the SQL injection.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable Joomla installation. They must also be able to identify the vulnerable endpoint, `/index.php?option=com_user&view=reset&layout=confirm`."
