Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3372:

**CVE Description:**
The provided text states "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval". Therefore, the official description is not available in the current context. However, the exploit-db content does provide some insight.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `sb_protype` parameter of the `search_form.php` script.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input (`sb_protype` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the `search_form.php` script, specifically targeting the `sb_protype` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application, meaning they can be remote.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, such as administrative credentials (as demonstrated in the provided exploit which targets the `sbprj_admin` table).
*   **Potential for further attacks:** Depending on database permissions, an attacker could potentially modify data, or perform further attacks.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to inject malicious SQL code. Specifically, the exploit concatenates `sb_admin_name` and `sb_pwd` from `sbprj_admin` using `concat_ws`, separated by a colon.
*   The provided example URL demonstrates how an attacker can access sensitive data.

```
www.[target].com/Script/search_form.php?sb_showresult=1&sb_protype=-2+UNION+SELECT+1,concat_ws(0x3a,sb_admin_name,sb_pwd),3+from+sbprj_admin--
```

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit targets Getacoder clone scripts using the `sb_protype` parameter.
* The exploit was published on 2008-07-27.
* The identified vulnerable application is 'Getacoder Clone Script (sb_protype)'.
