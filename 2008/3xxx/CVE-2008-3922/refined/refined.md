```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The AWStats Totals PHP script, specifically versions prior to 1.15, is vulnerable to arbitrary command execution due to insufficient input sanitization when handling the 'sort' parameter.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Remote Command Execution: A remote attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the 'sort' parameter, which are then executed by the server via the `passthru()` function, gaining command execution rights with the privileges of the web server user.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (mentioned but not detailed in exploit code).
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    - Unauthorized access to system files.
    - Possible privilege escalation.
    - Data theft or manipulation.
    - Server defacement.
- Attack vectors:
    - HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `awstatstotals.php` script.
    - Malicious input injected into the `sort` parameter within the GET request URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    - No prior authentication is required.
    - No specific network position is necessary as the exploit is performed over HTTP.
