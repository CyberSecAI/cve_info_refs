    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-3301",

        {
          "type": "Login Bypass",
          "description": "When `register_globals` is enabled, an attacker can bypass the login authentication by directly setting the `$login` and `$password` variables through the URL. This allows bypassing the intended login mechanism and setting the `admin_login` session variable, gaining unauthorized admin access.",
           "attack_vector": "Directly accessing the login.php file with crafted URL parameters.",
            "required_capabilities": "register_globals must be enabled on the server."

          "type": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
          "description": "Multiple XSS vulnerabilities exist.  \n\n    - Permanent XSS: When an admin posts an article, the `enCode` function cleans HTML characters, but  `widget.php` applies `stripslashes()` and `html_entity_decode()` to the content before printing it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the database and execute it when the widget is displayed. \n   - Unpermanent XSS: By injecting code into the `titleId` URL parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript within the `<head>` tag on the index.php page. XSS is also possible in admin files and footer.php by injecting malicious code through URL parameters.",
          "attack_vector": "Posting articles containing malicious code in the admin panel and using crafted URLs to trigger XSS via the widget and other application components.",
            "required_capabilities": "Admin access to inject content in the database and ability to craft URL parameters."

        {
          "type": "SQL Injection",
          "description": "The delete.php script is vulnerable to SQL Injection. By sending a crafted POST request to delete.php, an attacker can inject SQL code into the query to delete articles due to unsanitized input in the 'num' parameter, and magic quotes being disabled.",
          "attack_vector": "Sending crafted POST request to delete.php with malicious SQL in 'num' parameter.",

          "description": "The application reveals its full path in error messages and through direct access to specific files.",
          "attack_vector": "Directly accessing specific files like 'footer.php' with specific parameters or by accessing 'pagination.php'.",
