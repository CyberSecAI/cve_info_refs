Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3791:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure usage of a temporary file when rotating JPEG images. Specifically, during rotation, `gpicview` uses the hardcoded temporary file name `/tmp/rot.jpg`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure temporary file creation:** The program uses a fixed filename ("/tmp/rot.jpg") for the temporary file. This allows an attacker to create a symbolic link to another file on the system before `gpicview` creates the temporary file, which then overwrites the targeted file.
- **Symlink attack:**  An attacker can create a symbolic link from `/tmp/rot.jpg` to a file they want to overwrite. When gpicview saves the rotated image to this temporary path it follows the symlink and overwrites the targeted file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary file overwrite:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to overwrite any file on the system accessible to the user running `gpicview`.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** The attack requires local access to the system.
- **Symlink creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a symlink at `/tmp/rot.jpg` before `gpicview` is executed.
- **File modification via gpicview:** The user opens a JPEG image in `gpicview` and rotates the image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user account on the system.
- Ability to create symbolic links in the `/tmp` directory.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided patch addresses the vulnerability by replacing the usage of the fixed `/tmp/rot.jpg` with a call to `mkstemp` to generate a unique temporary file name within `/tmp`. This prevents the symlink attack.
- The report also mentions a related CVE-2008-3904 related to code execution via crafted filenames. While the original report bundled multiple issues, this CVE specifically addresses the insecure temporary file creation.
