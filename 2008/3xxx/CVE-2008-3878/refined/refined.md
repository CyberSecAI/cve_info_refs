Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2008-3878:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `HttpUpload` method of the Ultra Shareware Office Control ActiveX control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The ActiveX control's `HttpUpload` method is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The vulnerability lies in insufficient bounds checking when handling the input parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system. This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely via a malicious web page using Internet Explorer that loads and interacts with the vulnerable ActiveX control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page and entice a victim to visit it with a vulnerable version of the ActiveX control installed. No specific privileges are required beyond this.
- The user needs to use Internet Explorer and have the vulnerable ActiveX control installed.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by providing a large string as an argument to the `HttpUpload` method, thus overflowing a buffer.
- The exploit uses JavaScript to create a large string, allocate heap memory, and then trigger the overflow via the ActiveX control, injecting shellcode.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit code is designed for educational purposes and was tested on Windows XP Professional SP3 with Internet Explorer 7.
- The provided exploit specifically targets the `HttpUpload` method, and overflows a buffer by crafting an oversized input value.
- The exploit includes shellcode for code execution.
