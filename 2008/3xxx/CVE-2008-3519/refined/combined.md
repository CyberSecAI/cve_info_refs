| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=458823#c0)  Marc Schoenefeld    2008-08-12 14:38:24 UTC  ``` The JBossAs component in EAP has the DownloadServerClasses property set to 'true' in 'production'. For a production environment it should default to 'false' to  prevent download of non-EJB classes, which may cause information leakage.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=458823#c1)  Vincent Danen    2010-12-23 22:27:42 UTC  ``` This was addressed via:  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 for RHEL 4 AS (RHSA-2008:0831) JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 for RHEL 5 Server (RHSA-2008:0832) JBoss Enterprise Application Platform for RHEL 4 AS (RHSA-2008:0833) JBoss Enterprise Application Platform for RHEL 5 Server (RHSA-2008:0834)   ``` |  |
