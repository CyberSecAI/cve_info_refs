```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The 'idDirectory' parameter in the `directory.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Blind SQL Injection. The application does not sanitize user-supplied input in the `idDirectory` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database such as usernames and passwords.
- Attack vectors: By manipulating the `idDirectory` parameter in the URL of `directory.php` with specially crafted SQL queries.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable URL and be able to manipulate the idDirectory parameter to inject SQL queries.
