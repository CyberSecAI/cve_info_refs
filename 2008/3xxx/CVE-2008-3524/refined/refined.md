Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-3524:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `initscripts`' use of `find -L /var/lock /var/run ! -type d -exec rm -f {} \;` during system startup.
*   The `-L` option in the `find` command causes it to follow symbolic links. This, combined with the removal command, allows for the deletion of arbitrary files by crafting malicious symlinks in `/var/lock` or `/var/run`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Symbolic Link Following:** The primary vulnerability is the use of the `-L` flag in the `find` command. This causes `find` to dereference symbolic links, leading it outside of the intended `/var/lock` and `/var/run` directories.
*   **Unrestricted Removal:** The `rm -f` command is used to delete files found by the `find` command, providing no safeguards against deleting system files if a malicious symlink is followed.
*   **Writable directories:** Daemons often create writable subdirectories under /var/run or /var/lock. If a daemon is compromised, an attacker could create a symlink pointing to arbitrary files outside those directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System Wipe:** A compromised daemon could create a symbolic link that, when followed by the `find` command during startup, could lead to the deletion of critical system files. This leads to a system that is inoperable.
*   **'Command Not Found' Errors:** The vulnerability can cause numerous "command not found" errors during startup.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Daemon:** An attacker needs to compromise a daemon with the privilege to write to a subdirectory within `/var/run` or `/var/lock`.
*   **Symbolic Link Creation:** Once the daemon is compromised, the attacker creates a malicious symbolic link within a daemon-writable directory pointing to a sensitive file or directory.
*   **System Reboot:** The vulnerability is triggered upon system reboot, where the `initscripts`' `find` command with `-L` follows the malicious symlink leading to the unintended removal of system files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Write Access:** The attacker needs the ability to write to a subdirectory of `/var/run` or `/var/lock`. This is typically achieved by compromising a daemon that writes into those directories.
*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local and does not require network access once a daemon is compromised. The user needs to be able to cause the system to restart for the malicious command to execute.
*   **Basic Linux knowledge** The attacker needs basic knowledge of Linux symbolic links, file paths, and permissions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present due to a change in `initscripts` that was introduced in Fedora 9.
*   The issue was fixed by removing the `-L` option from the `find` command, preventing it from following symbolic links outside of the intended directories.
*   The vulnerability is described as having a "low security issue" because it requires a compromised daemon with write privileges to `/var/run` or `/var/lock` to exploit. However, the impact is severe.
*  Some Fedora packages create world-writable subdirectories in /var/run, so any local unprivileged user can exploit this flaw without the need to compromise a daemon.
