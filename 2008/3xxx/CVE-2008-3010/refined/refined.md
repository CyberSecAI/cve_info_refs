CVE-2008-3010:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by Windows Media components incorrectly treating Internet resources as part of the Local Intranet zone when connecting to a server using an ISATAP address.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Information disclosure vulnerability. The affected Windows Media components fail to properly distinguish between internal and external network resources when using ISATAP addresses.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially obtain the NTLM credentials of the logged-on user by tricking the user into accessing a malicious server using an ISATAP address. These credentials could potentially be used to execute code with the same rights as the logged-on user, if they can reflect the credentials back to the user system.
  - Attack vectors: An attacker would need to host a malicious server (e.g. a web site) using an ISATAP address. The victim would need to access this resource, which is typically achieved by persuading them to click a malicious link.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to host a malicious server using an ISATAP address. They also need to trick the victim into accessing this malicious server via an affected Windows Media component.
