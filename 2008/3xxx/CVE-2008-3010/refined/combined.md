# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-076 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in Windows Media Components Could Allow Remote Code Execution (959807)

Published: December 09, 2008 | Updated: November 24, 2009

**Version:** 5.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in the following Windows Media components: Windows Media Player, Windows Media Format Runtime, and Windows Media Services. The most severe vulnerability could allow remote code execution. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for Windows Media Player 6.4, Windows Media Format Runtime 7.1, Windows Media Format Runtime 9.0, Windows Media Format Runtime 9.5, Windows Media Format Runtime 11, Windows Media Services 4.1, Windows Media Services 9 Series, and Windows Media Services 2008. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the first vulnerability by modifying the way that Windows Media authentication replies are validated. The security update addresses the second vulnerability by ensuring that Windows Media clients treat servers using ISATAP addresses as external. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

**Known Issues.** None

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## SPN Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3009

A credential reflection vulnerability exists in the Windows Media components that could allow an attacker to execute code with the same rights as the local user or with Windows Media Services distribution credentials. The vulnerability exists due to weaknesses in Service Principal Name (SPN) implementations within Windows Media components.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-3009](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3009).

#### Mitigating Factors for SPN Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3009

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Windows Media Services is an optional component on all Windows Server platforms and is not installed by default.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
* For Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 x64-based Systems, Windows Media Format Runtime 11 is only present on the system when Desktop Experience is installed.

#### Workarounds for SPN Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3009

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for SPN Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3009

**What is the scope of the vulnerability ?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute code with the same rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could also execute code with Windows Media Services distribution credentials. In this instance, an attacker could execute code with the same rights as the NETWORK SERVICE account.

**What causes the vulnerability ?**

Windows Media components do not correctly opt-in to NTLM credential-reflection protections to ensure that a user's credentials are not reflected back at the userâs system and used to impersonate the user.

**What are Service Principle Names (SPNs) ?**

A service principal name (SPN) is the name by which a client uniquely identifies an instance of a service. The SPN provides a service identity type used for authenticating the service to the client. When a client wants to connect to a service, it locates an instance of the service, composes an SPN for that instance, connects to the service, and presents the SPN for the service to authenticate. For additional information on SPN, see [Service Identity and Authentication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms733130.aspx). For additional information on how SPNs should be formatted, see [Name Formats for Unique SPNs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms677601%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do ?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability ?**

This vulnerability requires that a user with an affected version of Windows Media components access a malicious server. An attacker could host a malicious server share or Web site that requires authentication. When the client connects and authenticates to the malicious server, the attacker can use the credentials provided by the client to reflect back to the client, or forward the credentials on to other servers, thereby mimicking the client. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted server share or Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the server share or Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability ?**

Any system using the affected versions of Windows Media Player, Windows Media Format Runtime, or Windows Media Services is at risk from this vulnerability. Any systems that these components use frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do ?**

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Windows Media Component authentication replies are validated to prevent the replay of credentials.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed ?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited ?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## ISATAP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3010

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in supported versions of Windows Media components that could result in the disclosure of NTLM credentials. Any Windows Media component that accesses a URL that uses an ISATAP address could leak the userâs NTLM credentials to the server that hosts the URL. This could allow an attacker who is external to the intranet zone to gather NTLM credentials for an enterprise environment.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-3010](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3010).

#### Mitigating Factors for ISATAP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3010

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect network resources from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports and protocols exposed.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
* For Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 x64-based Systems, Windows Media Format Runtime 11 is only present on the system when Desktop Experience is installed.

#### Workarounds for ISATAP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3010

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block IP Protocol Type 41 (ISATAP) at the firewall**

  The ISATAP protocol is defined as protocol type 41 by [RFC4214: Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4214.txt). Blocking this protocol type at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports or protocols.

#### FAQ for ISATAP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3010

**What is the scope of the vulnerability ?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the NTLM credentials of the logged-on user. These credentials may be subsequently reflected back to the userâs system to execute code with the same rights as the logged-on user.

**What causes the vulnerability ?**

The affected Windows Media components incorrectly treat Internet resources as a part of the Local Intranet zone when connecting to a server that is using an ISATAP address.

**What is ISATAP ?**

The Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) provides IPv6 connectivity within an IPv4 Intranet. The RFC for ISATAP is hosted by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). For information on ISATAP, see [RFC4214: Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4214.txt).

**What is NTLM ?**

NTLM is an authentication protocol based on a challenge/response mechanism.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do ?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the userâs NTLM credentials.  These credentials may be subsequently reflected back to the userâs system to execute code with the same rights as the logged-on user.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability ?**

This vulnerability requires that a user with an affected version of Windows Media components access a malicious server. An attacker could host a malicious server share or Web site that requires authentication. When the Client connects and authenticates to the malicious server the attacker can use the credentials provided by the client to reflect back to the client, or forward the credentials on to other servers, thereby mimicking the client. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted server share or Web site.

| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the SP2QFE, or SP3QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies SP2GDR, or SP3GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
