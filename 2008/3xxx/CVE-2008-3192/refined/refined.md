  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2008-3192",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to both SQL injection and Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient input validation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection: The application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input used in SQL queries.",
        "Local File Inclusion: The application allows arbitrary file inclusion via a parameter."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database through SQL injection, including user credentials. Additionally, LFI allows an attacker to include and potentially execute arbitrary local files on the server, potentially leading to further compromise of the system, such as uploading a malicious php file as described in the note.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "SQL Injection: By injecting malicious SQL code into the 'page' parameter of the URL.",
         "Local File Inclusion: By manipulating the 'module' parameter in the URL."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is needed for SQLi and LFI attacks."
    }
