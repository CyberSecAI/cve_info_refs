        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection due to unsanitized user input in the 'cat' parameter within the 'mojoClassified.cgi' script.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the 'cat' parameter.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by using boolean-based blind SQL injection techniques. In this specific exploit, the attacker extracts the MD5 hash of the password from the 'member' table.",
        "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests by crafting malicious SQL queries within the 'cat' parameter of 'mojoClassified.cgi'.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable 'mojoClassified.cgi' script and needs to be able to interpret the response to extract the desired information via blind SQL injection techniques."
