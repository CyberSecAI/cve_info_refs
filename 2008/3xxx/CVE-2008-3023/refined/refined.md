```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in FreeStyleWiki.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Cross-site scripting (XSS).

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into FreeStyleWiki pages. If a user views a specially crafted page using Internet Explorer or other browsers that use the IE engine, the attacker's script can be executed within the user's browser. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user to malicious sites, or modifying the content of the viewed page.

Attack vectors:
The attack can be carried out remotely over the internet. The attacker crafts a malicious link or modifies a file in FreeStyleWiki, which when viewed in the browser, executes the injected script.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the FreeStyleWiki. No authentication is needed to perform the attack.  The user needs to interact with the crafted content, for example by clicking a link or viewing a specially crafted page.
