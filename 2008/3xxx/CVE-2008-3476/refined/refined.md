Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-3476:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer's attempt to access uninitialized memory. Specifically, when handling HTML objects, the browser may try to access memory that hasn't been properly initialized or has already been released/deleted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core vulnerability is memory corruption due to improper handling of uninitialized memory when dealing with HTML objects.
- **Uninitialized Memory Access:** The vulnerability occurs because Internet Explorer tries to access memory that has not been properly allocated or has already been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine within the context of the logged-on user.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could potentially gain full control over the system. They could install malware, steal data, or create new user accounts with administrative rights.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with limited user rights could gain the same privileges as the user running Internet Explorer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can craft malicious web pages to trigger the vulnerability when viewed by users through Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Legitimate websites could be compromised to host the malicious content and infect visitors.
- **Malicious Advertisements:** Attackers can embed the exploit in advertisements on legitimate or malicious websites.
- **Phishing:** Attackers can trick users into visiting malicious websites through phishing emails or instant messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to host a webpage:** Attackers need a means to host the malicious web page they crafted.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must visit the specially crafted webpage with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer. This is typically achieved by tricking the user into clicking a link, which redirects them to the attackers controlled webpage.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability only affects Internet Explorer versions prior to version 7.
- The provided information includes references to Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-058 which addresses CVE-2008-3476, along with several other vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.
- The bulletin emphasizes the importance of installing the security update promptly.
- Mitigations are described such as disabling active scripting or setting higher security levels for Internet Explorer zones, which can reduce the chances of an attack.
