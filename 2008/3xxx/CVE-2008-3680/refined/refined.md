  "CVE-2008-3680": {
    "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in Ventrilo server versions 3.0.2 and earlier. By sending a specially crafted packet with an invalid version number, followed by another packet, a remote attacker can cause the server to crash due to a NULL pointer dereference during packet decryption.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly initialize decryption keys after receiving an invalid version string in the initial connection packet.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
        "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the Ventrilo server.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote, exploiting the server's network service.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server. No specific authentication is required."
