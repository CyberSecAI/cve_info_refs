# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- apache2
The security update of apache2 released at 2008/11/05 packages its modules
differently (/usr/lib/apache2-prefork vs. /usr/lib/apache2-worker). This
can, in seldom cases, cause a services (like iPrint) stop working if it
expects the modules in a special directory.
New packages will be released as soon as possible.
- ipsec-tools
Remote attackers could exploit memory leaks in the 'racoon' daemon
to crash it (CVE-2008-3651, CVE-2008-3652)
Affected products: all
- kernel-bigsmp
This kernel update fixes various bugs and also several security issues:
CVE-2008-4576: Fixed a crash in SCTP INIT-ACK, on mismatch between SCTP
AUTH availability. This might be exploited remotely for a denial of
service (crash) attack.
CVE-2008-3833: The generic\_file\_splice\_write function in fs/splice.c
in the Linux kernel does not properly strip setuid and setgid bits
when there is a write to a file, which allows local users to gain the
privileges of a different group, and obtain sensitive information or
possibly have unspecified other impact, by splicing into an inode in
order to create an executable file in a setgid directory.
CVE-2008-4210: fs/open.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22 does not
properly strip setuid and setgid bits when there is a write to a file,
which allows local users to gain the privileges of a different group, and
obtain sensitive information or possibly have unspecified other impact,
by creating an executable file in a setgid directory through the (1)
truncate or (2) ftruncate function in conjunction with memory-mapped I/O.
CVE-2008-4302: fs/splice.c in the splice subsystem in the Linux
kernel before 2.6.22.2 does not properly handle a failure of the
add\_to\_page\_cache\_lru function, and subsequently attempts to unlock a page
that was not locked, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
(kernel BUG and system crash), as demonstrated by the fio I/O tool.
CVE-2008-3528: The ext[234] filesystem code fails to properly handle
corrupted data structures. With a mounted filesystem image or partition
that have corrupted dir->i\_size and dir->i\_blocks, a user performing
either a read or write operation on the mounted image or partition can
lead to a possible denial of service by spamming the logfile.
CVE-2007-6716: fs/direct-io.c in the dio subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly zero out the dio struct, which allows local users to
cause a denial of service (OOPS), as demonstrated by a certain fio test.
CVE-2008-3525: Added missing capability checks in sbni\_ioctl().
CVE-2008-3272: Fixed range checking in the snd\_seq OSS ioctl, which
could be used to leak information from the kernel.
CVE-2008-2931: The do\_change\_type function in fs/namespace.c did not
verify that the caller has the CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN capability, which allows
local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service by modifying
the properties of a mountpoint.
CVE-2008-2812: Various NULL ptr checks have been added to tty op
functions, which might have been used by local attackers to execute
code. We think that this affects only devices openable by root, so the
impact is limited.
CVE-2008-1673: Added range checking in ASN.1 handling for the CIFS and
SNMP NAT netfilter modules.
CVE-2008-3527: arch/i386/kernel/sysenter.c in the Virtual Dynamic Shared
Objects (vDSO) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.21 did not
properly check boundaries, which allows local users to gain privileges
or cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors, related to the
install\_special\_mapping, syscall, and syscall32\_nopage functions.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2
- flash-player
This update of flash-player fixes several critical security vulner-
abilities that couls lead to remote system compromise.

CVE-2008-4503, CVE-2008-4546)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-11.0, Novell Linux Desktop 9,
SLED 10 SP1 and SP2
- mysql
Empty bit-strings in a query could crash the MySQL server (CVE-2008-3963).
Due to another flaw users could access tables of other users (CVE-2008-
4097, CVE-2008-4098).
Affected products: all (so far only released for SLES10, others will
follow)

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE request: MySQL empty bit-string literal server crash

Hi,

we consider the following bug a security issue. I'm not sure whether
MySQL upstream feels so as well. Quoting the ChangeLog:

  An empty bit-string literal (b'') caused a server crash. Now the value
  is parsed as an empty bit value (which is treated as an empty string
  in string context or 0 in numeric context). (Bug#35658)

Bug:
  <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=35658>

ChangeLogs:
* 5.0.66
  <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/releasenotes-es-5-0-66.html>
* 5.1.26
  <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-26.html>
* 6.0.6
  <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/6.0/en/news-6-0-6.html>

Gentoo handles this as bug 237166 [ <https://bugs.gentoo.org/237166> ].

Thanks,
Robert

# USN-671-1: MySQL vulnerabilities

17 November 2008

MySQL vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [mysql-dfsg-5.0](/security/cves?package=mysql-dfsg-5.0) -

## Details

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table

files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use the

DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly bypass privilege

checks. This update alters table creation behaviour by disallowing the

use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY

options. ([CVE-2008-2079](/security/CVE-2008-2079), [CVE-2008-4097](/security/CVE-2008-4097) and [CVE-2008-4098](/security/CVE-2008-4098))

It was discovered that MySQL did not handle empty bit-string literals

properly. An attacker could exploit this problem and cause the MySQL

server to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3963](/security/CVE-2008-3963))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.51a-3ubuntu5.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.51a-3ubuntu5.4)

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.45-1ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.45-1ubuntu3.4)

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06.11](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06.11)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : mysql-dfsg-5.0
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-3963 CVE-2008-4456
Debian Bug     : 498362

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified affecting MySQL, a
relational database server, and its associated interactive client
application.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following two problems:

CVE-2008-3963

    Kay Roepke reported that the MySQL server would not properly handle
    an empty bit-string literal in an SQL statement, allowing an
    authenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (a crash)
    in mysqld.  This issue affects the oldstable distribution (etch), but
    not the stable distribution (lenny).

CVE-2008-4456

    Thomas Henlich reported that the MySQL commandline client application
    did not encode HTML special characters when run in HTML output mode
    (that is, "mysql --html ...").  This could potentially lead to
    cross-site scripting or unintended script privilege escalation if
    the resulting output is viewed in a browser or incorporated into
    a web site.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch10.

For the stable distribution (lenny),  these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.51a-24+lenny1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Description:
Using an empty binary value leads to server crash in Item_bin_string::Item_bin_string

How to repeat:
From a mysql client do
select b'';

The server crashes.

Suggested fix:
Fix Item_bin_string::Item_bin_string to deal with the empty string.
```

[28 Mar 2008 19:05]

```
select x'';

does not cause a crash. Comparing the two methods should indicate the fix.

  [Bug#35658](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=35658) (An empty binary value leads to mysqld crash)

  Before this fix, the following tokens:
    x''
    b''
  were parser by the lexer as a HEX_NUM and BIN_NUM, but with a wrong value.
  This caused the parser to later crash when using the value string (for
  binary), or produce undocumented results (x'' was considered an hexadecimal
  value of 0).

  With this fix, these tokens are properly detected as mal formed hexadecimal and
  binary literals.
```

```
According to the SQL standard (part 2 foundations, section 5.3 <literal>):

<binary string literal> ::=
    X <quote> [ { <hexit> <hexit> }... ] <quote>
    [ { <separator> <quote> [ { <hexit> <hexit> }... ] <quote> }... ]

That is, a binary string literal must have an even number of digits, and (!!!) zero digits is allowed.
```

Sergei,

After re-reading the grammar in the standard, I do not concur (at least not for the copy of SQL 99 I have).

There are two separate rules listed:
<hex string literal> ::=
    X <quote> [ <hexit>... ] <quote>
    [ { <separator> <quote> [ <hexit>... ] <quote> }... ]
and
<binary string literal> ::=
    X <quote> [ { <hexit> <hexit> }... ] <quote>
    [ { <separator> <quote> [ { <hexit> <hexit> }... ] <quote> }... ]

The first one would allow e.g. X'a'.
In fact, Syntax Rules 3) specifically states that both the following are equivalent:
X'0a' == X'0' 'a'.
Furthermore, the declared type of <hex string literal> is a fixed length bit string and those are not required to be of even length, AFAICS (according to section 4.4)

Do you know whether the above is correct and if the standard says anything about the expected value of B'' and X''?
```

[3 Apr 2008 12:20]
Kay Roepke
```
After discussing this, we determined that SQL2003 differs in its grammar from SQL99 (the one I looked at) and requires an even length of the hex digits in hex strings.

We should enforce an even length of hex literal strings and allow x'' to be the empty string (i.e. evaluate to 0 in numeric context). The same applies to b'' (without the even length requirement).

  Before this fix, the following token
    b''
  caused the parser to crash when reading the binary value from the empty string.
  The crash was caused by:
    ptr+= max_length - 1;
  because max_length is unsigned and was 0, causing an overflow.

  With this fix, an empty binary literal b'' is parsed as a binary value 0,
  in Item_bin_string.

      [Bug#35658](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=35658) (An empty binary value leads to mysqld crash)

      Before this fix, the following token
        b''
      caused the parser to crash when reading the binary value from the empty string.
      The crash was caused by:
        ptr+= max_length - 1;
      because max_length is unsigned and was 0, causing an overflow.

      With this fix, an empty binary literal b'' is parsed as a binary value 0,
      in Item_bin_string.
```

```
To better describe the format of hex values (and whether they require an even number of digits), I've added this paragraph to <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/hexadecimal-values.html>:

MySQL supports hexadecimal values, written using X'val', x'val', or
0xval format, where val contains hexadecimal digits (0..9, A..F).
Lettercase of the digits does not matter. For values written using
X'val' or x'val' format, val must contain an even number of digits.
For values written using 0xval syntax, values that contain an odd
number of digits are treated as having an extra leading 0. For
example, 0x0a and 0xaaa are interpreted as 0x0a and 0x0aaa.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
