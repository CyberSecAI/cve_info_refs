### Summary:
The provided documents describe a vulnerability in MySQL (CVE-2008-3963) related to the improper handling of empty bit-string literals, which could lead to a server crash.

### Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from the MySQL server's inability to correctly parse empty bit-string literals (e.g., `b''`) in SQL statements. Specifically, when encountering such literals, the server's code attempted to access memory locations using a zero-length value, resulting in a crash due to an integer overflow.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can cause a crash of the MySQL server by sending a query containing an empty bit-string literal.
- **Improper input handling:** The server's parser had a flaw in its logic to handle certain cases during parsing, which led to the crash.

### Impact of exploitation:
- **Server crash:** An attacker can force the MySQL server to terminate abruptly, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Service disruption:** The crash leads to unavailability of the database service, impacting applications that rely on the database.

### Attack vectors:
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted SQL query to the MySQL server.
- The query must contain an empty bit-string literal (e.g., `b''`).

### Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send queries to the MySQL server. This typically requires a valid database user account, unless the server allows unauthenticated queries.

### Additional details from the content:
- The vulnerability was present in multiple versions of MySQL (5.0, 5.1, and 6.0) and was fixed in subsequent releases (5.0.66, 5.1.26 and 6.0.6).
- The fix involves parsing empty bit-string literals as an empty bit value (which is treated as an empty string in a string context or as 0 in a numeric context)
- Several Linux distributions, including openSUSE, Ubuntu and Debian, have issued security advisories and updates addressing this vulnerability.
- The issue was tracked as bug #35658 in the MySQL bug tracker.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable through SQL queries.
- A similar issue with empty hexadecimal string literals (e.g., `x''`) was also investigated but was found not to cause a crash.
