- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient bounds checking when copying user-defined data into a stack-allocated buffer within the kernel during `nmount(2)` system call execution under specific error conditions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow due to lack of bounds checking when processing user-provided mount parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local privilege escalation leading to arbitrary code execution within the kernel context.
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation through the `nmount(2)` system call, achievable by unprivileged users if `vfs.usermount` is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local user with the ability to make `nmount(2)` system calls, which is possible if the sysctl `vfs.usermount` is set to 1.
