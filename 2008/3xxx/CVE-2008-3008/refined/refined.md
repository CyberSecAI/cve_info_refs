{
  "CVE-2008-3008": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the WMEX.DLL ActiveX control which is installed by Windows Media Encoder 9 Series.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer Overflow",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow remote code execution with the privileges of the user, potentially leading to complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full user rights.",
      "Attack vectors": "By convincing a user to view a specially crafted web page containing malicious content that exploits the vulnerable ActiveX control, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage, or inject malicious code in a trusted website, and convince a user to visit it. Requires the target system to have the vulnerable Windows Media Encoder component installed. The attacker also needs to create an exploit payload to cause the buffer overflow."
    },
    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WMEX.DLL ActiveX control, when used in Internet Explorer, is not correctly handling parameter validation, leading to the overflow.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unsafe use of ActiveX control in Internet Explorer combined with insufficient input validation allows for a buffer overflow.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve remote code execution with user privileges, potentially leading to full system compromise if the user has administrative rights.",
      "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted webpage, designed to trigger the overflow using the vulnerable ActiveX control, is used as an attack vector. This attack can be launched remotely.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position":"The attacker needs the ability to host malicious webpages or inject malicious code in web pages which are then visited by the targeted user. They also need to develop exploit code that can overflow the buffer when interacting with the ActiveX control. The target system must have the vulnerable version of Windows Media Encoder installed."
