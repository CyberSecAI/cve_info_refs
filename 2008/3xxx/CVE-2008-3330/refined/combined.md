Hello,

There is a small XSS/unescaped output (only exploitable by
someone who can create a contact, and requiring the victim to
have access to that contact).

This seems to be already fixed in unstable. Which version
did fix this? I can't see an old CVE id describing this
problem, is a new CVE id needed for this one?

Kind regards

Yes, sure! This issue is only for etch.

3.2.1+debian0-1 fixed it.

There is no CVE id for it. I'm not sure Debian needs a new CVE id
because upstream said only Horde 3.2 and Turba 2.2 are affected
(this versions are *not* in Debian). Today I'm reviewing old
issues and I find Horde 3.1 could also be affected: I sent
mail to upstream to ask confirmation. I propose you to wait his
answer.

But they were in the archive and other vendors might still have them in
their archive. I also added 2.2.1-1 as the fixed version in
the security tracker and requested a CVE id.

Cheers

P.S. Please mention such fixes as security fixes in the
changelog next time so we can get them easier on our
radars.

No, these versions were never in the archive.
But yes, other vendors could be affected.

Even if the version affected was not in Debian?

Now I am confused why you opened the bug report then :)
Anyway, every security issue should get a CVE id.
Even if no version in Debian was affected by this it helps
us to track the security issue.

No, sure not. I just saw you mentioned it in the turba
changelog (not as security fix) and not in the horde
changelog.

We released Horde 3.1.8 at the same time as 3.2.1 for this reason.

Date: Sun, 17 Aug 2008 02:56:45 +0200

Hello,

The package horde3 has a vulnerability (See [CVE-2008-3330](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3330) and
#492578).

I prepared fixed package for etch version (source package and
debdiff):
<http://gcolpart.evolix.net/debian/horde3/horde3_3.1.3-4etch4.dsc>
<http://gcolpart.evolix.net/debian/horde3/horde3_3.1.3-4etch3_3.1.3-4etch4.diff>

Information for the advisory:

8<----------------------------------
horde3 -- cross-site scripting vulnerability

Date Reported:
    ?? Aug 2008
Affected Packages:
    horde3
Vulnerable:
    Yes
Security database references:
    In Mitre's CVE dictionary: [CVE-2008-3330](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3330)
More information:

Looks good to me. Thanks for the work. Feel free to upload
this to security-master so someone from the stable team can
release it.

[...]

This is wrong, it is fixed in 3.2.1+debian0-1. Not affected
is only used if the package in Debian was never affected
because of a specific reason, like for example patched code.
If a vulnerable version was never in unstable we still
include version numbers for the tracker.

Kind regards
Nico

Ok but IANyADD (currently in NM), then I think it's not yet relevant.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
