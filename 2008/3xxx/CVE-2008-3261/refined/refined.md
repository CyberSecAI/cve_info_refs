  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-controlled input in the 'url' parameter of the 'redirector.php' script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "URL Redirection Vulnerability",
    "Phishing"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious website by crafting a URL with a malicious 'url' parameter value.",
  "Attack vectors": "A user can be tricked into clicking a malicious URL, leading them to an attacker-controlled site.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with a desired redirect destination and send it to a victim. No specific position within the network is required as this is a client-side vulnerability."
