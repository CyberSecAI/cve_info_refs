```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by an SQL injection flaw in the `urlrotator.php` script of the YourFreeWorld URL Rotator application.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input via the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords. This is achieved by injecting a `UNION SELECT` query to retrieve data from the `adminsettings` table.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the `tr.php` script.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable script, which would be anyone with access to the web server hosting the application.
