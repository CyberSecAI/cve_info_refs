**Root Causes and Weaknesses:**
* SQL Injection: Improper sanitization of user inputs leading to database manipulation.
* Broken Access Control: Lack of proper authorization checks, enabling unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.
* Improper Error Handling: The application is not properly handling errors and exceptions, possibly revealing sensitive data, or leading to unexpected behavior.
* Information Disclosure: Sensitive data is exposed due to lack of proper checks or configurations.
* Incomplete Blacklist: Insufficiently filtered input allowing for malicious code execution or data manipulation.
* Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity: Data is accepted without validating its origin or integrity.
* Unprotected test functionality: Test functionalities are accessible in production, leading to abuse.
* Suspectibility to DoS: A vulnerability that could be leveraged to perform a Denial of Service attack, possibly through an unprotected feature.
* Blind SQL Injection: A type of SQL Injection where the attacker cannot directly see the results of the SQL query.
* Cross Site Scripting (XSS): A vulnerability allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Data breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information due to SQL injection and broken access control.
* **Data manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data via SQL Injection.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Rendering the application unavailable by exploiting vulnerabilities.
* **Cross Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts that can steal user sessions, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of a user.
* **Information Disclosure**: Leaking of sensitive information that an attacker can exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **User Input:** Exploiting SQL injection by injecting malicious SQL code into user input fields, form submissions, or URL parameters.
*   **Direct Access:** Accessing unprotected test functionality or data due to lack of authorization checks.
*   **Blacklist Bypass:** Submitting data that bypasses implemented blacklist filters.
*   **Data Tampering:** Submitting manipulated data that is not properly verified for its authenticity.
*   **Malicious Scripts:** Injecting malicious scripts through user input fields to perform XSS attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Basic web request knowledge:** Attackers need to understand how to send requests to the web application.
*   **Targeted Vulnerability Knowledge:** Some attacks require understanding of the specific vulnerability, like SQL syntax or which parameters to inject.
*   **No special position is generally needed**: Attacks are done through a web browser or other tool that can craft web requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bulletin emphasizes that these are third-party extensions and not part of the TYPO3 core.
*   It encourages users to follow recommendations in the TYPO3 Security Guide and subscribe to the typo3-announce mailing list for future security updates.
*   Some extensions were removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository because the authors did not provide timely fixes.
