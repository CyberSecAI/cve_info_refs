{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `configvar` script in Caudium 1.4.12 creates a temporary file in `/tmp` with a predictable name, making it vulnerable to symlink attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary file creation",
      "Symlink vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Local users can overwrite arbitrary files on the system by creating a symlink with the same name as the temporary file generated by `configvar` before the script creates it.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Symlink attack"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create symlinks in `/tmp`."
