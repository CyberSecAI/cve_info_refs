Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-3119:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `page` parameter of the DreamPics Builder application. This allows for SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `page` parameter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to access sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials (usernames and passwords).
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable `page` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable DreamPics Builder application.
    *   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests and URL manipulation to craft the malicious SQL injection payload.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit demonstrates how to extract user credentials by injecting the following SQL query into the `page` parameter:

```
-2+union+select+null,null,null,null,concat_ws(0x3a,user_login,user_password),null,null,null+from+users--
```

This payload uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `users` table, specifically concatenating the `user_login` and `user_password` fields. The `0x3a` is the hexadecimal representation of a colon, used as a separator for easier reading.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a live demo URL that showcases the vulnerability.
*   The vendor is not explicitly named but it refers to "DreamLevels.com".
* The vulnerable application is described as "PICS BUILDER".
