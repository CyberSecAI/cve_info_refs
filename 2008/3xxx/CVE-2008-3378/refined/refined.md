Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3378:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `comment.php` file of FizzMedia version 1.51.2. Specifically, the `mid` parameter is not properly sanitized, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `mid` parameter in the `comment.php` script, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:**  Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database. In this specific example, the exploit uses `UNION SELECT` to extract the `user` and `pass` fields from the `admin` table.
- **Potential for Full System Compromise:** Depending on the application's permissions and the database structure, the attacker could potentially achieve deeper access to the system by further manipulating database queries, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `comment.php` file. The malicious SQL code is injected through the `mid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable FizzMedia instance. No specific authentication or privileged access is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attack can be performed remotely.
- **Understanding SQL:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL to craft the malicious injection string.

**Additional details:**

- The exploit provided uses `UNION SELECT` combined with `Concat_Ws` to extract the admin's username and password from the database.
- The exploit targets `comment.php?mid=-1'+UNION+SELECT+0,0,0,Concat_Ws(0x3a3a,user,pass)MrSQL,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0+FROM+admin/*`
- The identified vulnerable version of FizzMedia is 1.51.2
