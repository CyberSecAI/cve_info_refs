  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Improper session handling and lack of variable initialization in `login.php`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Login Bypass: Due to register_globals being enabled, uninitialized variables `$login` and `$password` can be set via URL parameters, bypassing the authentication check. The session variable `$_SESSION['admin_login']` is then set, granting admin access without proper login.",
         "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):",
          "  - Persistent XSS: The `widget.php` file applies `stripslashes()` and `html_entity_decode()` on content retrieved from the database, which is previously sanitized with `htmlentities()` and `addslashes()`. This allows stored XSS when an attacker, through an admin account, injects malicious code into the database.",
          "  - Unpermanent XSS:  The `head.php` file includes a title based on the URL's query string parameters. Specifically, when a non-numerical `titleId` parameter is provided it will be reflected in the title element, enabling arbitrary HTML injection.",
           "  - Unpermanent XSS: Various admin files and `footer.php` are vulnerable to XSS via URL parameters, such as `t_lang[lang_copyright]` or `content`.",
        "SQL Injection: The `delete.php` script uses user-supplied input to construct a SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code through the `num` parameter and execute arbitrary SQL commands (e.g. delete all articles).",
         "Full Path Disclosure: The `footer.php` and `pagination.php` scripts reveal the server's full file path, which can be used in further attacks."
      ],
      "impact": "Complete compromise of the BilboBlog application by taking admin privileges, arbitrary code execution via XSS injection on users' browsers and potential database compromise using SQL injection. Full path disclosure can assist further attacks",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Login Bypass: Directly accessing `login.php` with crafted URL parameters.",
        "Persistent XSS: Posting malicious content as an admin and having users view it via `widget.php`.",
         "Unpermanent XSS: Crafting URLs with malicious payload.",
         "SQL Injection: Sending a POST request to `delete.php` with malicious SQL code in the `num` parameter.",
          "Full Path Disclosure: Accessing the vulnerable files."

       "required_capabilities": [
         "Login Bypass: Register Globals must be enabled on the server.",
          "Persistent XSS: Requires an attacker to first gain administrator access, either through the login bypass or valid credentials.",
         "SQL Injection: Magic quotes must be disabled on the server.",
         "Full Path Disclosure: Requires direct access to the vulnerable URLs."
