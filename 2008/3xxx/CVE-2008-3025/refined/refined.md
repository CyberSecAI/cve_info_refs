Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `ad.php` script of plx Ad Trader v3.2, where the `adid` parameter is not properly sanitized, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL Injection (SQLi).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code to extract sensitive information from the database. In this specific example, the attacker can extract usernames and passwords of the `br_admins` table, leading to full administrative access to the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `ad.php` script, manipulating the `adid` parameter.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. No authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit demonstrates the following SQL injection payload:
```
adid=-12+UNION+SELECT+concat_ws(0x3a,login,pass)+from+br_admins--
```

This payload attempts to:
1.  `-12`: This likely bypasses an initial query to ensure the injection takes place.
2.  `UNION SELECT concat_ws(0x3a,login,pass)`: This injects a SQL query that selects all `login` and `pass` fields from the `br_admins` table, concatenating them with a colon (`:`) separator.
3.  `--`: This is a comment, which ensures the rest of the original SQL query is ignored.

The exploit then shows how to retrieve the user and password separately by selecting only the `login` or `pass` column, respectively.
