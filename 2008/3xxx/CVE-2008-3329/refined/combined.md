OpenBSD uses an old libevent-1.4.15 and it doesn't handle calling

Tue Oct 2 00:54:24 CEST 2018 mikulas:
Windows 7 has a bug (or feature) that corrupts the screen when using the
unaccelerated video driver - when a thread draws into window's device context
and the user simultaneously drags the window, the device context coordinates
may not be updated. Subsequent draws are done with incorrect coordinates.
In order to work around this bug, we detect that a drawing operation
possibly raced with window moving. If it did, we allocate a new DC (the
old one is corrupted) and start a timer that asks the main thread to
redraw the whole window using the new DC.
Sun Sep 23 22:02:09 CEST 2018 mikulas:
Add ascii replacement of Romanian S and T with comma
Fix replacement of c with cedilla and a/i with grave accent a/o/u with

Sat Jul 14 04:49:45 cet 2018 mikulas:
Implement dithering properly on OS/2 in 15-bit and 16-bit color mode
In 8-bit mode, Links may optionally use a private palette - it
improves visual quality of Links images, but degrades visual
quality of other concurrently running programs.

Improve scrolling smoothness when the user drags the whole document
Thu Jul 12 06:48:00 cet 2018 mikulas:

Trust Content-Length on HTTP/1.0 redirect requests
This fixes hangs with misbehaving servers that honor Connection:
keep-alive but send out HTTP/1.0 reply without Connection: keep-alive.
Links thought that they don't support keep-alive and waited for the
connection to close (for example http://www.raspberrypi.org/)

links users from each other based on installed certificates)
It also makes it possible to use certificate verification on systems
with no default certificate store
Sat May 27 21:17:28 CEST 2017 mikulas:

Replace OpenSSL malloc functions with CRYPTO\_set\_mem\_functions, so that
when malloc returns NULL, we can free some cached data and retry
Sat Feb 25 15:59:57 CET 2017 mikulas:
Avoid reallocating the line array over and over with the same size.
Most realloc implementations fall back to no operation if a memory chunk

copies the array - this resulted in quadratic complexity and performance
degradation on big files.

(i.e. when connecting to tor), we reset certain other options to their
default values, so that it is not possible to identify user behind tor
based on the selected options.

	Blacklist FORPSI server --- do not send Range: to it

Mon Apr 16 01:49:07 MET DST 2007 mikulas:

	Javascript was removed. The reason is that it is very buggy, Martin
	Pergel doesn't have time to develop it and code is so messy that no one
	else can understand it.

	If you use links for special purposes (embedded devices, etc.), you can
	bring javascript back by copying javascript files from previous release,
	removing "dnl javascript" lines from configure.in, adding *.c and *.h
	files to Makefile.am and re-running automake and autoconf.

	Javascript hooks from main code were not removed --- they just won't be
	maintained.

	anyone else, javascript will likely be removed in next release)

Sat Mar 31 03:02:40 CEST 2007 student:

	win32.c file removed because in each new version of windows it doesn't
	work. Don't even try to fix it unless you have computers with Windows
	NT, Window 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista side by side.

	(new Cygwin emulates xterm-like mouse on the console, so it's not needed
	for mouse)

	Cygwin sometimes doesn't send SIGWINCH, it is its bug, so I didn't try

		drawing doesn't synchronize with softcursor (seen on svgalib)
		stupid keyboard handling (SDL has the ability to query
			operating system keymap and translate keys to unicode
			but this driver didn't use it)
		doesn't support virtual devices with Alt-1 ... Alt-0, like
			svgalib and framebuffer
		reportedly crashes with sdl-1.2.10
