Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause lies in the flawed handling of remote management login failures by the Avaya SIP Enablement Services (SES) server. Specifically, two issues were identified:
    *   **Core Router Update Issue**: Invalid login attempts do not block core router updates, allowing remote systems to execute system updates despite failed authentication.
    *   **Alarm and Logging Issue**: The login and password for failed login attempts are exposed in alarm and system logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The failure to block core router updates upon invalid login attempts represents an authentication bypass vulnerability. This allows unauthorized remote systems to potentially modify the SES server's configuration or perform other administrative functions.
*   **Credential Exposure:** The logging of login credentials in alarms and system logs constitutes a credential exposure vulnerability. This can enable malicious actors who gain access to these logs to obtain valid usernames and passwords for the SES server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Service Disruption:** The ability to perform unauthorized system updates can lead to the SES server becoming unusable for handling SIP messages, resulting in disruption of service.
*   **Unauthorized System Control:** Malicious actors can gain unwanted system control, potentially leading to further compromise of the system or network.
*   **Credential Theft:** Exposure of login and password in logs can lead to compromised accounts and further unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable via remote management login attempts.
*   **Log Access:** The credential exposure vulnerability can be exploited by gaining access to the system's logs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the SES server's remote management interface.
*   **Malicious Intent:** The attacker needs the intent to exploit the login failure behavior to perform system updates or acquire credentials from log files.

**Additional Information:**

*   The affected products are Avaya SIP Enablement Services (SES) and Avaya Communication Manager (CM) 5.0 on S8300C with SES enabled.
*   The recommended action is to install SES 5.0 Service Pack 2d or later.
