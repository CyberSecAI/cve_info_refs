Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2008-3131:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `chatbox.php` file of pSys version 0.7.0 Alpha. Specifically, the `$showid` variable, which is directly taken from the `$_REQUEST['showid']` without proper sanitization, is used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a remote SQL injection. The lack of input sanitization for the `$showid` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Magic Quotes Dependency:** The exploitability is contingent on `magic_quotes_gpc` being disabled on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** A successful SQL injection allows the attacker to potentially read, modify, or delete arbitrary data from the database.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The impact includes partial compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack vector is through the `showid` parameter in the URL (HTTP GET request).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft the injection payload.
- **Target System Configuration Knowledge**:  The attacker must be aware that `magic_quotes_gpc` is disabled on the target server to successfully exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
12: $showid = $_REQUEST['showid'];
42: $sqlbefehl = "Select * FROM $tab_quick where id='$showid'";
```
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) is:
`http://127.0.0.1/psys/chatbox.php?showid=' union select 1,username,pwd,4,5,6,7,8 FROM ps_pfuser/*`

This SQL injection allows retrieval of user credentials from the database.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by DNX.
- The vendor provided a solution by offering updates via CVS.
- The CVSS score of 6.8 indicates a medium severity vulnerability.
- The CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
-  The exploit only works if the server's magic_quotes_gpc setting is disabled, which was common in older PHP versions.
