How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

MyBB 1.2.13 is a security update to the MyBB 1.2 series. It fixes 1 HIGH risk and 1 Medium risk security vulnerability. We recommend everybody upgrades to this release immediately or patches their boards with the manual patching instructions below.  These vulnerabilities affect MyBB 1.2.12 and previous releases of MyBB 1.2. Older versions of MyBB may also be affected.  Thanks to ostro for reporting these vulnerabilities.  MyBB 1.2.12 to MyBB 1.2.13 Patch This patch is only for users running MyBB 1.2.12. If you are running any other version of the MyBB 1.2 series then please download MyBB 1.2.13 from the MyBB site and update to it.  Please download the attached ZIP archive and replace the files in your forum directory with those from the ZIP archive.    .zip   [mybb\_1213\_changed\_files.zip](attachment.php?aid=9271 "2008-05-21, 12:38 AM") (Size: 20.08 KB / Downloads: 4,104)   If you wish to manually patch your board please download "mybb\_1213\_patches.txt" and follow the instructions in that file.    .txt   [mybb\_1213\_patches.txt](attachment.php?aid=9272 "2008-05-21, 12:38 AM") (Size: 2.19 KB / Downloads: 14,410)   For the upgrade of 1.2.12 to 1.2.13, the upgrader is NOT required -- just replace the files (or modify them as per the manual patch instructions) and you will be set.  Reporting MyBB security vulnerabilities If you think you've found a vulnerability in MyBB, we advise you not to publicly post it on these forums or publicly release information about it elsewhere until we've had time to prepare and release a patch.
