  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2008-3398",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to remote file inclusion.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
         "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
         "Information Gathering"
      ],

        "The RFI vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `$include_directory` variable in `activities/workflow-activities.php`. ",
        "XSS vulnerabilities exist in multiple files via the `$msg` variable."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The `register_globals` setting must be enabled on the server for the RFI vulnerability to be exploitable."
