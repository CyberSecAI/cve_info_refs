Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the WebCMS Portal's `index.php` file when handling the `menu=tablon&apartado=ver_anuncio` request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability.  The application directly incorporates user-supplied data (`id` parameter) into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:**  An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and email addresses.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** Successful exploitation could potentially allow an attacker to modify data, gain administrative access or perform further attacks depending on the database privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL. The provided example URL demonstrates this: `http://www.webcms.es/demos/portal/index.php?menu=tablon&apartado=ver_anuncio&id=-43+union+select+0,0,0,concat_ws(0x3a,login,password,email),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0+from+usuarios/*`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WebCMS application. No special privileges or local access is required.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:**  A basic understanding of SQL syntax is needed to craft the malicious SQL injection payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit example extracts user credentials (`login`, `password`, `email`) from the `usuarios` table.
*   The vulnerability affects the `index.php` file within the "menu" parameter section.
*   The provided exploit string uses a `UNION SELECT` to retrieve information from the database.
