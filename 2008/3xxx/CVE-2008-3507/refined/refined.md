- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `index.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database, potentially allowing them to read sensitive data (including database usernames/passwords from the configuration file), modify database contents, or potentially execute system commands.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `index.php` script, specifically the `mode=view&id=` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and must be able to inject SQL code into the `id` parameter.
