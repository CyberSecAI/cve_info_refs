Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3719

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `directory.php` script of the Affiliate Directory application. Specifically, the `id` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `directory.php` script, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
*  **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
    *  Retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as email addresses, passwords, and database version information.
    *  Potentially modify or delete data within the database, depending on the database user privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
    *   The vulnerable URL is similar to: `http://[target]/Script/directory.php?ax=deadlink&id=[malicious SQL]`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   No authentication or special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques is required to craft the malicious payload.
    *   The attacker needs to know the structure of the vulnerable SQL database to create the correct injection payload for desired results (dumping username and password hashes, for example).

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit provided uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract database information.
*   The injection point is the `id` parameter.
*   The payload attempts to retrieve `email`, `password`, `version()`, `user()`, and a hardcoded string.
*   The example exploit uses `-14` to ensure no valid record is returned.

**Exploit Example:**
```
www.[target].com/Script/directory.php?ax=deadlink&id=-14+union+select+1,2,concat_ws(0x3a,email,password,version(),user(),0x48757373696E5F58)+from+links--
```
