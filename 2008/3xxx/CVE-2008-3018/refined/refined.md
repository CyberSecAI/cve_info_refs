  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in how Microsoft Office handles PICT-format image files. Specifically, when opening a specially crafted PICT image file, a memory corruption may occur that allows arbitrary code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory Corruption",
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Remote Code Execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with the same user rights as the logged-on user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Email attachments",
      "Malicious websites hosting Office documents with crafted image files"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious PICT image file, embed it in an Office document or as a standalone file, and then convince a user to open it with an affected Microsoft Office application. The user must interact with the malicious file for the exploit to occur."
