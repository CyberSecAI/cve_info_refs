    {
      "cve": "CVE-2008-3153",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_b0990d1d_20250124_185844.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of the 'X-Forwarded-For' HTTP header, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Blind SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can retrieve sensitive information such as the administrator's username and hashed password from the database.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack vector is through the 'X-Forwarded-For' HTTP header.",
         "The attacker manipulates this header to inject malicious SQL code."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and manipulate the 'X-Forwarded-For' header. No prior authentication or specific positioning is required.",
      "additional_information": "The exploit uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique, specifically leveraging the `benchmark()` function to measure delays caused by the injected queries. The provided exploit code uses a character-by-character method to extract the admin username and password hash."
