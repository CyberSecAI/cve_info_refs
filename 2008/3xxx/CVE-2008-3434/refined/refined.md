- **Root cause of vulnerability:** iTunes periodically checks for software updates using an HTTP request, which is not secure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** iTunes uses an insecure HTTP request to check for updates. If Apple Software Update for Windows is not installed, the download URL from the HTTP response is opened in the user's default browser.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A man-in-the-middle attacker could offer malicious software disguised as an Apple software update.
- **Attack vectors:** A man-in-the-middle attacker could intercept the insecure HTTP request for updates and provide a malicious URL as the download location.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and modify network traffic between the user's machine and Apple's servers.
