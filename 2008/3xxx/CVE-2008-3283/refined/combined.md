| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=458977#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-08-13 15:22:19 UTC  ``` Richard Megginson identified multiple memory leaks affecting Red Hat Directory Server and Fedora Directory Server.  These issues may possibly be triggered by unauthenticated remote attackers with access to LDAP port.  An attacker can cause Directory Server to use excessive amount of memory, and possibly crash or terminate unexpectedly when running out of available memory.  Memory leaks that can be triggered by an anonymous user occur during authentication / bind phase, or in (anonymous) LDAP search requests.  Affected version: Red Hat Directory Server 7.1, 8.0 Fedora Directory Server 1.1.1 and earlier   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=458977#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-08-13 15:24:11 UTC  ``` See the dependency tree for bugs related to the individual issues.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=458977#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2008-08-27 20:18:55 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=458977#c4)  Yi Zhang    2008-09-02 22:04:55 UTC  ``` bug has been verified during last RHDS errata release. No additional test necessary in IPA errata release.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=458977#c5)  Fedora Update System    2008-09-11 16:57:58 UTC  ``` fedora-ds-base-1.1.2-1.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=458977#c6)  Fedora Update System    2008-09-11 17:04:56 UTC  ``` fedora-ds-base-1.1.2-1.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=458977#c7)  Vincent Danen    2010-12-23 22:02:52 UTC  ``` This was addressed via:  Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 (for AS v. 3) (RHSA-2008:0596) Red Hat Directory Server 8.0 (for AS v. 4) (RHSA-2008:0602) Red Hat Directory Server 8 (for RHEL 5 Server) (RHSA-2008:0602) Red Hat IPA 1 for RHEL 5 Server (RHSA-2008:0858   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
