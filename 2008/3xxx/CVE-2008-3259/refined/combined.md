OpenSSH: Security

## [*Open***SSH**](/) Security

---

OpenSSH is developed with the same rigorous security process that the
OpenBSD group is famous for. If you wish to report a security issue in
OpenSSH, please contact the private developers list <openssh@openssh.com>.

For more information, see the
[OpenBSD security page](https://www.openbsd.org/security.html).

* **July 1, 2024**

  sshd(8) in Portable OpenSSH versions 8.5p1 to 9.7p1 (inclusive).

  Race condition resulting in potential remote code execution.

  A race condition in sshd(8) could allow remote code execution as
  root on non-OpenBSD systems. This attack could be prevented by
  disabling the login grace timeout (LoginGraceTime=0 in
  sshd\_config) though this makes denial-of service against
  sshd(8) considerably easier.

  For more information, please refer to the
  [release notes](txt/release-9.8) and the report from the
  [Qualys Security Advisory Team](https://www.qualys.com/2024/07/01/cve-2024-6387/regresshion.txt) who discovered the bug.* **July 1, 2024**

    ssh(1) in OpenSSH versions 9.5p1 to 9.7p1 (inclusive).

    Logic error in ObscureKeystrokeTiming option.

    A logic error in the implementation of the ssh(1) ObscureKeystrokeTiming
    option rendered the feature ineffective and additionally exposed limited
    keystroke timing information when terminal echo was disabled, e.g. while
    entering passwords to su(8) or sudo(8). This condition could be avoided
    for affected versions by disabling the feature using
    ObscureKeystrokeTiming=no.

    For more information, please refer to the
    [release notes](txt/release-9.8).* **December 18, 2023**

      ssh(1), sshd(8) in OpenSSH prior to version 9.6.

      Weakness in initial key exchange ("Terrapin Attack")

      A weakness in the initial SSH protocol key exchange allows an
      on-path attacker to delete a number of consecutive messages from
      the early encrypted protocol without detection. While cryptographically
      novel, there is no discernable impact on the integrity of SSH traffic
      beyond giving the attacker the ability to delete the message that
      enables some features related to keystroke timing obfuscation.

      This attack is prevented by a new protocol extension in OpenSSH 9.6.

      For more information, please refer to the
      [release notes](txt/release-9.6).* **December 18, 2023**

        ssh-agent(1) in OpenSSH between 8.9 and 9.5 (inclusive)

        Incomplete application of destination constraints to smartcard keys.

        Destination constraints added when loading PKCS#11 keys from a token
        were being applied to only the first key returned from the token.

        This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.6.

        For more information, please refer to the
        [release notes](txt/release-9.6).* **July 19, 2023**

          ssh-agent(1) in OpenSSH between and 5.5 and 9.3p1 (inclusive)
          remote code execution relating to PKCS#11 providers

          The PKCS#11 support ssh-agent(1) could be abused to achieve remote
          code execution via a forwarded agent socket if the following conditions
          are met:
          + Exploitation requires the presence of specific libraries on the victim system.
          + Remote exploitation requires that the agent was forwarded to an attacker-controlled system.Exploitation can also be prevented by starting ssh-agent(1) with an
          empty PKCS#11/FIDO allowlist (ssh-agent -P '') or by configuring
          an allowlist that contains only specific provider libraries.

          This vulnerability was discovered and demonstrated to be exploitable
          by the Qualys Security Advisory team. This vulnerability has been
          assigned CVE-2023-38408.

          This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.3p2. For OpenBSD, an
          [errata](https://www.openbsd.org/errata.html)
          patch exists to fix this problem.

          For more information, please refer to the
          [release notes](txt/release-9.3p2).* **March 15, 2023**

            ssh-add(1) in OpenSSH between and 8.9 and 9.2 (inclusive).

            ssh-add(1) did not apply destination constraints to smartcard keys.

            When adding smartcard keys to ssh-agent(1) with the per-hop destination
            constraints (*ssh-add -h ...*), a logic error prevented the
            constraints from being communicated to the agent. This resulted in the
            keys being added without constraints. The common cases of
            non-smartcard keys and keys without destination constraints are
            unaffected.

            This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.3.

            For more information, please refer to the
            [release notes](txt/release-9.3).* **February 2, 2023**

              ssh(1) in OpenSSH between and 8.7 and 9.1 (inclusive).

              ssh(1) failed to correctly process PermitRemoteOpen options.

              The PermitRemoteOpen option
              would ignore its first argument unless it was one of the special
              keywords "any" or "none", causing the permission list to fail open
              if only one permission was specified.

              This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.2.

              For more information, please refer to the
              [release notes](txt/release-9.2).* **February 2, 2023**

                ssh(1) in OpenSSH between and 6.5 and 9.1 (inclusive).

                ssh(1) failed to check DNS names returned from libc for validity.

                If the CanonicalizeHostname and CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
                options were enabled, and the system/libc resolver did not check
                that names in DNS responses were valid, then use of these options
                could allow an attacker with control of DNS to include invalid
                characters (possibly including wildcards) in names added to
                known\_hosts files when they were updated. These names would still
                have to match the CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs allow-list, so
                practical exploitation appears unlikely.

                This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.2.

                For more information, please refer to the
                [release notes](txt/release-9.2).* **February 2, 2023**

                  sshd in OpenSSH between and 9.1 (only).

                  Double-free memory fault in pre-authentication sshd process.

                  sshd(8) contained a network-reachable pre-authentication double-free
                  memory fault introduced in OpenSSH 9.1. This is not believed to be
                  exploitable, and it occurs in the unprivileged pre-auth process that is
                  subject to chroot(2) and is further sandboxed on most major
                  platforms.

                  This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.2.

                  For more information, please refer to the
                  [release notes](txt/release-9.2).* **September 26, 2021**

                    sshd in OpenSSH between 6.2 and 8.7 (inclusive).

                    sshd(8) failed to correctly initialise supplemental groups when
                    executing an `AuthorizedKeysCommand` or
                    `AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand`, where a
                    `AuthorizedKeysCommandUser` or
                    `AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser` directive was been set to
                    run the command as a non-root user. Instead these commands would inherit
                    the groups that sshd(8) was started with.

                    Depending on system configuration, inherited groups may allow
                    the helper programs to gain unintended privilege.

                    Neither `AuthorizedKeysCommand` nor
                    `AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand` are enabled by default in
                    sshd\_config(5).

                    This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 8.8

                    For more information, please refer to the
                    [release notes](txt/release-8.8).* **March 3, 2021**

                      ssh-agent in OpenSSH between 8.2 and 8.4 (inclusive).

                      Double-free memory corruption. Mitigated by socket peer user identity
                      checking and double-free protection in malloc(3).
                      This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 8.5
                      For more information, please refer to the
                      [release notes](txt/release-8.5).* **October 3, 2017**

                        All version of OpenSSH prior to 7.6 supporting read-only mode in sftp-server
                        (introduced in 5.5).
                        Incorrect open(2) flags in sftp-server permitted creation
                        of zero-length files when the server was running in read-only mode (invoked
                        using the -R command-line flag).

                        This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 7.6.
                        For more information, please refer to the
                        [release notes](txt/release-7.6).* **March 9, 2016**

                          All versions of OpenSSH prior to 7.2p2 with X11Forwarding
                          enabled.
                          Missing sanitisation of untrusted input allows an
                          authenticated user who is able to request X11 forwarding
                          to inject commands to xauth(1).

                          Mitigate by setting **X11Forwarding=no** in sshd\_config, or on the
                          commandline. This is the default, but some vendors enable the feature.

                          For more information see [the advisory](txt/x11fwd.adv).

                          This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 7.2p2 and in OpenBSD's stable branch.
                          For more information, please

                            OpenSSH clients between versions 5.4 and 7.1 are vulnerable to
                            information disclosure that may allow a malicious server to retrieve
                            information including under some circumstances, user's private keys.
                            This may be mitigated by adding the undocumented config option
                            **UseRoaming no** to ssh\_config.

                              OpenSSH 7.0 contained a logic error in PermitRootLogin=
                              prohibit-password/without-password that could, depending on
                              compile-time configuration, permit password authentication to

OpenSSH 5.1 was released on 2008-07-22. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.
We have also recently completed another Internet SSH usage scan, the
results of which may be found at http://www.openssh.com/usage.html
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
http://www.openssh.com/donations.html
Changes since OpenSSH 5.0
=========================
Security:
\* sshd(8): Avoid X11 man-in-the-middle attack on HP/UX (and possibly
other platforms) when X11UseLocalhost=no
When attempting to bind(2) to a port that has previously been bound
with SO\_REUSEADDR set, most operating systems check that either the
effective user-id matches the previous bind (common on BSD-derived
systems) or that the bind addresses do not overlap (Linux and
Solaris).
Some operating systems, such as HP/UX, do not perform these checks
and are vulnerable to an X11 man-in-the-middle attack when the
sshd\_config(5) option X11UseLocalhost has been set to "no" - an
attacker may establish a more-specific bind, which will be used in
preference to sshd's wildcard listener.
Modern BSD operating systems, Linux, OS X and Solaris implement the
above checks and are not vulnerable to this attack, nor are systems
where the X11UseLocalhost has been left at the default value of
"yes".
Portable OpenSSH 5.1 avoids this problem for all operating systems
by not setting SO\_REUSEADDR when X11UseLocalhost is set to no.
This vulnerability was reported by sway2004009 AT hotmail.com.
New features:
\* Introduce experimental SSH Fingerprint ASCII Visualisation to ssh(1)
and ssh-keygen(1). Visual fingerprinnt display is controlled by a new
ssh\_config(5) option "VisualHostKey". The intent is to render
SSH host keys in a visual form that is amenable to easy recall and
rejection of changed host keys. This technique inspired by the
graphical hash visualisation schemes known as "random art[\*]", and
by Dan Kaminsky's musings at 23C3 in Berlin.
Fingerprint visualisation in is currently disabled by default, as the
algorithm used to generate the random art is still subject to change.
[\*] "Hash Visualization: a New Technique to improve Real-World
Security", Perrig A. and Song D., 1999, International Workshop on
Cryptographic Techniques and E-Commerce (CrypTEC '99)
http://sparrow.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects/validation/validation.pdf
\* sshd\_config(5) now supports CIDR address/masklen matching in "Match
address" blocks, with a fallback to classic wildcard matching. For
example:
Match address 192.0.2.0/24,3ffe:ffff::/32,!10.\*
PasswordAuthentication yes
\* sshd(8) now supports CIDR matching in ~/.ssh/authorized\_keys
from="..." restrictions, also with a fallback to classic wildcard
matching.
\* Added an extended test mode (-T) to sshd(8) to request that it write
its effective configuration to stdout and exit. Extended test mode
also supports the specification of connection parameters (username,
source address and hostname) to test the application of
sshd\_config(5) Match rules.
\* ssh(1) now prints the number of bytes transferred and the overall
connection throughput for SSH protocol 2 sessions when in verbose
mode (previously these statistics were displayed for protocol 1
connections only).
\* sftp-server(8) now supports extension methods statvfs@openssh.com and
fstatvfs@openssh.com that implement statvfs(2)-like operations.
(bz#1399)
\* sftp(1) now has a "df" command to the sftp client that uses the
statvfs@openssh.com to produce a df(1)-like display of filesystem
space and inode utilisation (requires statvfs@openssh.com support on
the server)
\* Added a MaxSessions option to sshd\_config(5) to allow control of the
number of multiplexed sessions supported over a single TCP connection.
This allows increasing the number of allowed sessions above the
previous default of 10, disabling connection multiplexing
(MaxSessions=1) or disallowing login/shell/subsystem sessions
entirely (MaxSessions=0).
\* Added a no-more-sessions@openssh.com global request extension that is
sent from ssh(1) to sshd(8) when the client knows that it will never
request another session (i.e. when session multiplexing is disabled).
This allows a server to disallow further session requests and
terminate the session in cases where the client has been hijacked.
\* ssh-keygen(1) now supports the use of the -l option in combination
with -F to search for a host in ~/.ssh/known\_hosts and display its
fingerprint.
\* ssh-keyscan(1) now defaults to "rsa" (protocol 2) keys, instead of
"rsa1".
\* Added an AllowAgentForwarding option to sshd\_config(8) to control
whether authentication agent forwarding is permitted. Note that this
is a loose control, as a client may install their own unofficial
forwarder.
\* ssh(1) and sshd(8): avoid unnecessary malloc/copy/free when receiving
network data, resulting in a ~10% speedup
\* ssh(1) and sshd(8) will now try additional addresses when connecting
to a port forward destination whose DNS name resolves to more than
one address. The previous behaviour was to try the only first address
and give up if that failed. (bz#383)
\* ssh(1) and sshd(8) now support signalling that channels are
half-closed for writing, through a channel protocol extension
notification "eow@openssh.com". This allows propagation of closed
file descriptors, so that commands such as:
"ssh -2 localhost od /bin/ls | true"
do not send unnecessary data over the wire. (bz#85)
\* sshd(8): increased the default size of ssh protocol 1 ephemeral keys
from 768 to 1024 bits.
\* When ssh(1) has been requested to fork after authentication
("ssh -f") with ExitOnForwardFailure enabled, delay the fork until
after replies for any -R forwards have been seen. Allows for robust
detection of -R forward failure when using -f. (bz#92)
\* "Match group" blocks in sshd\_config(5) now support negation of
groups. E.g. "Match group staff,!guests" (bz#1315)
\* sftp(1) and sftp-server(8) now allow chmod-like operations to set
set[ug]id/sticky bits. (bz#1310)
\* The MaxAuthTries option is now permitted in sshd\_config(5) match
blocks.
\* Multiplexed ssh(1) sessions now support a subset of the ~ escapes
that are available to a primary connection. (bz#1331)
\* ssh(1) connection multiplexing will now fall back to creating a new
connection in most error cases. (bz#1439 bz#1329)
\* Added some basic interoperability tests against Twisted Conch.
\* Documented OpenSSH's extensions to and deviations from the published
SSH protocols (the PROTOCOL file in the distribution)
\* Documented OpenSSH's ssh-agent protocol (PROTOCOL.agent).
Bug and documentation fixes
\* Make ssh(1) deal more gracefully with channel requests that fail.
Previously it would optimistically assume that requests would always
succeed, which could cause hangs if they did not (e.g. when the
server runs out of file descriptors). (bz#1384)
\* ssh(1) now reports multiplexing errors via the multiplex slave's
stderr where possible (subject to LogLevel in the mux master).
\* ssh(1) and sshd(8) now send terminate protocol banners with CR+LF for
protocol 2 to comply with RFC 4253. Previously they were terminated
with CR alone. Protocol 1 banners remain CR terminated. (bz#1443)
\* Merged duplicate authentication file checks in sshd(8) and refuse to
read authorised\_keys and .shosts from non-regular files. (bz#1438)
\* Ensure that sshd(8)'s umask disallows at least group and world write,
even if a more permissive one has been inherited. (bz#1433)
\* Suppress the warning message from sshd(8) when changing to a
non-existent user home directory after chrooting. (bz#1461)
\* Mention that scp(1) follows symlinks when performing recursive
copies. (bz#1466)
\* Prevent sshd(8) from erroneously applying public key restrictions
leaned from ~/.ssh/authorized\_keys to other authentication methods
when public key authentication subsequently fails. (bz#1472)
\* Fix protocol keepalive timeouts - in some cases, keepalive packets
were being sent, but the connection was not being closed when the
limit for missing replies was exceeded. (bz#1465)
\* Fix ssh(1) sending invalid TTY modes when a TTY was forced (ssh -tt)
but stdin was not a TTY. (bz#1199)
\* ssh(1) will now exit with a non-zero exit status if
ExitOnForwardFailure was set and forwardings were disabled due to a
failed host key check.
\* Fix MaxAuthTries tests to disallow a free authentication try to
clients that skipped the protocol 2 "none" authentication method.
(part of bz#1432)
\* Make keepalive timeouts apply while synchronously waiting
for a packet, particularly during key renegotiation. (bz#1363)
\* sshd(8) has been audited to eliminate fd leaks and calls to fatal()
in conditions of file descriptor exhaustion.
Portable OpenSSH-specific bugfixes
\* Avoid a sshd(8) hang-on-exit on Solaris caused by depending on the
success of isatty() on a PTY master (undefined behaviour). Probably
affected other platforms too. (bz#1463)
\* Fixed test for locked accounts on HP/UX with shadowed
passwords disabled. (bz#1083)
\* Disable poll() fallback in atomiciov for Tru64. readv
doesn't seem to be a comparable object there, which lead to
compilation errors. (bz#1386)
\* Fall back to racy rename if link returns EXDEV. (bz#1447)
\* Explicitly handle EWOULDBLOCK wherever we handle EAGAIN, on
some platforms (HP nonstop) it is a distinct errno. (bz#1467)
\* Avoid NULL dereferences in ancient sigaction replacement
code. (bz#1240)
\* Avoid linking against libgssapi, which despite its name
doesn't seem to implement all of GSSAPI. (bz#1276)
\* Use explicit noreturn attribute instead of \_\_dead, fixing
compilation problems on Interix. (bz#1112)
