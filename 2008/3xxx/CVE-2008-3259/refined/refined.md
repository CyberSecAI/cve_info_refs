**CVE-2008-1483**

While the document doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2008-3259, it does refer to CVE-2008-1483 in the context of a fix in OpenSSH 5.0. This CVE describes an X11 hijacking vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that some operating systems (specifically HP-UX) do not perform checks to ensure that when binding to a port previously bound with `SO_REUSEADDR`, the effective user-ID matches the previous bind or that the bind addresses do not overlap.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of socket binding with `SO_REUSEADDR`.
- The `sshd_config(5)` option `X11UseLocalhost` set to "no" creates a window for an attack by allowing a more specific bind that takes precedence over the `sshd` wildcard listener.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle attack on X11 connections. An attacker can hijack X11 forwarding.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Attacker needs to be on the same network or have a man-in-the-middle position.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a more specific bind to the X11 port than sshd.
- The server must be running on a vulnerable OS (like HP-UX).
- `X11UseLocalhost` needs to be set to "no" in `sshd_config`.

**Additional notes:**
- Modern BSD systems, Linux, OS X and Solaris are not vulnerable due to proper checks during the binding process.
- Portable OpenSSH 5.1 addressed the issue by not setting `SO_REUSEADDR` when `X11UseLocalhost` is set to no.
