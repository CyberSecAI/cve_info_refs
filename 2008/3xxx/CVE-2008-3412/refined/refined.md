Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3412:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability in the EPShop application. Specifically, the `pid` parameter is not properly sanitized when used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `pid` parameter in the `pro_show` and `disppro` actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full database compromise: An attacker can use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to extract sensitive data (usernames, passwords), modify data, or even gain full control of the database.
- Full server compromise: By leveraging SQL injection, attackers can in some cases gain code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable pages. Specifically, the `pid` parameter within the URL can be modified to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via network access. No prior authentication or access to the server is needed.
- Basic HTTP request knowledge: The attacker needs to know how to construct HTTP GET requests, especially how to modify URL parameters to inject SQL code.
