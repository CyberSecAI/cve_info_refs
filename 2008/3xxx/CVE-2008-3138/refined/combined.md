How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## wnpa-sec-2008-03 · Multiple problems in Wireshark

## Summary

**Name:** Multiple problems in Wireshark

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2008-03

**Date:** June 30, 2008

**Affected versions:** 0.9.5 up to and including 1.0.0

**Fixed versions:** 1.0.1

## Details

### Description

Wireshark 1.0.1 fixes the following vulnerabilities:

* The GSM SMS dissector could crash.

  Versions affected: 0.99.2 to 1.0.0

  * The PANA and KISMET dissectors could force Wireshark to quit
    unexpectedly.

    (Bug )

    Versions affected: 0.99.3 to 1.0.0

    * The RTMPT dissector could crash.

      (Bug )

      Versions affected: 0.99.8 to 1.0.0

      * The RMI dissector could disclose system memory. Discovered by Noam Rathaus.

        Versions affected: 0.9.5 to 1.0.0

        * The syslog dissector could crash.

          (Bug )

          Versions affected: 1.0.0

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark crashby injecting a purposefully malformed
packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace
file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.0.1 or later.

If are running Wireshark 1.0.0 or earlier (including Ethereal 0.99.0 or earlier)
and cannot upgrade, you can work around each of the problems listed above by
doing the following:

* Disable the GSM SMS, PANA, KISMET, RTMPT, and RMI dissectors:
  + Select *Analyze→Enabled Protocols...* from the menu.+ Make sure "GSM SMS," "PANA," "Kismet," "RTMPT," and "RMI" are un-checked.+ Click "Save", then click "OK".

wireshark security update (RHSA-2008-0890)

Original Release Date: October 8, 2008

Last Revised: May 12, 2009

Number: ASA-2008-392

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Wireshark is a program for monitoring network traffic. Wireshark was
previously known as Ethereal.

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in Wireshark. If Wireshark read
a malformed packet off a network, it could crash or, possibly, execute
arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3146](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3146) to this issue.

Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
opened a malformed dump file.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2008-1070](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1070), [CVE-2008-1071](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1071), [CVE-2008-1072](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1072), [CVE-2008-1561](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1561), [CVE-2008-1562](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1562), [CVE-2008-1563](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1563), [CVE-2008-3137](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3137), [CVE-2008-3138](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3138), [CVE-2008-3141](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3141), [CVE-2008-3145](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3145), [CVE-2008-3932](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3932), [CVE-2008-3933](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3933) and [CVE-2008-3934](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3934) to these issues.

Additionally, this update changes the default Pluggable Authentication
Modules (PAM) configuration to always prompt for the root password before
each start of Wireshark. This avoids unintentionally running Wireshark with
root privileges.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0890.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with wireshark installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | 5.1.x and earlier | Low | Upgrade to CM 5.2 or later. |
| Avaya SIP Enablement Services | 5.1 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to SES 5.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all vulnerable system products,
Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as the system can be upgraded.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Wireshark: Denial of service — GLSA **200808-04**

Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities have been discovered in
Wireshark.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/wireshark** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.2** |

### Background

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer with a graphical front-end.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities related to memory management were discovered
in the GSM SMS dissector (CVE-2008-3137), the PANA and KISMET
dissectors (CVE-2008-3138), the RTMPT dissector (CVE-2008-3139), the
syslog dissector (CVE-2008-3140) and the RMI dissector (CVE-2008-3141)
and when reassembling fragmented packets (CVE-2008-3145).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a
specially crafted packet on a network being monitored by Wireshark or
enticing a user to read a malformed packet trace file, causing a Denial
of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Wireshark users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/wireshark-1.0.2"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

ctrl-v. (CVE-2007-6389)
Updates have been released for openSUSE 10.3, other distributions
were not affected.
- MySQL security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix a security problem:
CVE-2008-2079: MySQL allowed local users to bypass certain privilege
checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1)
DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within
the MySQL home data directory, which can point to tables that are
created in the future.
CVE-2006-7232: sql\_select.cc in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.32 and 5.1.x
before 5.1.14 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA
table, as originally demonstrated using ORDER BY.
MySQL was updated on all SUSE Linux distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
