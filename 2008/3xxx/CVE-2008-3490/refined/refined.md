Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3490

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `mail_id` parameter within the `members/mail.php` script. Specifically, the application directly uses the `mail_id` parameter in an SQL query without validating or escaping it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `mail_id` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data, including user credentials (usernames and passwords), from the database by using `UNION SELECT` to extract data from other tables (e.g., the `admin` table).
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** Although not explicitly mentioned, a successful SQL injection attack could also lead to data modification or deletion.
- **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Exploitation can lead to partial loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack is conducted remotely through HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the dating application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `members/mail.php` at line 151:
  ```php
  $result=mysql_query("select * from mail where UserTo='$username' and mail_id=$mail_id") or die ("cant do it");
  ```
- The exploit uses a crafted URL:
  ```
  http://host/members/mail.php?action=veiw&mail_id=-1 union select 1,2,3,concat(username,0x3a,password),5,6,7 from admin/*
  ```
  This URL injects a SQL `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `admin` table, specifically concatenating the username and password.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is found in E-topbiz Dating 3 PHP Script version 1.0 and 3.0.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
- The CVSS base score is 6.5, with an exploitability subscore of 8.0, indicating relatively easy exploitation.
- The provided exploit details how an attacker can extract the admin username and password.
