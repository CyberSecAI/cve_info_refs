         "vulnerability": "The specific flaw exists in the GetVMArgsOption() function used while parsing the java-vm-args attribute of the j2se tag in xml based JNLP files. When a user downloads a malicious JNLP file, the vulnerable attribute is read into a static buffer. If an overly long value is defined by the java-vm-args attribute, a stack based buffer overflow occurs, resulting in an exploitable condition.",
