    "URL": "www.exploit-db.com_3b027e84_20250125_121728.html",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies within the Ultra Office ActiveX control, specifically in how it handles file saving after opening a remote URL.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The ActiveX control allows arbitrary file saving to the local system.",
      "The control does not properly validate the save path, allowing overwriting of critical files.",
       "The control can be triggered remotely through a website with malicious code."
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary file corruption or denial of service by overwriting system files.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious website can embed the vulnerable ActiveX control and execute a script to download a file and overwrite a local system file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website or inject the exploit code into a website visited by the target. The attacker does not require authentication."

     "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists in the Ultra Office ActiveX control which allows remote arbitrary file corruption due to improper handling of file saving.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure ActiveX control implementation.",
      "Lack of proper path validation when saving a file.",
      "Ability to save a file to an arbitrary location on the system."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote arbitrary file corruption, potentially leading to system instability or compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploited remotely via a webpage that embeds and invokes the vulnerable ActiveX control.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to convince victim to visit a webpage containing the malicious code. No authentication is required. "
