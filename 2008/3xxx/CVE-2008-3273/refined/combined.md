## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0828)

## Topic

Updated JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) packages that fix
various security issues are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

JBoss EAP is a middleware platform for Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition
(J2EE) applications.

This release of JBoss EAP for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 contains the JBoss
Application Server and JBoss Seam. This release serves as a replacement to
JBoss EAP 4.3.0.GA, and fixes the following security issues:

The JavaServer Faces (JSF) component was vulnerable to multiple cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. An attacker could use these flaws to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML. (CVE-2008-1285)

Unauthenticated users were able to access the status servlet, which could
allow remote attackers to acquire details about deployed web contexts.
(CVE-2008-3273)

These updated packages include bug fixes and enhancements which are not
listed here. For a full list, refer to the JBoss EAP 4.3.0.CP01 release
notes, linked to in the "References" section of this advisory.

Warning: before applying this update, please back up the JBoss EAP
"server/[configuration]/deploy/" directory, and any customized
configuration files.

All users of JBoss EAP on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 are advised to upgrade
to these updated packages, which resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
