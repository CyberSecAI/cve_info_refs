cups security update (RHSA-2008-0937)

Original Release Date: December 9, 2008

Last Revised: December 9, 2008

Number: ASA-2008-470

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
for UNIX(R) operating systems.

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the SGI image format decoding
routines used by the CUPS image converting filter "imagetops". An attacker
could create a malicious SGI image file that could, possibly, execute
arbitrary code as the "lp" user if the file was printed. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2008-3639](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3639) to this issue.

An integer overflow flaw leading to a heap buffer overflow was discovered
in the Text-to-PostScript "texttops" filter. An attacker could create a
malicious text file that could, possibly, execute arbitrary code as the
"lp" user if the file was printed. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2008-3640](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3640) to this issue.

An insufficient buffer bounds checking flaw was discovered in the
HP-GL/2-to-PostScript "hpgltops" filter. An attacker could create a
malicious HP-GL/2 file that could, possibly, execute arbitrary code as the
"lp" user if the file was printed. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2008-3641](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3641) to this issue.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- imlib2
A security problem was fixed in imlib2 where loading a specific XPM
file could corrupt memory. (CVE-2008-5187)
Affected products: SLED 10 SP2, SLE SDK 10 (updates for other products
were already released)
- valgrind
valgrind reads a file .valgrindrc in the current directory.
Therefore local users could place such a file a world writable
directory such as /tmp and influence other users' valgrind when it's
executed there (CVE-2008-4865).
Affected products: SLES9/SDK (updates for other products were already
released)
- kvm
Rogue VNC clients could make the built in VNC server of kvm run into
an infinite loop (CVE-2008-2382)
An off-by-one bug limited the length of VNC passwords to seven
instead of eight (CVE-2008-5714)
Virtualized guests could potentially execute code on the host by
triggering a buffer overflow in the network emulation code via large
ethernet frames (CVE-2007-5729)
Virtualized guests could potentially execute code on the host by
triggering a heap based buffer overflow in the Cirrus Graphics card
emulation (CVE-2007-1320).
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- cups
Previous updates for the PNG and HPGL filters were incomplete and
are corrected now (CVE-2008-3641, CVE-2008-5286).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3, 11.0, SLE10-SP2, SLES9
- lynx
This update of lynx fixes two security bugs:
- untrusted search path allows execution of arbitrary commands via
.mailcap or mime.types file (CVE-2006-7234)
- when advanced mode is enabled and lynx is used as URL handler, remote
attackers can execute arbitrary commands (CVE-2008-4690)
Affected products: NLD 9 SDK, SLE SDK 10 SP2, SLES SDK 9 (updates for
other products were already released)
- xterm
XTerm evaluated various ANSI Escape sequences so that command execution
was possible if an attacker could pipe raw data to an xterm.
(CVE-2008-2383)
(It is usually not recommended to display raw data on an xterm.)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLE10-SP2, (SLES9 packages will
be released within this week)

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

  Impact: Systems that have been manually configured to use rlogin and host.equiv may unexpectedly permit root login

  Description: The manpage for the configuration file hosts.equiv indicates that entries do not apply to root. However, an implementation issue in rlogind causes these entries to also apply to root. This update addresses the issue by properly disallowing rlogin from the root user if the remote system is in hosts.equiv. The rlogin service is not enabled by default in Mac OS X, and must be manually configured in order to be enabled. Credit to Ralf Meyer for reporting this issue.

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds:
none
3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- cups
Specially crafted print jobs could trigger buffer overflows in the
'imagetops', 'texttops' and 'hpgltops' filters. Attackers could
potentially exploit that to execute arbitrary code on the cups
server (CVE-2008-3639, CVE-2008-3640, CVE-2008-3641).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-11.0, SLED 10 SP1,SLED 10 SP2,
SLES 10 SP1,SLES 10 SP2,SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8 for IBM
S/390 and IBM zSeries,SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8 for x86,
Novell Linux Desktop 9,Novell Linux POS 9,Open Enterprise Server,SLES 9
- hplip,hplip-hpijs,hplip17,hplip17-hpijs
hplip was updated because it does allow to send alert mails as user
(CVE-2008-2940) and was affected by a denial-of-service bug
(CVE-2008-2941).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-10.3,SLED 10 SP1,SLED 10 SP2,SLES 10 SP1,
SLES 10 SP2
- apache2-mod\_php5,php5\*
The current update of apache2-mod\_php5 fixes some overflows in the
gd extension and in the memnstr() function that could crash php or
possibly allow remote code execution (CVE-2008-3658, CVE-2008-3659)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-11.0 (previously released), SLE SDK 10
SP1,SLES 10 SP1
- openldap2
This update fixes a security problem in the liblber client library of
openldap that allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(program termination) via crafted ASN.1 BER datagrams, which triggers
an assertion error. (CVE-2008-2952)
Additionally a bug was fixed in ldap\_free\_connection which could result
in client crashes when the server closed a connection while an operation
is active.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-11.0, Novell Linux Desktop 9, Novell
Linux POS 9,Open Enterprise Server,SLE 10 DEBUGINFO SP2,SLE SDK 10 SP1,
SLE SDK 10 SP2,SLED 10 SP1,SLED 10 SP2,SLES 10 SP1,SLES 10 SP2,SLES 9,

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

### Background

CUPS is the Common Unix Printing System.

### Description

Several buffer overflows were found in:

* The read\_rle16 function in imagetops (CVE-2008-3639, found by
  regenrecht, reported via ZDI)
* The WriteProlog function in texttops (CVE-2008-3640, found by
  regenrecht, reported via ZDI)
* The Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language (HPGL) filter (CVE-2008-3641,
  found by regenrecht, reported via iDefense)
* The \_cupsImageReadPNG function (CVE-2008-5286, reported by iljavs)

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted input to a vulnerable
server, resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the server.

### Workaround

None this time.

### Resolution

All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version.

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/cups-1.3.9-r1"
```

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0937)

## Topic

Updated cups packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
for UNIX(R) operating systems.

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the SGI image format decoding
routines used by the CUPS image converting filter "imagetops". An attacker
could create a malicious SGI image file that could, possibly, execute
arbitrary code as the "lp" user if the file was printed. (CVE-2008-3639)

An integer overflow flaw leading to a heap buffer overflow was discovered
in the Text-to-PostScript "texttops" filter. An attacker could create a
malicious text file that could, possibly, execute arbitrary code as the
"lp" user if the file was printed. (CVE-2008-3640)

An insufficient buffer bounds checking flaw was discovered in the
HP-GL/2-to-PostScript "hpgltops" filter. An attacker could create a
malicious HP-GL/2 file that could, possibly, execute arbitrary code as the
"lp" user if the file was printed. (CVE-2008-3641)

Red Hat would like to thank regenrecht for reporting these issues.

All CUPS users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
