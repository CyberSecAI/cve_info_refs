| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=455455#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-07-15 15:58:35 UTC  ``` Jan Minar's test suite [1] for multiple vim vulnerabilities uncovered an old vim bug that could trigger a heap buffer overflow in mch_expand_wildcards() in os_unix.c when file or directory with specially crafted name is opened in vim.    [1] <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.tar.bz2>  Issue is caused by incorrect computation of memory requirements for buffer to store external command executed by vim.  File / directory name is escaped / quoted before being passed to an external command, however, possible quoting is not taken into account when allocating memory.  Issue was introduced in 6.2.429:   <http://vim.cvs.sourceforge.net/vim/vim/src/os_unix.c?view=log#rev1.104>   ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/6.2.429  and fixed upstream in 6.3.059:   <http://vim.cvs.sourceforge.net/vim/vim/src/os_unix.c?view=log#rev1.111>   ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/6.3/6.3.059  and later re-written for vim 7.0 to use backslash escaping instead of quoting:   <http://vim.cvs.sourceforge.net/vim/vim7/src/os_unix.c?r1=1.49&r2=1.50>  For further details, see:   <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/4>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=455455#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-07-15 15:59:54 UTC  ``` This issue only affects vim packages as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4, which are based on vim 6.3.046.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=455455#c3)  Red Hat Product Security    2009-01-09 08:36:36 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0617.html>   ``` |  |

  Impact: Systems that have been manually configured to use rlogin and host.equiv may unexpectedly permit root login

  Description: The manpage for the configuration file hosts.equiv indicates that entries do not apply to root. However, an implementation issue in rlogind causes these entries to also apply to root. This update addresses the issue by properly disallowing rlogin from the root user if the remote system is in hosts.equiv. The rlogin service is not enabled by default in Mac OS X, and must be manually configured in order to be enabled. Credit to Ralf Meyer for reporting this issue.

* **Script Editor**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-4214

  Description: An insecure file operation issue exists in the Script Editor application when opening application scripting dictionaries. A local user can cause the scripting dictionary to be written to an arbitrary path accessible by the user that is running the application. This update addresses the issue by creating the temporary file in a secure location. Credit: Apple.

* **Single Sign-On**

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.5, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Impact: The sso\_util command now accepts passwords from a file

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#####

##### 3. Problem Description

a. Updated OpenSSL package for the Service Console fixes a security issue.
OpenSSL 0.9.7a-33.24 and earlier does not properly check the return value from the EVP\_VerifyFinal function, which could allow a remote attacker to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature for DSA and ECDSA keys.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-5077 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

#####

b. Update bind package for the Service Console fixes a security issue.
A flaw was discovered in the way Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) checked the return value of the OpenSSL DSA\_do\_verify function. On systems using DNSSEC, a malicious zone could present a malformed DSA certificate and bypass proper certificate validation, allowing spoofing attacks.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2009-0025 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

\* hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

#####

c. Updated vim package for the Service Console addresses several security issues.
Several input flaws were found in Visual editor IMproved's (Vim) keyword and tag handling. If Vim looked up a document's maliciously crafted tag or keyword, it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4101 to this issue.
A heap-based overflow flaw was discovered in Vim's expansion of file name patterns with shell wildcards. An attacker could create a specially crafted file or directory name, when opened by Vim causes the application to stop responding or execute arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-3432 to this issue. Several input flaws were found in various Vim system functions. If a user opened a specially crafted file, it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-2712 to this issue. A format string flaw was discovered in Vim's help tag processor. If a user was tricked into executing the "helptags" command on malicious data, arbitrary code could be executed with the permissions of the user running VIM.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-2953 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

No problem.  Your inputs are really appreciated, as you obviously spent
a lot of time on researching those issues.

I believe this is already corrected in your updated test suite:

Regarding those new netrw issues:

- Issues 1 (netrw.v2) and 2 (netrw.v3) (for mz and mc commands) does not
seem to affect any stable version of vim.  Support for those commands
was only added after vim 7.1 and should only affect 7.2 alpha (and
possibly also beta, which was released this week iirc).

- Issue 3 (netrw.v4) affects netrw versions of netrw as shipped with
vim 7.0 and 7.1.  This problem does not seem to affect explorer.vim
used by vim 6.x.

Steven, are you going to split / de-dupe CVE ids based on this
information and the information in my post in other thread:

<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/2> ?

Sounds like this may be a good split, but I'm afraid I'll get stoned
for causing another CVE headache mess:
- CVE-2008-2712 - first advisory; xpm, filetype, gzip tests; affects
vim 6.0+, possibly older (not checked)
- CVE-new1 - first + second advisory; netrw and netrw.v4 tests; vim 7.0+
- CVE-new2 - first advisory; netrw test; explorer.vim on vim 6.x,
possibly older
- merged CVE-2008-3074 and CVE-2008-3075 - first + second advisroy;
tarplugin* and zipplugin tests; vim 7.0+
- CVE-new3 - second advisory; netrw.v2 and netrw.v3 tests; vim 7.2a+

Of course, this split takes into account first affected version, not
when the issue got / will get fixed.  I believe not all issues are
already fixed upstream.  Bram, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

Additionally, netrw.v3 uncovered one old bug affecting some 6.2 and 6.3
vim versions.  On affected versions, it triggers heap buffer overflow,
when vim is used to open file or directory with specially crafted name.

The problem is in the mch_expand_wildcards() in os_unix.c.  Problem was
introduced in 6.2.429:
  <http://vim.cvs.sourceforge.net/vim/vim/src/os_unix.c?view=log#rev1.104>
  ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/6.2.429

After applying this patch, following occurs:
- vim tries to run external command to perform shell expansion, to
calculate a buffer size needed to store this command, following code is
used:

  /* "unset nonomatch; print -N >" plus two is 29 */
  len = STRLEN(tempname) + 29;
  for (i = 0; i < num_pat; ++i)       /* count the length of the patterns */
      len += STRLEN(pat[i]) + 3;      /* add space and two quotes */
  command = alloc(len);

(i.e. expected command is: <some fixed length prefix> <space> <quote>
<pattern from file/directory name> <quote>, possibly with multiple
patterns).

However, later in the code, more complex quoting is used, which quotes
being added around spaces and 's, so patterns with lots of spaces can
easily trigger command buffer overflow:

    if (vim_strchr((char_u *)" '", pat[i][j]) != NULL)
    {
        *p++ = '"';
        while (pat[i][j] != NUL
                && vim_strchr((char_u *)" '", pat[i][j]) != NULL)
            *p++ = pat[i][j++];
        *p++ = '"';
    }
    else
        *p++ = pat[i][j++];

Issue was addressed upstream in:
  <http://vim.cvs.sourceforge.net/vim/vim/src/os_unix.c?view=log#rev1.111>
  ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/6.3/6.3.059

Memory requirement computation phase was updated to take this quoting
mechanism into account.  This was further re-written for vim 7.0 in:
  <http://vim.cvs.sourceforge.net/vim/vim7/src/os_unix.c?r1=1.49&r2=1.50>

Steven, can you please allocate an id for this heap corruption
affecting 6.2.429 - 6.3.059?  Thanks!

All,

My head and shoulders genuinely hurt from trying to figure this out.
Sorry for the delay.

I don't think explaining how CVEs work will help in this extremely complex
situation.

I have a number of questions, some of which are based on the newest
advisories that rdancer released...

- Steve

************************************************************************
************************************************************************
This section is about issues that don't seem to have any major
confusion.  Please confirm.
************************************************************************
************************************************************************

------------------------------------------------------------
filetype.vim not fixed

 - inconsistent regular expression usage in substitute()
   <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-filetype.vim.updated.html>

 - earlier filetype.vim issue was in CVE-2008-2712.1

 - NEEDS NEW CVE

------------------------------------------------------------
heap overflow, demonstrated by netrw.v3

    - NEW CVE assigned: CVE-2008-3432

      - vim 6.2 and 6.3 (mch_expand_wildcards)

      - <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/4>

------------------------------------------------------------
configure.in temp file issue

  - ALREADY assigned CVE: CVE-2008-3294 (see web site)

    - vim 5.0 through 7.1, maybe earlier, fixed in 7.2b.014

    - <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-configure.in.html>

------------------------------------------------------------
netrw.v5 test case

  - NEEDS NEW CVE

  - <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v5.html>

  - affected version: Netrw version 127, Vim 7.2b

  - affected file: netrw.vim

************************************************************************

------------------------------------------------------------
shellescape() implementation issue (tar):

  - Report TAR-1

    rdancer says "shellescape() does not escape all special items"
    specifically the "!" character

    - <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-shellescape.html>

    - 7.2a.013 and other versions before 7.2b.005

    - mentions tar.vim (tarplugin)

    - test case: tarplugin.v2

  - Report TAR-2

     Tomas Hoger says affects 7.0 and 7.1:

     <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/2>

  - Report TAR-3

     assignment of CVE-2008-3074 to "tarplugin"

	 <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/10/7>

	 - already used by rPath in advisory

  - Report TAR-4

     rdancer tar.vim issue

	   <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html>

  - Report TAR-5

    rdancer says tar.vim test was omitted from Makefile

	<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/13/1>

1) Are TAR-1, TAR-2, TAR-3, and TAR-4 all talking about the same
   issue?  If not - which ones are the same?

2) Since tar.vim doesn't affect 6.x, it should stay SPLIT from
   CVE-2008-2712.

------------------------------------------------------------
zip.vim

  - Report ZIP-1

    rdancer says "zip.vim" as well as "zipPlugin.vim"

    - <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html>

	- Vim 7.1.298 and 6.4

	- *part* of the advisory used CVE-2008-2712, but CVE-2008-2712
       didn't include it

  - Report ZIP-2

    Tomas Hoger suggests "still unfixed"

	   <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/10/7>

    - CVE-2008-3075 assigned; used by rPath

	- since CVE-2008-2712 issues were fixed and zip.vim remains
      unfixed, a SPLIT from CVE-2008-2712 is reasonable

  - Report ZIP-3

    Tomas Hoger says "only 7.0 and 7.1" affected

	  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/2>

  - Report ZIP-4

    rdancer says zip "has not been fixed as of Vim 7.2a.19/zip.vim
    v19"

	  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/13/1>

  - Report ZIP-5

    CVE-2008-2712 bullet (2) mentions zipplugin based on same advisory
    as ZIP-1:

	<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2712>

1) Are ZIP-1, ZIP-2, ZIP-3, and ZIP-4 all talking about the same
   issue?

2) What differences, if any, are there in zip.vim and zipplugin.vim?

3) Given the varying results for TAR-1 through TAR-4, should zip.vim
   be split from the tar issues?  What about zipplugin.vim?

4) It might be reasonable to remove item (2) from CVE-2008-2712.

------------------------------------------------------------
Looking at netrw.v2:

  - Report NETRW2-a

    rdancer says "mx" and "mz" in:
    <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.html>

	NO version information provided in this advisory, but title
	indicates "Netrw version 125, Vim 7.2a.10"

  - Report NETRW2-b

    Tomas Hoger mentions "mz and mc" in:
    <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/4>

	but: mc is probably referring to netrw.v3, so not relevant here

	mz "should only affect 7.2 alpha"

  - Report NETRW2-c

  - rdancer says "mf" (section 3.1) and "mz" (section 3.2) in:
    <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v2.html>

	but then, rdancer also gives an example for "mx" (3.2.1)

	versions: 7.2a.10, Netrw version 125.

1) What role, if any, does "mf" play (NETRW2-c)?  It's listed as a
   "prerequisite" then nothing else is said.  Does it have a
   vulnerability?  Or does the victim need to mark a file before
   decompressing it?

2) "mx" doesn't use quoting in section 3.2.1 (NETRW2-a), so does it
   have a vulnerability too?

3) Which combination of mx, mz, and mf is really being covered by
   the netrw.v2 test case?

------------------------------------------------------------
Looking at netrw.v3:

  - Report NETRW3-a

    rdancer says "mc" shellescape issues in:
    <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.html>

	- missing use of shellescape for "args" variable in mc command

  - Report NETRW3-b

    Tomas Hoger mentions "mz and mc" in:
    <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/4>

	but: mz is probably referring to netrw.v2, so not relevant here

	- mc "should only affect 7.2 alpha"

  - Report NETRW3-c

    Tomas Hoger says heap overflow (not mentioned in rdancer)
    <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/4>

  - Report NETRW3-d

    rdancer says netrw.v3 is "vulnerable" in an advisory about
    netrw.v5:

	   <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v5.html>

    version: Vim 7.2b

1) NETRW3-c is clearly different, so CVE-2008-3432 is assigned.

2) Are NETRW3-a and NETRW3-b talking about the same issue?

3) What is the relationship between NETRW3-b and NETRW3-d?  The
   version numbers conflict.

4) Because of item 3, I'm tempted to split netrw.v3.

5) In NETRW3-a, rdancer says there are "many places" but only
   emphasizes the "args" part

   a) why does the patch only address one issue?

   b) the other quoted examples seem to use shellescape().  Are these
   vulnerable too?

------------------------------------------------------------
Looking at netrw.v4:

  - Report NETRW4-a

    shellescape issues in the "D" command for deleting files
    <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.html>

	NO version information provided in this advisory, but title
	indicates "Netrw version 125, Vim 7.2a.10"

  - Report NETRW4-b

    Tomas Hoger says netrw.v4 affects 7.0 and 7.1
	<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/4>

    - DOES NOT affect explorer.vim in 6.x

1) Why does NETRW4-a mention "function s:NetrwLocalRmFile()" twice?

2) Why does NETRW4-a point to lots of examples where "shellescape" is
   used?

3) Is appears that NETRW4-b remains unfixed according to NETRW4-a, is
   that right?

------------------------------------------------------------
Looking at netrw explorer.vim plugin:

  - Report EXP-1

    "netrw" test case triggers "similar problem" in explorer.vim:

	<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/2>

	- in vim 6.x

  - Report EXP-2

    "netrw.v4" test case does not affect explorer.vim

1) Does this need a separate ID?  If not, which does it belong with?

vim security update (RHSA-2008-0617)

Original Release Date: January 5, 2009

Last Revised: June 5, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-001

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Vim (Visual editor IMproved) is an updated and improved version of
the vi
editor.

Several input sanitization flaws were found in Vim's keyword and tag
handling. If Vim looked up a document's maliciously crafted tag or
keyword,
it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name [CVE-2008-4101](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4101) to this issue.

A heap-based overflow flaw was discovered in Vim's expansion of file
name
patterns with shell wildcards. An attacker could create a
specially-crafted
file or directory name that, when opened by Vim, caused the application
to
crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2008-3432](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3432) to this issue.

Several input sanitization flaws were found in various Vim system
functions. If a user opened a specially crafted file, it was possible to
execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name
[CVE-2008-2712](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2712) to this issue.

A format string flaw was discovered in
Vim's help tag processor. If a user was tricked into executing the
"helptags" command on malicious data, arbitrary code could be executed
with
the permissions of the user running Vim. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-2953](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2953) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0617.html>

Avaya has rated this as a Low risk level as either the package is
installed but not used by any application or exploitation would require
direct non-standard user interaction.

enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.
