Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-3756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability found in the `viralmarketing.php` script of YourFreeWorld Viral Marketing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The script is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `id` parameter in the `tr.php` file. It does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords stored in the `adminsettings` table.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `tr.php` script with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the injection payload.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit payload is:
    ```
    tr.php?id=-1+union+select+1,2,3,concat(0x3a,Username,0x3a,Password),5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13+from+adminsettings--
    ```
    This payload uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `adminsettings` table, concatenating the `Username` and `Password` fields.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Exploit-DB entry provides a working demo URL, highlighting the ease of exploitation.
*   The vulnerability is in the `tr.php` file, which takes an `id` parameter.
*   The `concat(0x3a,Username,0x3a,Password)` part of the payload is used to retrieve the username and password from database with colon separators.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication and potentially gain administrative access by exploiting SQL injection to retrieve admin credentials.
