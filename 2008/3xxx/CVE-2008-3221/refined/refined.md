Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2008-3221:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to adequately protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks in Drupal 6.x versions prior to 6.3

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper CSRF protection, specifically within the functionality related to the deletion of OpenID identities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Administrative Actions:** An attacker can potentially perform administrative actions, specifically the deletion of OpenID identities, on behalf of a logged-in user, without the user's knowledge or consent.

**Attack vectors:**
- **CSRF:** The attack vector involves tricking a logged-in user into unintentionally submitting a crafted request to the vulnerable Drupal instance. This could involve the use of malicious links or web pages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request. They need to know the structure of the request required to delete an OpenID identity.
- The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user to trigger the malicious request, for instance via a malicious link or website.
