{
  "CVE-2008-3528": {
    "Description": "The ext[234] filesystem code fails to properly handle corrupted data structures. With a mounted filesystem image or partition that have corrupted dir->i_size and dir->i_blocks, a user performing either a read or write operation on the mounted image or partition can lead to a possible denial of service by spamming the logfile.",
    "Root cause": "The ext[234] filesystem code fails to properly handle corrupted data structures, specifically corrupted dir->i_size and dir->i_blocks values.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of corrupted data structures",
      "Lack of input validation of filesystem metadata"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to log file spamming. System hangs may also occur.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local attacker with the ability to mount filesystems",
      "Mounting a specially crafted filesystem"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to mount a crafted filesystem image or partition."
  }
