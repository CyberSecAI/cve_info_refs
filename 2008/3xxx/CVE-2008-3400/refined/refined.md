Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2008-3400:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically within the `$include_directory` variable in the `activities/workflow-activities.php` file of XRms version 1.99.2. Additionally, there are other vulnerabilities related to the `$msg` variable in multiple files which leads to XSS and a phpinfo() call in the `tests/info.php` file leads to Information Gathering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The vulnerable `$include_directory` variable allows for the inclusion of remote files. This is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `$msg` variable in multiple files allows for the injection of malicious script into web pages viewed by other users. This is due to inadequate output encoding and input sanitization.
3.  **Information Disclosure:** The `tests/info.php` file contains a `phpinfo()` call that exposes potentially sensitive information about the server environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **RFI:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the website, leading to a range of attacks, such as session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, or stealing sensitive user information.
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could leverage information about server configuration from the phpinfo() call to further exploit the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **RFI:**  By crafting a request with a malicious URL in the `$include_directory` parameter.
*   **XSS:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code in the `$msg` parameter
*   **Information Gathering:** By directly accessing the `tests/info.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable XRms web application.
*   For RFI, the attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on an accessible server.
*   For XSS, the attacker needs to craft a specific malicious payload and inject it via the `$msg` variable.
*   For Information Gathering, the attacker needs to be able to access the `/tests/info.php` file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The RFI vulnerability requires the `register_globals` PHP setting to be enabled.
*   The XSS vulnerability has quote limitations, which may make exploitation more complex.
