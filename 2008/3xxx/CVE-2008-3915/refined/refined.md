  "cve": "CVE-2008-3915",
  "description": "Johann Dahm and David Richter reported and issue in the nfsd subsystem that may allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a buffer overflow.",
  "affected_software": [
    {
      "name": "Linux Kernel",
      "versions": [
        "2.6.24"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the nfsd subsystem when handling NFSv4 ACLs. The `init_state()` function allocates an array that is not large enough to hold the decoded ACL data, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient buffer allocation.",
       "Improper input validation."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending specially crafted NFSv4 requests containing malicious Access Control Lists (ACLs) that trigger the buffer overflow, leading to a system crash.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote exploitation via network traffic. The attacker needs to send a specially crafted NFSv4 request with a malicious ACL.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to a server where NFSv4 is enabled.",
      "position": "Remote attacker."
