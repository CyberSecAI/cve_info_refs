# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

#### Topic: PunBB 1.2.20 and 1.3RC hotfix released

PunBB 1.2.20 and 1.3RC hotfix released today.

The XSS via the "p" GET parameter is fixed. Reported by [Henry Sudhof](http://www.phpbb.com/about/team/#guid163699-4).

The proof of concept:

```
userlist.php?p=2<script>alert('meh');</script>
```

Clicking the link like this results in the script execution: [http://punbb.informer.com/forums/userli … /script%3E](http://punbb.informer.com/forums/userlist.php?p=2%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27meh%27);%3C/script%3E)
This XSS doesn't work *at PunBB Forums* anymore as the *hotfix* has just been released and installed. As usual, PunBB 1.3RC administrators will see an alert (as soon as they log in to the forum) and will be able to install the hotfix with several clicks.

This bug cannot be used directly in PunBB 1.2, but can appear in mods using the page number set by PunBB: check your mods for the correct page number screening.

Visit [Downloads page](http://punbb.informer.com/downloads.php) for the PunBB 1.2.20 packages and patches. Or get the latest revision from [SVN trunk](http://punbb.informer.com/svn/punbb/trunk/).

You mean you used [the 1.217 to .20 patch](http://punbb.informer.com/download/patch/punbb-1.2.17_to_1.2.20.patch). Yes, it must include all the changes: 1.2.17->.18->.19->.20.

The same idea.
Though, it would be easier to you to apply the patch, if you have many mods installed.

Try [this instruction](http://punbb.informer.com/download/patch/instructions.txt) for PunBB updates or [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_%28Unix%29) for the general idea.

Hi,

I'm sorry but I don't understand what you mean by "page number set by PunBB"
I am using some MODS so what do I need to search and change into my files ? can you be more explicit please ?

Regards.

PunBB sets the $p (page number) variable from the GET-parameters.
If one of your mods uses this $p variable, it should do it's own checks for the value or at least force this variable to be integer.

Ok thanks,

With a little soft I did a search in my MODS's files and didn't find an $p variable, but maybe I do wrong... It's easy for me to search any word or line in any folder just with one clic so tell me if **$p** is enough or if I need to search something else... Thank you for your patience

P.S : the soft I use is free, helpfull and is named **PRGrep**

Looks like it is all OK with your forum (regarding the possible issues related the forum's core).
(This is an example of where there was lack of value checks: [http://punbb.informer.com/trac/browser/ … t.php#L128](http://punbb.informer.com/trac/browser/punbb/trunk/upload/userlist.php#L128).)

Good luck.

Thanks Anatoly,

I complete my search with **$\_GET['p']** , **['p']** , **$p =**  and didn't find nothing in my MODS so it's ok for me because I remember that I did the changes ***!is\_numeric($\_GET['p']) ||*** when I updated my forum to 1.2.20

Thanks again...
