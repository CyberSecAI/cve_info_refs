Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3698:

**Vulnerability:** Local Privilege Escalation

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an issue related to the `OpenProcess` function call, leading to a privilege escalation on the host system.

**Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is an insecure use of the `OpenProcess` function, which allows a less privileged user to gain access to a higher privileged process.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local user to execute arbitrary code on the host system with elevated privileges. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have a user account on the host system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have a valid user account on the target system.
*   The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the host system.

**Affected Products and Versions**
* VMware Workstation 5.x on Windows prior to version 5.5.8 build 108000
* VMware Player 1.x on Windows prior to version 1.0.8 build 108880
* VMware ACE 1.x on Windows prior to version 1.0.7 build 108880
* VMware Server 1.x on Windows prior to version 1.0.7 build 108231

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Sun Bing from McAfee, Inc.
*   The fix involves patching the affected VMware products to prevent the insecure use of the `OpenProcess` function.
