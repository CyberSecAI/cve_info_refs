**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within an unspecified ISAPI (Internet Server Application Programming Interface) extension used by VMware Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending a specially crafted or malformed request to the vulnerable ISAPI extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No authentication is required.
- Low attack complexity

**Affected Products**
- VMware Server before 1.0.7 build 108231.

**Additional Notes:**
- The specific nature of the "malformed request" is not detailed in the provided content.
