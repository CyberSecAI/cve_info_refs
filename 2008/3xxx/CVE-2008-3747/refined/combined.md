Subject: wordpress 2.6.1

Just had a look at the wp 2.6.1 changelog.

Two security relevant bugs are listed as fixed.

<http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7359>
I'd consider this worth a CVE. It's good that this ssl stuff got some
attention lately (I think this is a similar issue to the recently reported
cookie / secureflag issues, as it can undermine the sniffing-safety of
ssl-enabled pages).

<http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6871>

AFAICS this enables one to hide malicious plugins but is no real vuln. Not
sure if it deserves a CVE.

It's hard to read into this one since I don't know what they mean by
"SSL-aware" here, or what apply_filters() is intended to do.

Use CVE-2008-3747, to be filled in later.

Presumably, only the admin would be able to install plugins.  So plugin
"hiding" isn't feasible.  The admin knows which plugins were installed,
unless there's some other exploit that installs the plugins, in which case
there's a different vuln.  So I don't think this deserves a CVE either.
