Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `get_edit_post_link()` and `get_edit_comment_link()` functions in WordPress not utilizing SSL (HTTPS) when they should. These functions are responsible for generating URLs to edit posts and comments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the failure of these functions to check if the current request is over SSL. Consequently, even if a user is accessing the WordPress admin panel via HTTPS, the edit links generated by these functions might be using HTTP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
This vulnerability undermines the security provided by SSL. By forcing edit links to use HTTP in an HTTPS session, it is possible for an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, potentially intercepting the insecure edit links over HTTP which could lead to session hijacking or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
A man-in-the-middle attacker positioned on the network can intercept the HTTP requests when a user clicks an insecurely generated edit link over an HTTPS session. The attacker can then potentially modify or view the data sent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the user and the server to intercept HTTP traffic (e.g., on a shared Wi-Fi network or compromised network infrastructure). The attacker has to be able to sniff network traffic.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was resolved in WordPress version 2.6.1.
- The fix involved making these functions "SSL-aware".
- The vulnerability is similar to other cookie/secureflag issues that undermine the safety of SSL enabled pages.
- A patch for the vulnerability is available.
