Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3972:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A too strict check in the "pkcs15-tool -T" of OpenSC 0.11.5, specifically the requirement for a card label to match "OpenSC" during smart card testing and updating, lead to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The overly restrictive label check in `pkcs15-tool -T` allowed for bypassing PIN protection mechanisms.
- Inadequate protection of PIN changing function, allowing any user to change the PIN without proper authorization (PIN, PUK, or superuser credentials).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could change a user's PIN on their smart card without knowing the original PIN, PUK, or superuser credentials.
- While the PIN could be changed, it could not be extracted or revealed using this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `pkcs15-tool -T` command.
- Physical access to the smart card is likely required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs physical access to the smart card and the ability to run the `pkcs15-tool -T` command.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in OpenSC 0.11.5 and fixed in a later update (OpenSC 0.11.6)
- The `pkcs15-tool -T` was introduced for testing and updating smart cards.
- The vulnerability could not be used to extract the PIN, but only change it.
- If the PIN on a card is still the same, it can be inferred that the vulnerability was not exploited on that particular card.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jean-Pierre Szikora.
- SUSE also included this CVE in their security summary report SUSE-SR:2008:019.
