1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- imlib2
Specially crafted xpm files could trigger a stack based buffer overflow
in imlib2 which could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2008-2426).
- mono
A bug in the ASP.net class library of mono allowed cross site
scripting attacks (CVE-2008-3422).
- tomcat5
Tomcat was updated to fix a cross site scripting issue and directory traversal
problems (CVE-2008-1232, CVE-2008-2370, CVE-2008-2938)
- libtiff
Specially crafted lzw files could trigger a buffer underflow in
libtiff (CVE-2008-2327).
- libxml2
Specially crafted xml files could cause a crash or a heap based
buffer overlow in libxml2 (CVE-2008-3281, CVE-2008-3529).
- clamav
Clamav has been updated to version 0.94. It fixes numerous problems
including some security relevant ones (CVE-2008-3912, CVE-2008-1389,
CVE-2008-3913, CVE-2008-3914).
This new version changed the library version number once again so
dependent packages had do be updated as well (clamav,
sylpheed-claws, claws-mail).
- emacs
When editing Python files Emacs accidently imported other Python
script in the current directory (CVE-2008-3949).
- php5
php5 has been updated to fix some overflows in the gd extension and
the memnstr() function that could crash php or even cause a buffer
overflow (CVE-2008-3658, CVE-2008-3659 and CVE-2008-3660)
- uvcvideo
The kernel driver uvcvideo was vulnerable to a buffer overflow in
format descriptor parsing code (CVE-2008-3496).
- postfix
When exectuting external programs postfix didn't close the file
descriptor of the epoll system call. This could potentially be
exploited to shutdown postfix (CVE-2008-3889).

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:

## Vulnerability in Emacs python integration

---

| **From**: | Chong Yidong |
| --- | --- |

| **Subject**: | Vulnerability in Emacs python integration |
| **Date**: | Fri, 05 Sep 2008 13:16:38 -0400 |
| **User-agent**: | Gnus/5.11 (Gnus v5.11) Emacs/22.3 (gnu/linux) |

---

```
Romain Francoise has found a security risk in a feature of GNU Emacs
related to how Emacs interacts with Python.  Emacs version 22.3, which
was just released, contains a fix.  A patch for earlier version of Emacs
is described below.

The vulnerability may allow an attacker to run malicious code if the
user runs the Emacs command `run-python' while the current directory is
world-writable, or if the user toggles `eldoc-mode' and visits a Python
source file in a world-writable directory.

Description of the vulnerability:

The Emacs command `run-python' launches an interactive Python
interpreter.  After the Python process starts up, Emacs automatically
sends it the line

import emacs

which normally imports a script named emacs.py which is distributed with
Emacs.  This script, which is typically located in a write-protected
installation directory with other Emacs program files, defines various
functions to help the Python process communicate with Emacs.

The vulnerability arises because Python, by default, prepends '' to the
module search path, so modules are looked for in the current directory.
If the current directory is world-writable, an attacker may insert
malicious code by adding a fake Python module named emacs.py into that
directory.

Furthermore, emacs.py imports other non-built-in Python modules, such as
`inspect'.  The same vulnerability exists for these import statements.

By default, merely visiting and editing a *.py source file does not
launch a Python subprocess; you either have to call `M-x run-python', or
enable Emacs code that calls `run-python' automatically, such as
`eldoc-mode'.

The Python developers, in a private communication, have stated that they
do not regard this module-importing behavior as a security problem for
Python per se, because running a python script in a world-writable
directory is itself a security hazard.  In the Emacs context, however,
it's much less obvious that it's unsafe to call `run-python' while the
current directory is world-writable; therefore, the problem discussed
here can be regarded as a security risk.

The following patch, against the Emacs 22.2 source tree, removes '' from
sys.path in the command-line arguments for invoking the Python process.
(Because `sys' is a "built-in module", an attacker cannot insert
malicious code by adding sys.py to the current directory.)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# GNU Emacs, XEmacs: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200902-06**

Two vulnerabilities were found in GNU Emacs, possibly leading to
user-assisted execution of arbitrary code. One also affects edit-utils in
XEmacs.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-editors/emacs** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **22.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **22.2-r3**revision >= **21.4-r17**< **19** |

| Package | **app-xemacs/edit-utils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.39** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.39** |

### Background

GNU Emacs and XEmacs are highly extensible and customizable text
editors. edit-utils are miscellaneous extensions to XEmacs.

### Description

Morten Welinder reports about GNU Emacs and edit-utils in XEmacs: By
shipping a .flc accompanying a source file (.c for example) and setting
font-lock-support-mode to fast-lock-mode in the source file through
local variables, any Lisp code in the .flc file is executed without
warning (CVE-2008-2142).

Romain Francoise reported a security risk in a feature of GNU Emacs
related to interacting with Python. The vulnerability arises because
Python, by default, prepends the current directory to the module search
path, allowing for arbitrary code execution when launched from a
specially crafted directory (CVE-2008-3949).

### Impact

Remote attackers could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
in GNU Emacs, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary Emacs Lisp
code or arbitrary Python code with the privileges of the user running
GNU Emacs or XEmacs.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GNU Emacs users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-editors/emacs-22.2-r3"
```

All edit-utils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-xemacs/edit-utils-2.39"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
