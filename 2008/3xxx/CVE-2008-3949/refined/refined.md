  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-3949",
      "root_cause": "The Emacs command `run-python` launches an interactive Python interpreter. After the Python process starts up, Emacs automatically sends it the line `import emacs`. Python, by default, prepends '' to the module search path, so modules are looked for in the current directory. If the current directory is world-writable, an attacker may insert malicious code by adding a fake Python module named emacs.py into that directory. Furthermore, emacs.py imports other non-built-in Python modules, such as `inspect'.  The same vulnerability exists for these import statements.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure default module search path in Python",
        "Emacs's automatic import of 'emacs' module from current directory when running python interpreter."
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Emacs or XEmacs.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Running the `run-python` command in Emacs while the current directory is world-writable.",
        "Toggling `eldoc-mode` and visiting a Python source file in a world-writable directory, which implicitly calls `run-python`."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious `emacs.py` file (and potentially other imported modules like `inspect`) in a world-writable directory where the victim is running emacs and then entice the victim to run python, or enable eldoc-mode in a python file in that directory."
