Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3796:

**Verification:**

The provided information confirms that CVE-2008-3796 is related to multiple crash fixes in the `swfdec` library, which is a free Flash decoder.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in multiple bugs within the `swfdec` library that could lead to crashes. These include issues in:
    - Decoding 1x1 JPEG images.
    - XMLSocket.send function.
    - FLV decoding when aborted.
    - Exception handling code.
    - Prototype loops.
    - Handling broken dates.
    - Native constructors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Crashes:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of multiple crash bugs that could lead to denial-of-service scenarios.
-   **Infinite Loops**:  Some issues could lead to infinite loops, effectively causing the application to hang.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation could lead to application crashes, preventing users from playing Flash content.
-   **Potential Remote Code Execution**: One source indicates that the crashes could potentially be exploited for remote code execution, although this is not explicitly confirmed in the other provided sources.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious SWF Files:** Attackers could create specially crafted SWF files that trigger the identified crash bugs.
-   **Network Delivery**: The malicious SWF files could be delivered via websites or other means that uses the `swfdec` library for flash content rendering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Provide Malicious SWF:** Attackers need the ability to provide specially crafted SWF files to a system using `swfdec`. This could be through a website, email attachment, or other means.
-   **No Elevated Privileges**: Exploitation would not require any special user privileges.
