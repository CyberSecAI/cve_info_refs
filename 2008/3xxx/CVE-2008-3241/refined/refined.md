{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `players-detail.php` file, specifically in how the `id` parameter from the GET request is handled. The application uses `DB_RemoveBadChars` to sanitize the input, but it fails to prevent SQL injection. The sanitized input is then directly used in a SQL query without proper type casting to an integer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords. In a broader context, it could lead to full compromise of the application data.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is remote, utilizing a specially crafted URL targeting the `players-detail.php` script with a malicious `id` parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs no authentication and must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. The complexity of the attack is low."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "vulnerable_versions": "Ultrastats versions <= 0.2.142 (tested on v0.2.136, v0.2.142)",
    "exploit_code": "The provided Perl script demonstrates a blind SQL injection technique. It extracts username, password (MD5 hash), and database prefix using a series of requests by comparing HTTP response based on the presence of specific strings in the page content. It leverages the vulnerable parameter to inject SQL conditions, effectively retrieving information char by char.",
     "fix": "The suggested quick fix involves casting the input to an integer using `intval()` after sanitizing with `DB_RemoveBadChars`."
