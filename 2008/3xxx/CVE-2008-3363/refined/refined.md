  "CVE-2008-3363": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "Dokeos E-Learning System 1.8.5 is vulnerable to local file inclusion via the 'include' GET parameter in user_portal.php. A registered user can exploit this vulnerability to include arbitrary local files.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize the 'include' GET parameter in the user_portal.php script before including it, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary local files.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary local files, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or remote code execution if the included file is under attacker control.",
      "attack_vector": "A registered user can send a crafted HTTP GET request to user_portal.php with the vulnerable 'include' parameter.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Dokeos E-Learning System.",
      "additional_info": "The vulnerability is located in /user_portal.php. The vulnerable code checks if the 'include' parameter is not empty, does not contain '/', and contains '.html', but it fails to prevent directory traversal using '..'. The fix is to replace the vulnerable line with a regular expression that only allows alphanumeric characters, underscores, and the '.html' extension."
