## Summary of CVE-2008-3914

Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2008-3914:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   The root cause is a flaw in ClamAV's error handling logic, specifically related to file descriptor management.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **File Descriptor Leak:** The vulnerability leads to file descriptor leaks within ClamAV's code, specifically in `libclamav/others.c` and `libclamav/sis.c`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. By triggering the file descriptor leak, an attacker can cause the ClamAV process to exhaust available file descriptors, leading to crashes and preventing it from functioning correctly. This can cause the ClamAV daemon to stop responding and become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The vulnerability can be triggered by scanning specially crafted files, though the exact nature of these files isn't explicitly detailed beyond the mention of `libclamav/others.c` and `libclamav/sis.c`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   An attacker needs to be able to submit files to be scanned by ClamAV. This could involve sending malicious attachments via email to a mail server which uses ClamAV or somehow tricking a user or automated system to scan a specially crafted file.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
*   The vulnerability is addressed in ClamAV version 0.94.
*   This CVE is often associated with two other ClamAV vulnerabilities: CVE-2008-3912 (null pointer dereference) and CVE-2008-3913 (memory leaks), all fixed in version 0.94.
*   Multiple Linux distributions like SUSE, Debian, and Gentoo have issued security advisories and updates to address this vulnerability.
*   Apple has also addressed this issue in their Security Update 2008-007, specifically for Mac OS X Server.

**In summary:** CVE-2008-3914 is a file descriptor leak vulnerability in ClamAV that can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service condition. It is often found alongside two other related ClamAV vulnerabilities, all of which are fixed in version 0.94.
