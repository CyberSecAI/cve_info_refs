{
  "CVE-2008-3200": {
    "Description": "The Avlc Forum application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the 'id' parameter in vlc_forum.php. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter, leading to an exploitable SQL injection vulnerability.",
    "Root cause": "The application directly incorporates the user-controlled 'id' parameter into a SQL query without sanitization or proper escaping.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data, data modification, or even complete database takeover. In the provided example, an attacker retrieves usernames from the `mysql.user` table.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `vlc_forum.php` script, specifically by manipulating the 'id' parameter.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No special privileges or authentication is required."
