# Gallery 1.5.8 Released

Submitted by ckdake on Tue, 2008-08-05 17:03

Gallery 1.5.8 is now available for download. This release fixes many security issues including some serious security issues. It also resolves as well as a handful of bugs and reorganizes the internal API some (which is [documented here](http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery1%3AAPI_Changes_From_1.5.7_To_1.5.8)). We **strongly** recommend that all users of Gallery 1.5.7 and earlier upgrade to this release to **protect your Gallery installation**. You can download Gallery 1.5.8 from the [Gallery 1](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7130&package_id=7239) download page on SourceForge. [Upgrade instructions](http://codex.gallery2.org/index.php/Gallery1%3AUpgrading) are available on our documentation site. Please discuss any issues specific to this release in [this forum thread](http://gallery.menalto.com/node/79698).

One security issue was reported to us in private by the [Digital Security Research Group [DSecRG]](http://www.dsec.ru) who were professional and are waiting until after this release to publish their findings.

The most of the security issues resolved in this release are the result of a security audit performed by [Gotham Digital Science](http://www.gdssecurity.com/) (GDS). They are experts in application security, as this is the primary focus of their business. We recognize that hiring external consultants to perform security audits does not guarantee that our code is bug-free and by no means un-hackable, but it clearly indicates our willingness to perform due diligence to make sure our code is reasonably secure. The combination of an external perspective of security experts and the insight of internal experts both performing detailed audits is yielding much better results than only one of the two perspectives alone. While these security fixes are not in our public source code repository prior to the release, we will begin adding them to it as soon as possible once this story is posted.

Submitted by sruckh on Wed, 2008-08-20 23:55.

in the lib/ sub-directory I had a file named Form.php, I had to rename this file to form.php before I could upgrade from 1.5.7. It appears the file in the package is correct:

gallery-1.5.8/lib/form.php

I am kind of wondering what happened here, but I thought I would post in case others see this issue??

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Gallery 1 and 2:

* Digital Security Research Group reported a directory traversal
  vulnerability in contrib/phpBB2/modules.php in Gallery 1, when
  register\_globals is enabled (CVE-2008-3600).
* Hanno Boeck reported that Gallery 1 and 2 did not set the secure flag
  for the session cookie in an HTTPS session (CVE-2008-3662).
* Alex Ustinov reported that Gallery 1 and 2 does not properly handle ZIP
  archives containing symbolic links (CVE-2008-4129).
* The vendor reported a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Gallery 2
  (CVE-2008-4130).

### Impact

Remote attackers could send specially crafted requests to a server
running Gallery, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code when
register\_globals is enabled, or read arbitrary files via directory
traversals otherwise. Attackers could also entice users to visit
crafted links allowing for theft of login credentials.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Gallery 2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/gallery-2.2.6"
```

All Gallery 1 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/gallery-1.5.9"
```
