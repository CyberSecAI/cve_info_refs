Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-3600:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the `contrib/phpBB2/modules.php` file of Gallery 1. This vulnerability is triggered when the `register_globals` PHP setting is enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows attackers to access files and directories outside of the intended web root, potentially exposing sensitive system files.
*  **register_globals:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered by the usage of the deprecated PHP feature `register_globals`, which allowed for variables to be created from HTTP requests, increasing the risk of arbitrary code execution in the presence of further flaws.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If combined with other vulnerabilities present in the application, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the server, by controlling the values of included files
*   **Local File Disclosure:** Attackers could read arbitrary files on the server via directory traversal.
*  **Data breach:** If the server contains sensitive data such as configuration, credentials or other sensitive user data, this could be obtained by the attacker

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can send specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. These requests would likely manipulate parameters used to load files, triggering the directory traversal.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Gallery installation.
*   **PHP `register_globals` enabled:** The server needs to have the `register_globals` PHP setting enabled for the attack to be successful. The `register_globals` setting is typically disabled by default for security reasons in most PHP installations after PHP 5.4.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable path:** The attacker needs to know the specific path to the vulnerable file, `contrib/phpBB2/modules.php`

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided information indicates that this vulnerability was reported by the Digital Security Research Group.
*   The information from the gentoo security advisory, GLSA 200811-02, is more detailed than the provided CVE description placeholder.
*   This is part of a set of multiple vulnerabilities fixed in Gallery versions 1.5.8 and 2.2.6.
