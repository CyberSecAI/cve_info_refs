Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3364

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `ObjRemoveCtrl` ActiveX control within Trend Micro OfficeScan. Specifically, the `Server` property of the ActiveX control is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when a large string is assigned to it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core weakness is the lack of bounds checking when copying data into the `Server` property's buffer. This allows an attacker to write past the allocated memory.
- **ActiveX Control Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within an ActiveX control, which are known to be a common attack vector for browser-based exploits.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer with malicious shellcode, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the targeted system.
- **Browser Crash:** Even if exploitation fails, the overflow can lead to a browser crash and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Browser:** The primary attack vector involves a user visiting a malicious webpage with a specially crafted HTML page. The malicious webpage would instantiate the vulnerable ActiveX control and trigger the overflow by setting the Server property with a long string.
- **Remote Exploitation:** Since the vulnerability is triggered by visiting a webpage, the attack is considered remote.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to host or deliver a malicious webpage:** The attacker needs to control a web server or inject the malicious code into a legitimate web page.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to visit the attacker's malicious webpage using a vulnerable version of Trend Micro OfficeScan and Internet Explorer.
- **Target System Configuration:** The target system must have a vulnerable version of Trend Micro OfficeScan installed with the vulnerable ActiveX control enabled within Internet Explorer.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit code provided utilizes a series of techniques including padding and shellcode insertion.
- The exploit is confirmed to work on Windows XP SP2 with IE6 and IE7, and OfficeScan 7.3 patch 4 using `OfficeScanRemoveCtrl.dll` version 7.3.0.1020.
- It is mentioned that OfficeScan 8.x uses `strcpy_s`, which throws an `INVALID_PARAMETER` error and still results in a browser crash, but it does not permit arbitrary code execution.
- The exploit leverages the Metasploit framework for generating shellcode.
- The provided exploit code includes shellcode for both executing a calculator and binding to a specific port (4444).
