{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes files based on user-controlled input without sufficient sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially leading to information disclosure and in some cases code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'template' parameter in the URL to include a file path.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and modify the 'template' parameter in the URL. No prior authentication is required."
