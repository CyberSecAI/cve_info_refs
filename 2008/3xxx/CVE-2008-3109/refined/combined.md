Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The IBM 1.6.0 Java release includes the IBM Java 2 Runtime Environment and
the IBM Java 2 Software Development Kit.

A flaw was found in the Java Management Extensions (JMX) management agent.
When local monitoring is enabled, remote attackers could use this flaw to
perform illegal operations. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3103](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3103) to this issue.

Several flaws involving the handling of unsigned applets were found. A
remote attacker could misuse an unsigned applet in order to connect to
services on the host running the applet. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3104](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3104) to this issue.

Several flaws in the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) client and the
JAX-WS service implementation were found. A remote attacker who could cause
malicious XML to be processed by an application could access URLs, or cause
a denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2008-3105](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3105) and [CVE-2008-3106](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3106) to these issues.

Several flaws within the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) scripting support
were found. A remote attacker could grant an untrusted applet extended
privileges, such as reading and writing local files, executing
local programs, or querying the sensitive data of other applets.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2008-3109](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3109) and [CVE-2008-3110](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3110) to these issues.

A flaw in Java Web Start was found. Using an untrusted Java Web
Start application, a remote attacker could create or delete arbitrary
files with the permissions of the user running the untrusted application.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3112](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3112) to this issue.

A flaw in Java Web Start when processing untrusted applications was found.
An attacker could use this flaw to acquire sensitive information, such as
the location of the cache. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3114](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3114) to this issue.

### Background

The Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Sun Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the Sun Java platform.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in the Sun Java
implementation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below and
the associated Sun Alerts for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted JAR
archive, applet, or Java Web Start application, possibly resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. Furthermore, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of
Service affecting multiple services via several vectors, disclose
information and memory contents, write or execute local files, conduct
session hijacking attacks via GIFAR files, steal cookies, bypass the
same-origin policy, load untrusted JAR files, establish network
connections to arbitrary hosts and posts via several vectors, modify
the list of supported graphics configurations, bypass HMAC-based
authentication systems, escalate privileges via several vectors and
cause applet code to be executed with older, possibly vulnerable
versions of the JRE.

NOTE: Some vulnerabilities require a trusted environment, user
interaction, a DNS Man-in-the-Middle or Cross-Site-Scripting attack.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Sun JRE 1.5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.5.0.22"
```

All Sun JRE 1.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.6.0.17"
```

All Sun JDK 1.5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.5.0.22"
```

All Sun JDK 1.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.6.0.17"
```

All users of the precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.5.x should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.5.0.22"
```

All users of the precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.6.x should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.6.0.17"
```

All Sun JRE 1.4.x, Sun JDK 1.4.x, Blackdown JRE, Blackdown JDK and
precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.4.x users are strongly advised to unmerge
Java 1.4:

```
 # emerge --unmerge =app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge =dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge =dev-java/sun-jdk-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge dev-java/blackdown-jdk
 # emerge --unmerge dev-java/blackdown-jre
```

Gentoo is ceasing support for the 1.4 generation of the Sun Java
Platform in accordance with upstream. All 1.4 JRE and JDK versions are
masked and will be removed shortly.

v1.6.0. The java-1.6.0-bea packages are vulnerable to the following
security flaws:

* A flaw was found in the Java Management Extensions (JMX)
  management agent.
  When local monitoring was enabled, remote attackers could use this flaw
  to
  perform illegal operations.
* Several flaws involving the handling of unsigned applets were found.
  A
  remote attacker could misuse an unsigned applet in order to connect to
  services on the host running the applet.
* Several flaws in the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) client
  and the
  JAX-WS service implementation were found. A remote attacker could cause
  malicious XML
  to be processed by an application, or could cause a denial of
  service.
* Several flaws within the Java Runtime Environment's (JRE) scripting
  support
  were found. A remote attacker could grant an untrusted applet extended
  privileges, such as reading and writing local files, executing local
  programs, or querying the sensitive data of other applets.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names
[CVE-2008-3103](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3103),

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Sun Java was updated to 1.4.2 update level 18, 1.5.0 update level 16
and 1.6.0 update level 7 to fix the following security vulnerabilities:
CVE-2008-3115: Secure Static Versioning in Sun Java JDK and JRE 6
Update 6 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 6 through 15, does not properly
prevent execution of applets on older JRE releases, which might allow
remote attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in these older releases.
CVE-2008-3114: Unspecified vulnerability in Sun Java Web Start in JDK
and JRE 6 before Update 7, JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update 16, and SDK
and JRE 1.4.x before 1.4.2\_18 allows context-dependent attackers to
obtain sensitive information (the cache location) via an untrusted
application, aka CR 6704074.
CVE-2008-3113: Unspecified vulnerability in Sun Java Web Start in JDK
and JRE 5.0 before Update 16 and SDK and JRE 1.4.x before 1.4.2\_18
allows remote attackers to create or delete arbitrary files via an
untrusted application, aka CR 6704077.
CVE-2008-3112: Unspecified vulnerability in Sun Java Web Start in
JDK and JRE 6 before Update 7, JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update 16, and
SDK and JRE 1.4.x before 1.4.2\_18 allows remote attackers to create
arbitrary files via an untrusted application, aka CR 6703909.
CVE-2008-3111: Multiple buffer overflows in Sun Java Web Start in JDK
and JRE 6 before Update 4, JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update 16, and SDK
and JRE 1.4.x before 1.4.2\_18 allow context-dependent attackers to
gain privileges via an untrusted application, as demonstrated by an
application that grants itself privileges to (1) read local files, (2)
write to local files, or (3) execute local programs, aka CR 6557220.
CVE-2008-3110: Unspecified vulnerability in scripting language support
in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 Update 6 and
earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by
using an applet to read information from another applet.
CVE-2008-3109: Unspecified vulnerability in scripting language
support in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 Update
6 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to gain privileges
via an untrusted (1) application or (2) applet, as demonstrated by
an application or applet that grants itself privileges to (a) read
local files, (b) write to local files, or (c) execute local programs.
CVE-2008-3108: Buffer overflow in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
in JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update 10, SDK and JRE 1.4.x before 1.4.2\_18,
and SDK and JRE 1.3.x before 1.3.1\_23 allows context-dependent
attackers to gain privileges via unspecified vectors related to
font processing.
CVE-2008-3107: Unspecified vulnerability in the Virtual Machine in
Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 before Update 7,
JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update 16, and SDK and JRE 1.4.x before 1.4.2\_18
allows context-dependent attackers to gain privileges via an untrusted
(1) application or (2) applet, as demonstrated by an application
or applet that grants itself privileges to (a) read local files,
(b) write to local files, or (c) execute local programs.
CVE-2008-3106: Unspecified vulnerability in Sun Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 Update 6 and earlier and JDK and
JRE 5.0 Update 15 and earlier allows remote attackers to access
URLs via unknown vectors involving processing of XML data by an
untrusted (1) application or (2) applet, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2008-3105.
CVE-2008-3105: Unspecified vulnerability in the JAX-WS client
and service in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6
Update 6 and earlier allows remote attackers to access URLs or cause
a denial of service via unknown vectors involving "processing
of XML data" by a trusted application.
CVE-2008-3104: Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Sun Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 before Update 7, JDK and
JRE 5.0 before Update 16, SDK and JRE 1.4.x before 1.4.2\_18, and SDK
and JRE 1.3.x before 1.3.1\_23 allow remote attackers to violate the
security model for an applets outbound connections by connecting to
localhost services running on the machine that loaded the applet.
CVE-2008-3103: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Management
Extensions (JMX) management agent in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
in JDK and JRE 6 Update 6 and earlier and JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 15
and earlier, when local monitoring is enabled, allows remote attackers
to "perform unauthorized operations" via unspecified vectors.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Java after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. Privilege escalation on 64-bit guest operating systems
VMware products emulate hardware functions, like CPU, Memory, and IO.
A flaw in VMware's CPU hardware emulation could allow the virtual CPU to jump to an incorrect memory address. Exploitation of this issue on the guest operating system does not lead to a compromise of the host system but could lead to a privilege escalation on guest operating system. An attacker would need to have a user account on the guest operating system.
Affected
64-bit Windows and 64-bit FreeBSD guest operating systems and possibly other 64-bit operating systems. The issue does not affect the 64-bit versions of Linux guest operating systems.
VMware would like to thank Derek Soeder for discovering this issue and working with us on its remediation.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4279 this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

NOTE: The set of guest operating systems which is affected by this issue is a subset of 64-bit operating systems (see above for details)

#####

b. Update for VirtualCenter fixes a potential information disclosure
This release resolves an issue where a user's password could be displayed in cleartext. When logging into VirtualCenter Server 2.0 with Virtual Infrastructure Client 2.5, the user password might be displayed if it contains certain special characters. The dialog box displaying the password can appear in front or hidden behind other windows.
To remediate this issue the VirtualCenter client installations must be updated after updating to VirtualCenter Update 3
VMware would like to thank Mark Woollatt for reporting this issue to VMware.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4278 to this issue.

 Notes: These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely only if the attacker has access to the Service Console network. Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the Service Console be isolated from the VM network. Please see [www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726) for more information on VMware security best practices.

 The currently installed version of JRE depends on your patch deployment history.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
