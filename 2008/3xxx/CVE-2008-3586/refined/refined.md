Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3586

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the `com_ezstore` component of Joomla. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `detail` function, triggered through the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not directly output the result of the SQL query, making it a blind SQL injection. The attacker has to infer results based on the application's response (in this case, the presence of a specific string in the HTML output).
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, or other confidential data. In this specific case, the provided exploit targets the `password` field from the `jos_users` table.
- **Potential for Full Database Compromise:** Although the provided exploit only extracts the first user's password, the vulnerability could be used to access other database data, and potentially modify data or execute SQL code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request targeting the vulnerable Joomla component, injecting SQL code into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Joomla application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** The attacker must know that the `com_ezstore` component is used by the target application and is vulnerable.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP GET requests to exploit the vulnerability.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
The provided content includes a Perl exploit script that demonstrates how to exploit this blind SQL injection. The script shows exactly how the vulnerability works and how an attacker can extract data, specifically an MD5 hash of a user password in this case, from the database. It also provides command-line options for specifying a product id and category ID, which allows the exploit to target specific areas of the application. The script also provides information about the targeted vulnerable component and version via the dork provided: "inurl:com_ezstore". The exploit also provides details of the HTTP request structure and SQL injection technique. This provides much more detail than a basic CVE description would offer.
