Root cause of vulnerability:
Integer overflow in the Text-to-PostScript "texttops" filter within CUPS.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Integer overflow leading to a heap buffer overflow vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the "lp" user (the user running the CUPS server).

Attack vectors:
- By printing a specially crafted text file that exploits the integer overflow vulnerability.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to submit print jobs to a CUPS server.
