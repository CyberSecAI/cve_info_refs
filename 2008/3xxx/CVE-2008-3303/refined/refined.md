          "vulnerability": "Login Bypass",
          "description": "The admin login check in 'login.php' can be bypassed when register_globals is enabled. The script does not properly initialize the `$login` and `$password` variables, which can be set through URL parameters. By setting these variables and submitting the login form, an attacker can gain administrative access.",

Although the `enCode` function sanitizes HTML chars,  `stripslashes()` and `html_entity_decode()` is used on the 'widget.php' file, so it's possible to inject malicious code and trigger it when a victim visits the `widget.php` page."

By providing a crafted URL with malicious JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code when a victim visits the page. Additionally, several XSS vulnerabilities are present in admin files and 'footer.php' by passing unsanitized data in the URL.  Examples: `http://site.com/bilboblog/?titleId=</title></head><body><script>alert(1);</script>`, `http://site.com/bilboblog/footer.php?t_lang[lang_copyright]=XSS`, `http://site.com/bilboblog/admin/?content=&lt;/textarea&gt;XSS` "

The `num` parameter, which is directly inserted into the SQL query, is not sanitized, leading to SQL injection if `magic_quotes` is off. An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to delete all entries (or perform other SQL operations).",
          "example": "A POST request to `delete.php` with `num=-1'  OR num_article > 0#` can delete all entries."
