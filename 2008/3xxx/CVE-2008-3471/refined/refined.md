Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-3471:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper memory allocation in Microsoft Excel when loading Excel objects. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft Excel parses the BIFF (Binary Interchange File Format) file format.
- During the processing of a malformed record, user-supplied data is copied into a stack-based buffer using a size that is calculated based on contents from the record.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability when parsing malformed BIFF files.
- Insufficient validation of data within the BIFF file format during parsing.
- Improper memory allocation while loading excel objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
- Attackers could install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- Impact is dependent on user privileges; users with fewer rights may be less impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Opening a specially crafted Excel file containing a malformed object or a malformed BIFF record.
- The attack can be delivered through email attachments or through malicious files hosted on websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious Excel file (.xls)
- Ability to deliver the malicious file to a victim, typically by convincing them to open the file. This can be achieved through email or by hosting the file on a malicious website.
