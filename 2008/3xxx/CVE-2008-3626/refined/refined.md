Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-3626:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Apple QuickTime handles 'STSZ' atoms within movie files. Specifically, a memory corruption issue arises when an entry in the `sample_size_table` within an STSZ atom is excessively large.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based memory corruption. A too large entry in sample_size_table causes the memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially execute code with the same privileges as the user running QuickTime.
-  Also noted is the possibility of unexpected application termination if arbitrary code execution is unsuccessful.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted movie file. 
- The user must interact with the malicious file, either by opening it directly or visiting a malicious web page which embeds it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted movie file with a malformed `sample_size_table` in the `STSZ` atom. 
- The attacker must deliver the malicious file to the target and trick them into opening or viewing it.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Apple by an anonymous researcher working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative.
- Apple addressed this issue in QuickTime 7.5.5 by implementing improved bounds checking of STSZ atoms.
- The vulnerability affects multiple platforms: Mac OS X v10.4.9 - v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 or later, Windows Vista, XP SP2 and SP3.
- Apple TV 1.0 and 2.1 are also vulnerable.
