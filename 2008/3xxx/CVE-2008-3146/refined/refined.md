Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-3146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in multiple buffer overflows within the NCP (NetWare Core Protocol) dissector of Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the presence of multiple buffer overflows in the NCP dissector. This means that the dissector does not properly validate the size of the input data, allowing an attacker to write data beyond the allocated buffer.
- Insufficient input validation when parsing NCP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most common impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities is a crash of the Wireshark application, which would cause a denial of service and prevent normal analysis of network traffic.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory also indicates that exploitation could potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code, though this is not explicitly verified as the primary impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject specifically crafted, malformed NCP packets onto a network that is being monitored by a vulnerable instance of Wireshark.
- **Malicious Capture Files:** An attacker can trick a user into opening a malicious packet capture file (.pcap, .cap, etc.) which contains the specially crafted NCP packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access/Position:** An attacker must either be on the same network as the targeted Wireshark instance or have the ability to send packets to it.
- **Social Engineering:** For the malicious capture file attack vector, an attacker needs the ability to convince the victim to open a crafted file.
- **Knowledge of Protocol Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of how the vulnerability in the NCP dissector can be triggered by crafting a malicious NCP packet.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Wireshark versions 0.9.7 up to and including 1.0.2.
- Wireshark 1.0.3 and later versions contain the fix.
- Several sources mention that this was part of a larger set of security flaws fixed in Wireshark 1.0.3, including other DoS issues from malformed zlib compressed data and Tektronix .rf5 files.
- It is suggested that the update also changes the default PAM configuration to prompt for the root password before each start of Wireshark.
