Not yet clear.  It crashes F-8 OOo, which should have this patch applied.  But valgrind only reports out-of-bound read, so may not be a security sensitive issue.

I'm happy to hear opinions of those more familiar with the beast^W^Wopenoffice.org internals."  I think I cc'ed you on the email about it earlier today ? I'll wait for a second opinion from sj at OOo but my opinion is that (after the previous alloc fix in place to avoid a situation where we could be fooled into allocating too little memory for future reads) that it should just attempt to allocate a gigantic image which will crap out and die (safely) in < 2.4 and get caught with a bad_alloc handler in >= 2.4.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=455867#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2008-07-18 14:56:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=455867#c6)) > I think I cc'ed you on the email about it earlier today ?  Yes, thank you!

Yes, it seems quite likely that that's what happening here.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=455867#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2008-07-21 12:39:33 UTC  ``` Upstream bug report for PCX parser issue with proposed Caolan's patch:  <http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=91818>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=455867#c11)  lihuang    2008-07-29 02:21:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 312838](attachment.cgi?id=312838 "crash report") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=312838&action=edit "crash report") crash report  Reproduce with openoffice.org-draw-2.3.0-6.7.el5.x86_64 on RGEK5.2 x86_64 Client   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=455867#c12)  lihuang    2008-07-29 02:54:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 312840](attachment.cgi?id=312840 "another .pcx file") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=312840&action=edit "another .pcx file") another .pcx file  Tried with another .pcx file . this time OOo works well  # file Blue\ hills8.pcx  Blue hills8.pcx: PCX ver. 3.0 image data bounding box [0, 0] - [799, 599], 3 planes each of 8-bit image, 300 x 300 dpi, RLE compressed   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=455867#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2008-08-06 10:03:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 313545](attachment.cgi?id=313545&action=diff "salbmp.cxx diff between 2.3.0 and 2.4.1") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=313545&action=edit "salbmp.cxx diff between 2.3.0 and 2.4.1") salbmp.cxx diff between 2.3.0 and 2.4.1  This change adds try-catch for std::bad_alloc exception, which should prevent OpenOffice.org from "crashing" in X11SalBitmap::ImplCreateDI when memory allocation fails.

Additional sanity checks were add upstream, as noted in the upstream bug report:    <http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=91818>  2) Because of 1), OpenOffice.org attempted to allocate memory chunk with negative size.  That value was later converted via signed -> unsigned conversion to a large positive value.  When memory allocator was not able to allocate that large memory chunk, it raised std::bad_alloc exception.  This exception was not properly handled by the bitmap code, resulting in an unexpected OpenOffice.org termination.  This issue was fixed upstream prior to release of upstream version 2.4.1.  Related upstream bug report:    <http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=82997>  3) Additionally, OpenOffice.org's custom memory allocator contained a numeric truncation error that affected 64bit builds that do use OpenOffice.org's memory allocator.  This issue could result in memory corruption triggered by crafted file (PCX image, in this case), possibly allowing code execution.  Related upstream bug report:    <http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=92217>   Only issue 3) has security implications and is tracked via [bug #458056](show_bug.cgi?id=458056 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-3282 openoffice.org: numeric truncation error in memory allocator (64bit)") and was assigned CVE id [CVE-2008-3282](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-3282).  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 458056](show_bug.cgi?id=458056 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-3282 openoffice.org: numeric truncation error in memory allocator (64bit)") ***   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=458056#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-08-06 12:46:36 UTC  ``` It was discovered, that OpenOffice.org memory allocator is not 64bit clean. rtl_allocateMemory() function in sal/rtl/source/alloc_global.c accepts one argument - sal_Size n.  On 64bit platforms such as x86_64, sal_Size is defined as unsigned long int.  This requested memory chunk size is later memory aligned as size (type sal_Size).  size is later used to calculate int index to g_alloc_table[] array:    int index = (size - 1) >> RTL_MEMALIGN_SHIFT;  However, as sizeof(int) == 4 and sizeof(sal_Size) == 8 on 64bit platforms, the calculated value may not fit into index (this can happen when rtl_allocateMemory() is called with large argument, e.g. when some other flaw causes OpenOffice to attempt to allocate chunk of memory with negative size, which wraps to large positive value during signed -> unsigned type conversion, such as [1]).  Value stored in the index is wrapped / truncated, possibly resulting in the index being negative.  Before index is used, it is checked not to exceed fixed upper limit, but it's not checked whether its value is >= 0:    if (index < RTL_MEMORY_CACHED_LIMIT >> RTL_MEMALIGN_SHIFT)  Negative index used in g_alloc_table[index] will cause OpenOffice to access memory outside of the g_alloc_table[] array.  This may result it crash, or if that points to an attacker controlled memory, attacker may possibly be able to use this flaw to run arbitrary code.  [1] <http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=91818>     <http://scary.beasts.org/security/CESA-2008-006.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=458056#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-08-06 13:08:36 UTC  ``` OpenOffice.org upstream is aware of this issue, but they do not plan to release any security advisory for it, as they do not ship any 64bit pre-built packages. Issue was fixed upstream shortly after we reported it.  Upstream bug report:    <http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=92217>  This issue does not affect openoffice.org and openoffice.org2 packages as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4, as only 32bit builds are shipped in those versions.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=458056#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2008-08-07 12:53:49 UTC  ``` Rene Engelhard of Debian pointed out that 64bit builds that use system memory allocator instead of the OpenOffice.org custom one (i.e. compiled with --with-alloc=system) are also unaffected by this problem.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=458056#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2008-08-27 16:46:01 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=458056#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2008-08-27 18:01:24 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 455867](show_bug.cgi?id=455867 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - openoffice.org: crash on malformed PCX image (CESA-2008-006)") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=458056#c9)  Fedora Update System    2008-09-10 06:39:18 UTC  ``` openoffice.org-2.4.1-17.6.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
