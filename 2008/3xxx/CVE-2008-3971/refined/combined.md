Subject: CVE id requests: gmanedit

Hi

There are two possible buffer overflows in gmanedit. One is via crafted
configuration file and the other one via crafted manual page.
See the Debian bug report for more information.
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=497835>

Could I please get CVE ids for these issues?

Cheers
Steffen

Hi,

Gmanedit includes several buffer overflows. It needs to be audited
seriously, user input is never checked. Here are the ones i found :

	*	Launch the wizard, click all the boxes, complete the wizard. Check
		for "cad[512]" in the source, it's where the problem is, it should
		be increased ; it fixes the problem, but it's ugly.

	*	Launch the wizard, type a very long line in title or name of the
		manpage. At first the UI doesn't limit the number of characters
		you can enter, then the code handles it badly.

	*	Open preferences, flood the inputbox.

	*	Same like above, but this time it comes from the rc file. Just fill the
		"COMMAND=" parameters with a lot of characters.

	*	Fill the editor with a 200kb file, then try to see the man ("view
		created page").

Maybe there are some others, so it needs a good audit. I don't send a
patch, because i can't fix properly, but don't hesitate to ask me
more if you need.

Regards,

```

Hello François,

thanks for all your bug reports, it is much appreciated!

I currently don't have time to work on a new version (I am also the
upstream maintainer), because I will go on holiday this weekend for 3
weeks. When I get back I will start working on an updated version.
Please feel free to use the Debian BTS when you find more bugs.

Thanks,
Joop pa3aba at debian dot org

I took a look at these and they are definitely bugs but not
security issues. At least I currently see no way how an
attacker could use these bugs to exploit a victim. Loading
files with long titles works fine for example. I'll continue
to have a look at the rest of the code.

Cheers
Nico

Hi Steffen,
Ccing the bug report.

In theory it is possible to overflow a buffer with a large COMMAND
string in the configuration file (I find it not very likely
that someone sends you a gmanedit configuration file
though):

callbacks.c:
    638         gchar command[50],*datos;
    639         gint exitstatus;
    640
    641 /* I read conf file ~/.gmaneditrc */
    642
    643         strcpy(temp, "/tmp/gmanedit.XXXXXX");
    644         mkstemp (temp);
    645         datos=ReadConfFromFile("COMMAND");
    646
    647         if (datos==NULL)
    648         {
    ...
    651         }
    652         else
    653         {
    654                 strcpy(command,datos);
    655                 strcat(command," -l ");
    656                 strcat(command,temp);
    657         }

The buffer that comes from ReadConfFromFile can be bigger than command can take:
    862 static gchar *ReadConfFromFile(gchar *variable)
    863 {
    864   FILE *f;
    865   gchar readed[100];
    866   gchar *home;
    867   gchar *tok;
    868
    869 // Intento de abrir el fichero con la configuración personalizada
    870   home = getenv("HOME");
    871   strcpy(readed,home);
    872   strcat(readed,"/.gmaneditrc");
    ...
    880   while (fgets(readed,80,f) != NULL)
    881   {
    882 // Lo siguiente quita los retornos de carro de las líneas leidas
    883      if (readed[strlen(readed)-1] == '\n')
    884         readed[strlen(readed)-1] = '\0';
    885
    886      if ((readed[0] != '#') && (!strncmp(variable,readed,strlen(variable))))
    887      {
    888         tok = strtok(readed,"=");
    889         tok = strtok(NULL,"=");
    890         fclose(f);
    891         return(tok);

In practice this is a bug because the pointer on readed is not valid anymore after
the function was left. It can be still available though
in some cases. It should be fixed definitely.

Similar problems are all over the code, heavy strcpy/strcat usage without
any bounds checking but using self supplied data.

When reading a manpage file there can be a problem if the text is converted to utf8:
callbacks.c:
   1148 static void open_man_file(gchar *manfile)
   ...
   1156         gchar *utf8;
   1157         gchar * buffer = (gchar*)malloc(BUFFER_SIZE);
   1158
   1159
   ....
   1179         if ((f=gzopen((gchar *)manfile,"rb"))!=NULL)
   1180         {
   1181           while(!gzeof(f))
   1182           {
   1183                 bytes_read=gzread(f,buffer,BUFFER_SIZE);
   1184                 if (bytes_read>0)
   1185                 {
   1186                         utf8 = NULL;
   1187                         if (g_utf8_validate(buffer, -1, NULL) == FALSE)
   1188                         {
   1189                                 utf8 = g_locale_to_utf8(buffer, -1, NULL, NULL, NULL);
   1190                         }
   1191                         if (utf8 != NULL)
   1192                                 strncpy(buffer,utf8,strlen(utf8));
   1193                         gtk_text_buffer_insert_at_cursor(tb, buffer ,bytes_read);

This should be an exploitable heap overflow. When converting the manpage buffer from the
current locale to utf8 (line 1189) the resulting buffer can be bigger than
the previous locale buffer. As the strncpy call in line 1192 is useless as it uses strlen(utf8)
as the upper bound it is possible to overflow buffer in some situations.
Because of this I raise the severity and readd the security tag.

The overall code quality is pretty bad from my point of view and this
program should be heavily reworked.

Kind regards
Nico

Thanks,

I have never had a serious look at the actual code. My job has been to
port gmanedit to GTK+ version 2, to make sure this software would not
get lost.

I will start on a rework in a few weeks time. If you feel the package

retitle 497835 gmanedit: [CVE-2008-3971](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3971) buffer overflow when converting manpage to utf8
thanks

Hi,
the utf8 conversion issue got [CVE-2008-3971](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3971) as an
identifier, the COMMANDS issue is treated as a security
issue as there is no need to overflow a buffer since the
COMMANDS configuration variable can contain malicious
commands anyway.

Attached is a debdiff to fix most of the minor (not security
relevant) buffer overflows and the utf8 conversion thing.

It will be also archived on:
<http://people.debian.org/~nion/nmu-diff/gmanedit-0.4.1-1_0.4.1-1.1.patch>

Cheers
Nico

Use CVE-2008-3971, which covers the manual page and (if it's
security-relevant) the configuration page.  Even though the source of
attack is different, the vuln type is the same.

Nico - I don't know the typical usage scenarios for gmanedit, but if the
design of the configuration file allows the user to define dangerous
actions (such as their own executable commands), then it's clearly not
intended for external influence and wouldn't count as a vuln in my book.
Still would be merged under CVE-2008-3971 if there's a scenario.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

# CVE-2008-3971

| **Name** | CVE-2008-3971 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Heap-based buffer overflow in the open\_man\_file function in callbacks.c in gmanedit 0.4.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted man page, which is not properly handled during utf8 conversion.

I share your opinion here, I'd rather see the COMMANDS thing
as an application bug as a user who doesn't read the
configuration but just uses it could also get owned with a
valid command. The only difference I see is that as far as I
understood the command is only executed after user action
while the configuration value is read without. The manpage
utf-8 conversion is the real vulnerability as it is possible
to exploit a victim by opening a crafted manpage in
gmanedit.

Cheers
Nico
