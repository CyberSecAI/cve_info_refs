Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The "Press This!" feature in WordPress 2.6 was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input. Specifically, the `wp-admin/press-this.php` script was vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **XSS Vulnerability:** The `press-this.php` script did not properly sanitize user-provided input when handling video and thickbox functionalities, which allowed for the injection of malicious script tags through the `s` and `i` parameters. Specifically, the vulnerability was in how image URLs were extracted and processed. The regex used for image extraction was not restrictive enough.
*   **Temporary File Handling:**  Users without `unfiltered_upload` capabilities were able to download arbitrary files to the temporary directory, which would not be deleted upon `wp_handle_sideload` failing.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the `press-this.php` page. This code could then be executed within the victim's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, hijack user sessions, or perform other malicious actions on the compromised WordPress site.
*   **Temporary File Storage:** A malicious actor could potentially fill up the temp directory by uploading files, and potentially expose the files to unauthorized access if the webserver config is not strict enough.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **GET Parameters:** The XSS vulnerability could be exploited by crafting malicious URLs with script tags in the `s` parameter for video or `i` parameter for thickbox.
    *   Example payloads:
        *   `http://localhost/wp/wp-admin/press-this.php/?ajax=video&s=%3C/textarea%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E`
        *   `http://localhost/wp/wp-admin/press-this.php/?ajax=thickbox&i=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E`
*   **Malicious Image URLs:** An attacker could embed malicious Javascript in an `img` tag's `src` attribute on a remote page that gets processed by "Press This!".
    * Example: `<img src="');alert(document.cookie);///.jpg">`
*   **Media Sideload:** By initiating a media sideload with an invalid filetype, and publishing a post with a reference to the sideload, the temporary file would not be deleted if the `WP_CONTENT_DIR` was writable

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker would need to be able to craft a malicious URL.
* For the file handling vulnerability, the attacker would need an account with  `publish_post` capability, and the `WP_CONTENT_DIR` had to be writable.

**Additional Notes**
*  This vulnerability was present in development SVN snapshots of WordPress, but it was not present in any released version prior to 2.6.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by sanitizing image URLs using `kses`, implementing more restrictive regex for image extraction, and unlinking the temporary file upon sideload failure.
