According to

  <http://wordpress.org/development/2008/07/wordpress-26-tyner/>

affected Press This! feature is one of the "hot" news in wordpress
2.6.  Affected wp-admin/press-this.php does not seem to exist in
previous stable version 2.5.1.  This is just based on the very quick
look, but it seems this issue may only affect some development SVN
snapshots, but no released version.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Committed a quick fix. Might need to pass true to format\_to\_edit() or use wp\_richedit\_pre() when dealing with the rich editor.

Take a look to `photo_images`, the pattern to retrieve images should be more restrictive or the result of that action should be urlencoded. For example, if a page contains the following text it makes WP vulnerable:

```
<img src="demo<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>">

```

I'll take a quick look at this, but will be out until next week. (Getting married!)

Perhaps we should run the img src through kses.

### [#9](#comment:9) [@xknown](https://profiles.wordpress.org/xknown) [17 years](/timeline?from=2008-07-02T16%3A47%3A42Z&precision=second "See timeline at 07/02/2008 04:47:42 PM") ago

Another problem I recently found is that users without `unfiltered_upload` capability are able to download any file via the `media_sideload_*` to the tmp dir (`get_temp_dir()` will return `WP_CONTENT_DIR` if it's writable), so when `wp_handle_sideload` fails (because of `wp_check_filetype` check) it will not delete the temporary file that was downloaded in the previous step.

Steps to reproduce the problem:

* Log in as an unprivileged user, but with `publish_post` capability and go to `http://localhost/wp/wp-admin/press-this.php`.
* Select "Photo" tab, after that click on "Add from URL +" and then enter any url. ie `http://localhost/dummy.php`
* Now insert a link into the content box `<a href="http://localhost/dummy.php">dummy</a>` -- it's used to ensure that there is a reference to the fake image.
* Click on "Publish" button.

The post won't be inserted but like I said, if `WP_CONTENT_DIR` is writable the temporary file won't be deleted.

### [#10](#comment:10) [@xknown](https://profiles.wordpress.org/xknown) [17 years](/timeline?from=2008-07-02T17%3A09%3A40Z&precision=second "See timeline at 07/02/2008 05:09:40 PM") ago

By the way, [[8237]](/changeset/8237 "Don't match images with tags in them. Props noel. see #7220") still doesn't solve the issue, you can actually execute JS if a page contains something like:

```
<img src="');alert(document.cookie);///.jpg">

```

### [#11](#comment:11) [@ryan](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ryan) [17 years](/timeline?from=2008-07-02T19%3A21%3A26Z&precision=second "See timeline at 07/02/2008 07:21:26 PM") ago

Yeah, I think we need kses for that.

### [#12](#comment:12) [@ryan](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ryan) [17 years](/timeline?from=2008-07-02T22%3A40%3A53Z&precision=second "See timeline at 07/02/2008 10:40:53 PM") ago

(In [[8241]](/changeset/8241 "Unlink temporary file if sideload fails. see #7220")) Unlink temporary file if sideload fails. see [#7220](/ticket/7220 "#7220: defect (bug): Press This vulnerabilities (closed: fixed)")

Temp file is now unlinked on failure. I'm not really sure what the point of the sideload is though.

### [#15](#comment:15) [@noel](https://profiles.wordpress.org/noel) [17 years](/timeline?from=2008-07-02T23%3A24%3A44Z&precision=second "See timeline at 07/02/2008 11:24:44 PM") ago

The sideload is to connect with the media library even if you can't do a POST. Faking a POST was an option, but not an elegant one. Andy and Andrew nudged me in the direction of creating a sideload function for ajax type loading.

I'm out till mid-next week.
