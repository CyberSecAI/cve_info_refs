Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2008-3159:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content from `www.zerodayinitiative.com` and `www.novell.com` directly references CVE-2008-3159. The description and details match, confirming its relevance.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the `dhost.exe` module of Novell eDirectory.
*   **Weakness:** Flawed arithmetic on a user-supplied value leads to an integer overflow, causing a stack-based buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server by exploiting the stack smash through SEH (Structured Exception Handling) redirection.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote, network-based attack via TCP port 524 (default port for `dhost.exe`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without authentication.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `ds` module loaded by the `dhost.exe` process.
*   The flaw involves performing arithmetic on user-provided data. When the arithmetic operations overflow, a buffer overflow occurs on the stack.
*   The attacker leverages SEH to gain control of the execution flow and execute arbitrary code.

**4. Affected Products:**

*   Novell eDirectory 8.8 for All Platforms
*   Novell eDirectory 8.7.3 for All Platforms

**5. Resolution:**

*   eDirectory 8.8.2: Apply eDir 8.8.2 ftf2 or later
*   eDirectory 8.7.3: Apply eDir 8.7.3 SP10b or later

**6. Additional Information:**

*   The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) assigned ZDI-08-041 as their tracking ID and ZDI-CAN-276 as the internal tracking ID.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via filter ID 5946.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Novell on 2007-12-04.
*   The public release of the advisory was on 2008-07-10.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Sebastian Apelt.

**Summary:**

CVE-2008-3159 is a critical vulnerability in Novell eDirectory caused by an integer overflow leading to a stack buffer overflow in the `dhost.exe` module. This allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code. Patches were released by Novell to address this issue.
