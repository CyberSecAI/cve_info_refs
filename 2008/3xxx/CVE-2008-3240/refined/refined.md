Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3240:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `pgm` parameter of the `index.php` script. This parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied input is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, leading to the possibility of arbitrary SQL code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including admin usernames and passwords (as demonstrated in the provided exploit code).
*   **Potential for full compromise:** Depending on the database user permissions and the overall system configuration, an attacker might be able to further compromise the server, execute arbitrary code, modify data or deny service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted URL by manipulating the `pgm` parameter in a GET request to the `index.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific network position or authentication is mentioned, meaning remote exploitation over the internet should be possible if the application is accessible.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `partners_admin` table. It attempts to extract the `admin_login` and `admin_password` columns.
*   The `concat_ws(0x3a,admin_login,admin_password)` part concatenates the username and password with a colon separator.
*   The attacker uses the `joinstatus=pgmwise` parameter in combination with the `pgm` parameter to trigger the vulnerability.
* The attacker uses a negative number `-1` in order to force the UNION statement to execute.
