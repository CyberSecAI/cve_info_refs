# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

SUSE Security Summary Report

Date: Fri, 26 Sep 2008 16:00:00 +0000

- xgl

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds:

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- xgl
xgl suffered from several Xorg security problems as it contains
copies of the code (CVE-2008-2360, CVE-2008-2361, CVE-2008-2362,
CVE-2008-1379, CVE-2008-1377)
- WebKitGtk,libQtWebKit4
A flaw in the CSS loader of the WebKit engine could crash programs
and potentially allowed execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2008-3632).
- libopensc2
The previous opensc security update (CVE-2008-2235) was
insufficient, therefore packages with additional fixes have been
released (CVE-2008-3972)
- pam\_mount
pam\_mount allowed users to mount arbitrary devices to any directory
when the 'luserconf' configuration directive was set (CVE-2008-3970).
- bluez-libs
Missing length checks in bluez-libs could cause a buffer overflow in
Bluetooth applications. Malicious bluetooth devices could
potentially exploit that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-2374).
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
none
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

provided that the advisory is not modified in any way. In particular, the
clear text signature should show proof of the authenticity of the text.

About the security issue
========================

During code refactoring approximately 3 years ago, are affected), some
sanity/security checks for user-defined volumes were, probably
accidentally, removed. This allowed users to mount arbitrary sources
onto arbitrary directories; normally, they can only do so when they own
the mountpoint, and own the source, or the source is a non-local mount.

Versions 0.10 through 0.45 are affected. The correct behavior enforcing
these restrictions has been restored in 0.47. By default, user-defined
configuration files are disabled in pam_mount.conf.xml anyway, and it is
believed that luserconf-enabled systems are not numerous, so this is
only a minor issue. It is advised to upgrade the affected systems, or as
a workaround, disable user-defined volumes by commenting out the
<luserconf ...> configuration item.

Use CVE-2008-3970 for this meta-fix.
