```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Insecure cookie handling in Maian Recipe v1.2. The application only checks for the existence of a cookie, and not its content, for authentication purposes.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Authentication bypass due to insufficient cookie validation.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can gain administrative access to the application.
- Attack vectors: By crafting and setting a specific cookie value via javascript.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to execute javascript in the context of the victim's browser or set the cookie value directly.
