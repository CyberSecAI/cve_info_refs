       "text": "## Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-052 - Critical\n\n### Vulnerabilities in GDI+ Could Allow Remote Code Execution (954593)\n\nThis security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows GDI+. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted image file using affected software or browsed a Web site that contains specially crafted content.\n\nThis security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008, Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 when installed on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Microsoft Digital Image Suite 2006, SQL Server 2000 Reporting Services Service Pack 2, all supported editions of SQL Server 2005, Microsoft Report Viewer 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package, and Microsoft Report Viewer 2008 Redistributable Package.\n\nThis security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Office XP; Microsoft Office 2003; all affected Office Viewer software for Microsoft Office 2003; 2007 Microsoft Office System; all affected Office Viewer software for 2007 Microsoft Office System; Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Expression Web, Microsoft Expression Web 2, Microsoft Office Groove 2007 and Microsoft Office Groove 2007 Service Pack 1; Microsoft Office Project 2002; Microsoft Visio 2002; Microsoft Office PowerPoint Viewer 2003; Microsoft Works 8; and Microsoft Forefront Client Security 1.0.\n\nThe security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that GDI+ handles viewing malformed images.\n\n#### GDI+ WMF Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3014\n\nA remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI+ allocates memory for WMF image files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted WMF image file or browses to a Web site that contains specially crafted content. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.\n\n##### Mitigating Factors for GDI+ WMF Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3014\n*   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user.\n*   The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file.\n* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.\n*   By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039).\n\n##### Workarounds for GDI+ WMF Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3014\n* **Restrict access to gdiplus.dll**\n* **Unregister vgx.dll**\n* **Prevent RSClientPrint from running in Internet Explorer**\n\n##### FAQ for GDI+ WMF Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3014\n**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**\nThis is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.\n\n**What causes the vulnerability?**\nThe vulnerability is caused by a buffer overrun when GDI+ improperly allocates memory when parsing a specially crafted WMF image file.\n\n**What is theWindows Metafile (WMF) image format?**\nA WMF image is a 16-bit metafile format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. It is optimized for the Windows operating system.\n\n**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system.\n\n**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**\nThis vulnerability requires that a user open or view a specially crafted image file.\n\nIn an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted EMF image file or an Office document with a specially-crafted EMF image file embedded in it to the user and by convincing the user to open the document or view the e-mail containing the specially crafted image file.\n\nIn a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**\nThis vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail messages, visiting Web sites, or opening files from a network share for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail messages are read, where Internet Explorer is used frequently, or where users have network share access, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.\n\n**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**\nYes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039).\n\n**What does the update do?**\nThe update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that GDI+ allocates memory for WMF image files.\n\n**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**\nNo. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.\n\n**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**\nNo. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued."
