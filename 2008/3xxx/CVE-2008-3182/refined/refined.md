{
  "CVE-2008-3182": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper boundary checks on user-supplied input when processing .m3u playlist files.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow (CWE-119)"
      ],
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution within the context of the application. Failed exploitation attempts may result in a denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted .m3u file, which is then imported and verified by the vulnerable application. This action triggers the buffer overflow.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to create a malicious .m3u file and convince the victim to import this file using the vulnerable application. This attack can be considered local since the malicious .m3u file has to be present on the system running the application."
