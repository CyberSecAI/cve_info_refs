Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3415:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `common.php` file of CMScout version 2.05. The `bit` parameter within this file is susceptible to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application fails to properly sanitize the input provided to the `bit` parameter, allowing an attacker to include local files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, database credentials, and source code.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious file (e.g., an image with embedded shell code) as an avatar and then using the LFI vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. The attacker can execute commands on the server using the `cmd` parameter.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `common.php` script, specifically targeting the `bit` parameter.
*   **File Path Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `bit` parameter to include file paths on the server. The use of null byte termination (`%00`) is a key part of this manipulation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, so no specific local network access is required.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of how to craft an HTTP GET request with URL parameters.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attack URL structure is: `http://example/common.php?bit=file.type%00`. This uses a null byte termination to truncate the file extension, allowing the inclusion of files other than the intended types.
*   A more specific attack example involving code execution via avatar upload is: `http://Example/common.php?bit=avatars/0254d5d7v15d_sd5e5550053.jpg%00&cmd=ls`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit is relatively straightforward and requires no authentication.
*   The vulnerability is considered to have a high exploitability subscore due to its easy nature.
