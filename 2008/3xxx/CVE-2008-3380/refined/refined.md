Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3380

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `rs` parameter of the `ajaxp_backend.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, it's a reflected XSS vulnerability since the injected script is reflected back to the user within the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page viewed by other users. This injected script can be used for various malicious activities such as:
- Stealing cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking.
- Redirecting the user to phishing sites.
- Defacing the website.
- Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `ajaxp_backend.php` script. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `rs` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious HTTP POST request.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, making it easier for an attacker to exploit.
- The attacker has to somehow lure the user into executing the crafted request.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `rs` in `ajaxp_backend.php`.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request with malicious JavaScript code in the `rs` parameter, e.g., `<script>alert('xss')</script>`.
- The provided proof of concept HTML code shows how an attacker could craft such a request:
```html
<html>
<head></head>
<body onLoad=javascript:document.form.submit()>
<form action="http://example/zomplog/ajaxp_backend.php"
method="POST" name="form">
<input type="hidden" name="rs" value="" <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>">
</form>
</body>
</html>
```

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Easybookmarker 40tr.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" risk.
- The CVSS base score is 4.3/10, with exploitability subscore 8.6 and impact subscore 2.9.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
