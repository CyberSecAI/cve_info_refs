- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Avaya SIP Enablement Services (SES) server does not block core router updates after an invalid login attempt. Additionally, login credentials are shown in alarm and system logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Lack of proper login failure handling, allowing core router updates despite invalid login attempts.
    - Storage of login and password in alarm and system logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - The SES server could become unusable for handling SIP messages.
    - The system could allow unwanted system control.
    - Exposure of login credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access via management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to attempt an invalid login and then exploit the ability to execute system updates due to the lack of a block on core router updates. Also an attacker with access to system logs can view the login credentials.
