Remote Administration Login Failure Vulnerabilities in Avaya SIP Enablement Services Server

Original Release Date: August 19, 2008

Last Revised: August 19, 2008

Number: ASA-2008-347

Risk Level: High

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

A flaw was found in the SIP Enablement Services (SES) servers handling
of remote management login failures. An invalid login does not block
Core router updates which allows the remote system to execute system
updates. This could cause the SES server to become unusable for handling
SIP messages and/or allow unwanted system control.

A flaw was found in the SES servers handling of alarms generated by
remote management login failures. Both the login and password are shown
in the alarm and system logs.
