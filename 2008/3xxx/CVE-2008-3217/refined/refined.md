{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "PowerDNS recursor versions prior to 3.1.6 used a weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) for source port selection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of weak PRNG for source port randomization."
      ],
      "impact": "Predictable source ports could allow an attacker to more easily spoof DNS responses, potentially leading to cache poisoning or other attacks.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker could spoof a DNS response from an authoritative server."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "The attacker must be able to send spoofed DNS responses to a vulnerable PowerDNS recursor instance.",
        "The attacker needs to know or predict the source port used by the recursor."
      ],
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability was initially believed to be present in versions before 3.1.5, but was later corrected to be before 3.1.6."
