      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_71e12c61_20250124_162334.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is present in the `categories_portal.php` script. This script is vulnerable to SQL injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Blind SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user passwords, by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability. The exploit provided extracts the MD5 hash of the first user's password.",
       "attack_vector": "The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a modified `cat_id` parameter. Specifically, the exploit targets the `categories_portal.php` script by injecting SQL code within the `cat_id` parameter.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
      "additional_information": "The provided exploit is a Perl script that demonstrates how to extract the MD5 hash of a user password via the SQL injection vulnerability. The script iterates through each character of the password, using a series of SQL queries to determine its value."

      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_71e12c61_20250124_162334.html",
       "root_cause": "The `members.php` script is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS)",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `PageNo` parameter in the URL of `members.php` with malicious JavaScript code.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to entice a user to click a specially crafted link, or inject the malicious script into a vulnerable area, which will then be executed within the context of the user's browser session."
