Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-3487:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `profile.php` script of phpAuction GPL Enhanced version 2.51. Specifically, the `id` parameter is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. By manipulating the `id` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords. The provided exploit specifically targets the `PHPAUCTION_adminusers` table, aiming to extract administrator credentials.
- **Complete Compromise:** By obtaining administrator credentials, the attacker could gain full control over the application and potentially the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `profile.php` script. The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique. It injects the SQL query `union+select+1,concat(username,0x3e,password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23+FROM+PHPAUCTION_adminusers--` to extract user and password data.

**Additional Notes**
- The exploit uses `0x3e` which is the hex representation of the '>' character, used as a delimiter between username and password for easier extraction of credentials.
- The exploit targets the administrative credentials, which would allow full control over the application if obtained.
- The provided example URL includes a live demo that can be tested.
