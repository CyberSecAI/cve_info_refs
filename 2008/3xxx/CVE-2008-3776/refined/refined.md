Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* Insufficient control of user inputs in Fujitsu Web-Based Admin View.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* Directory Traversal vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to navigate outside of the intended webroot directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*  An attacker can view arbitrary local files within the context of the web server. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, configuration files, or even system credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
*  By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable application. The attack uses ".." sequences in the URL to traverse directories outside of the webroot.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No special privileges or prior knowledge of the system is mentioned.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable version is specified as 2.1.2 on Solaris, but the advisory notes that other versions may be vulnerable.
*   A sample HTTP request is provided demonstrating the attack vector. This request includes multiple ".." sequences to traverse directories and target the `/etc/passwd` file.
