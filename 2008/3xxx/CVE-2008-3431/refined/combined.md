  Sun xVM VirtualBox Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

*Advisory Information*

Title: Sun xVM VirtualBox Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2008-0716
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/content/virtualbox-privilege-escalation-vulnerability

Date published: 2008-08-04
Date of last update: 2008-08-04
Vendors contacted: Sun Microsystems
Release mode: Coordinated release

*Vulnerability Information*

Class: Insufficient input validation

Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
Bugtraq ID: 30481
CVE Name: CVE-2008-3431

*Vulnerability Description*

Virtualization technologies allow users to run different operating
systems simultaneously on top of the same set of underlying physical

hardware. This provides several benefits to end users and organizations,
including efficiency gains in the use of hardware resources, reduction
of operational costs, dynamic re-allocation of computing resources and

rapid deployment and configuration of software development and testing
environments.

VirtualBox is an open source virtualization technology project
originally developed by Innotek, a software company based in Germany.

In February 2008 Sun Microsystems announced the acquisition of Innotek
[1] and VirtualBox was integrated into Sun's xVM family of
virtualization technologies. In May 2008, Sun Microsystems announced
that the number of downloads of the open source VirtualBox software

package passed the five million mark [2].

When used on a Windows Host Operating System VirtualBox installs a
kernel driver ('VBoxDrv.sys') to control virtualization of guest
Operating Systems.

An input validation vulnerability was discovered within VirtualBox's
'VBoxDrv.sys' driver that could allow an attacker, with local but
un-privileged access to a host where VirtualBox is installed, to execute

arbitrary code within the kernel of the Windows host operating system
and to gain complete control of a vulnerable computer system.

*Vulnerable Packages*

. Sun xVM VirtualBox 1.6.2.

. Sun xVM VirtualBox 1.6.0.
. This issue only occurs in the Microsoft Windows versions of xVM
VirtualBox.

*Non-vulnerable Packages*

. Sun xVM VirtualBox 1.6.4 (for Microsoft Windows)

*Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

No workarounds exist for this issue. A security bulletin from the vendor
that describes this issue is available here:
http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-66-240095-1.

*Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Anibal Sacco from
the CORE IMPACT Exploit Writing Team (EWT) at Core Security Technologies.

*Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

When the VirtualBox package is installed on a host the 'VBoxDrv.sys'
driver is loaded on the machine. This driver allows any unprivileged
user to open the device '\\.\VBoxDrv' and issue IOCTLs with a buffering

mode of METHOD_NEITHER without any kind of validation. This allows
untrusted user mode code to pass arbitrary kernel addresses as arguments
to the driver.

With specially constructed input, a malicious user can use functionality

within the driver to patch kernel addresses and execute arbitrary code
in kernel mode. When handling IOCTLs a communication method must be
pre-defined between the user-mode application and the driver module. The

selected method will determine how the I/O Manager manipulates memory
buffers used in the communication.

The 'METHOD_NEITHER' is a very dangerous method because the pointer
passed to 'DeviceIoControl' as input or output buffer will be sent

directly to the driver, thus transferring it the responsibility of doing
the proper checks to validate the addresses sent from user mode.

The 'VBoxDrv.sys' driver uses the 'METHOD_NEITHER' communication method

when handling IOCTLs request and does not validate properly the buffer
sent in the Irp object allowing an attacker to write to any memory
address in the kernel-mode.

Let's see the bug on the source. This is the function used to handle the

IOCTL requests at 'SUPDrv-win.cpp'.

/-----------

  NTSTATUS _stdcall VBoxDrvNtDeviceControl(PDEVICE_OBJECT pDevObj, PIRP
pIrp)
  {
    PSUPDRVDEVEXT       pDevExt = (PSUPDRVDEVEXT)pDevObj->DeviceExtension;

    PIO_STACK_LOCATION  pStack = IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation(pIrp);
    PSUPDRVSESSION      pSession =
(PSUPDRVSESSION)pStack->FileObject->FsContext;

    /*
    * Deal with the two high-speed IOCtl that takes it's arguments from

    * the session and iCmd, and only returns a VBox status code.
    */
    ULONG ulCmd = pStack->Parameters.DeviceIoControl.IoControlCode;
    if (    ulCmd == SUP_IOCTL_FAST_DO_RAW_RUN
(1)   ||  ulCmd == SUP_IOCTL_FAST_DO_HWACC_RUN

      ||  ulCmd == SUP_IOCTL_FAST_DO_NOP)
    {
      KIRQL oldIrql;
      int   rc;

      /* Raise the IRQL to DISPATCH_LEVEl to prevent Windows from
rescheduling us to another CPU/core. */
      Assert(KeGetCurrentIrql() <= DISPATCH_LEVEL);

      KeRaiseIrql(DISPATCH_LEVEL, &oldIrql);
(2)   rc = supdrvIOCtlFast(ulCmd, pDevExt, pSession);
      KeLowerIrql(oldIrql);

      /* Complete the I/O request. */
      NTSTATUS rcNt = pIrp->IoStatus.Status = STATUS_SUCCESS;

      pIrp->IoStatus.Information = sizeof(rc);
      __try
      {
(3)     *(int *)pIrp->UserBuffer = rc;
      }
      __except(EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER)
      {
        rcNt = pIrp->IoStatus.Status = GetExceptionCode();

        dprintf(("VBoxSupDrvDeviceContorl: Exception Code %#x\n", rcNt));
      }
      IoCompleteRequest(pIrp, IO_NO_INCREMENT);
      return rcNt;
    }

    return VBoxDrvNtDeviceControlSlow(pDevExt, pSession, pIrp, pStack);

  }

- -----------/

At (1), we can see the sentence checking the IOCTL code. The constants
use are defined at 'SUPDrvIOC.h' in this way:

/-----------

#define SUP_IOCTL_FAST_DO_RAW_RUN               SUP_CTL_CODE_FAST(64)

/** Fast path IOCtl: VMMR0_DO_HWACC_RUN */
#define SUP_IOCTL_FAST_DO_HWACC_RUN             SUP_CTL_CODE_FAST(65)
/** Just a NOP call for profiling the latency of a fast ioctl call to
VMMR0. */
#define SUP_IOCTL_FAST_DO_NOP                   SUP_CTL_CODE_FAST(66)

- -----------/

With the macro 'SUP_CTL_CODE_FAST()' defined in the same file:

/-----------

#define SUP_CTL_CODE_FAST(Function) CTL_CODE(FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN,
(Function)
                                       | SUP_IOCTL_FLAG, METHOD_NEITHER,

                                         FILE_WRITE_ACCESS)

- -----------/

Now we know that the communication method used will be 'METHOD_NEITHER '
(this could also be easily seen by looking at the resulting IOCTL code

in the disassembled binary).

Then at (2) the value returned by 'supdrvIOCtlFast()' is saved in 'rc'
and this is where the problem starts because at (3), the value in 'rc'
is written directly to the buffer pointer sent from usermode without any

check to validate that it is really pointing to an usermode address or
even a valid one.

In this scenario, it is possible to feed the IOCTL with kernel addresses
to write the value returned by 'supdrvIOCtlFast()' ANY address in kernel

space memory as many times as necessary to modify kernel code or kernel
pointers to subsequently get code execution in ring 0 context (that
means, with system privileges).

This is the Proof of Concept I have made to trigger and show the

vulnerability. This will generate a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) trying
to write to an unpaged kernel mode address (0x80808080) but any other
arbitrary address could be used.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
