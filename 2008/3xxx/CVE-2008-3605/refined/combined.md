\* Important Terms and Offer Details:

.

*+*Subscription, Free Trial, Pricing and Automatic Renewal Terms:

*-*Subscription, Free Trial, Pricing and Automatic Renewal Terms:

* The amount you are charged upon purchase is the price of the first term of your subscription. The length of your first term depends on your purchase selection. 30 days before your first term is expired, your subscription will be automatically renewed on an annual basis and you will be charged the renewal subscription price in effect at the time of your renewal, until you cancel (Vermont residents must opt-in to auto-renewal.)
* Unless otherwise stated, if a savings amount is shown, it describes the difference between the introductory first term price (available only to customers without an existing McAfee subscription) and the renewal subscription price (e.g., first term price vs. each year thereafter).
* Pricing is subject to change. If the renewal price changes, we will notify you in advance so you always know what’s going on.
* You can cancel your subscription or change your auto-renewal settings any time after purchase from your [My Account](https://home.mcafee.com/Secure/MyAccount/DashBoard.aspx?culture=en-us "My Account") page. To learn more, [click here](https://service.mcafee.com/?locale=en-US&articleId=TS102648&fromSearch=true&page=shell&shell=article-view "Article").
* You will be provided a full refund upon request, by contacting [Customer Support](https://service.mcafee.com "Support") within 30 days of your initial purchase or 60 days of auto-renewal.
* Your subscription is subject to our [License Agreement](/en-us/consumer-support/policy/legal.html#eula "Licence") and [Privacy Notice](/en-us/consumer-support/policy/legal.html "Privacy"). Subscriptions covering "all" devices are limited to supported devices that you own. Product features may be added, changed or removed during the subscription term.  Not all features may be available on all devices.  See [System Requirements](/en-us/consumer-support/help/system-requirement.html "System Requirements") for additional information.
* **Free Trial Terms:** At the end of your trial period you will be charged $39.99 for the first term. After the first term, you will be automatically renewed at the renewal price (currently $109.99/yr). We will charge you 7-days before renewal. You can cancel at any time before you are charged. ​
* Plans with unlimited device protection cover only household devices that you own for personal, non-commercial use, and are subject to our fair use policy. If you have an issue adding a device, please contact [Customer Support](https://www.mcafee.com/support "support").

*+*\*\*Free Benefits With Auto-Renewal:

Not all benefits are offered in all locations or for all product subscriptions.  [System Requirements](/en-us/consumer-support/help/system-requirement.html "System Requirements") apply.   Turning off auto-renewal terminates your eligibility for these additional benefits.
* **Virus Protection Pledge (VPP):** If we cannot remove a virus from your supported device we’ll refund you the amount you paid for your current term subscription.  The refund does not apply to any damage or loss caused by a virus.  You are responsible for backing up your data to prevent data loss.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
