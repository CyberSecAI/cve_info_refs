# POV-Ray: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200812-15**

POV-Ray includes a version of libpng that might allow for the execution of
arbitrary code when reading a specially crafted PNG file

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/povray** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.6.1-r4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.6.1-r4** |

### Background

POV-Ray is a well known open-source ray tracer.

### Description

POV-Ray uses a statically linked copy of libpng to view and output PNG
files. The version shipped with POV-Ray is vulnerable to CVE-2008-3964,
CVE-2008-1382, CVE-2006-3334, CVE-2006-0481, CVE-2004-0768. A bug in
POV-Ray's build system caused it to load the old version when your
installed copy of libpng was >=media-libs/libpng-1.2.10.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to load a specially crafted PNG file as
a texture, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All POV-Ray users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/povray-3.6.1-r4"
```

## 2. Avaya System Products using a Sun Microsystems Operating System:

Some Avaya system products are
delivered with an Operating System
from Sun Microsystems. Actions to be
taken on these products are described
below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CMS | R15 | Low | This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya IR | 3.0, 4.0 | Low | IR does not use or support libpng by default. Avaya will not test patch for use with IR. |

**Recommended Actions:**

Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

## libpng off-by-one vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#889484

Original Release Date: 2008-10-02 | Last Revised: 2008-10-02

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in libpng that may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.

### Description

| A vulnerability in the way libpng handles files that contain multiple zTXt chunks may cause a denial of service. This vulnerability is due to an off-by-one error introduced in the png\_push\_read\_zTXt() function in libpng-1.2.30/pngpread.c. According to the [PNG Development Group](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngnews.html):   *Gecko-based applications such as Firefox are not vulnerable because they contain a png\_set\_keep\_unknown\_chunks() call that causes the application to ignore the zTXt chunk.* Note that this issue affects libpng versions 1.0.38, 1.0.39, 1.2.30, 1.2.31, and libpng-1.4.0beta. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthorized attacker may be able to cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade** The [PNG Development Group](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngnews.html) has issued an upgrade to address this issue. See [libpng version 1.2.32](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) for more information. |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

PNG images with specially crafted zTXt chunks.
