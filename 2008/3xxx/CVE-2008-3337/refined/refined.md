Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-3337:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The PowerDNS Authoritative Server, prior to version 2.9.21.1, would drop DNS queries it considered malformed. This behavior, while not a direct security risk to the PowerDNS server itself, created a vulnerability in the broader DNS ecosystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Handling of Malformed Queries:** The core issue was that the server did not respond to specific invalid DNS queries.
- **Spoofing Vulnerability:** By dropping malformed queries, PowerDNS created a window where other resolving nameservers were more susceptible to accepting spoofed answers for domains hosted by vulnerable PowerDNS servers. This behavior facilitated simpler attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cache Poisoning:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject false DNS records into the cache of other resolving nameservers. This could redirect users to malicious websites or prevent access to legitimate services.
- **Facilitation of Spoofing:** The dropping of malformed queries, made it easier for attackers to perform cache poisoning attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability was exploitable remotely by sending specifically crafted DNS queries to a vulnerable PowerDNS server.
- **DNS Spoofing:** Attackers would need to spoof DNS responses to other nameservers when they are querying for records hosted on a vulnerable PowerDNS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft DNS queries which PowerDNS would consider malformed, and be able to send these to vulnerable servers.
- They also need to be able to spoof DNS responses to other nameservers to take advantage of the increased attack window.
- The attacker needs to know that the target domain is hosted on vulnerable PowerDNS servers.
