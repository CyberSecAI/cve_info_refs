Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3351
*   **Vulnerable Software:** Atom Photoblog 1.1.5b1
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of the `photoId` parameter in the `atomPhotoBlog.php` script.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL Injection. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `photoId` parameter, before using it in a database query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially allowing them to:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords).
    *   Modify data in the database.
    *   Potentially gain complete control of the database server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack is performed through the web interface by crafting a malicious URL.
    *   The attacker manipulates the `photoId` parameter in the URL of the `atomPhotoBlog.php` script.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
    *   No special privileges are needed, as the vulnerability can be exploited remotely by anyone with network access to the affected application.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit URL demonstrates the vulnerability:

```
www.Target.com/atomPhotoBlog.php?do=show&photoId=969696+union+select+0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,mail,pass,0+from+user
```

This URL shows how an attacker could inject an SQL `UNION SELECT` statement into the `photoId` parameter to extract the `mail` and `pass` columns from the `user` table. This confirms that the application does not properly sanitize the `photoId` parameter, allowing arbitrary SQL code to be executed on the database.
