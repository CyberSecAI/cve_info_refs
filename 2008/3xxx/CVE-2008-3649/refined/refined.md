Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-3649:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by SQL injection flaws present in two PHP files of the "Article Friendly" application: `categorydetail.php` and `authordetail.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input within the `Cat` parameter of `categorydetail.php` and the `autid` parameter of `authordetail.php`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially allowing them to:
    - Extract sensitive data (e.g., usernames, passwords, other confidential information)
    - Modify or delete data
    - Execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending malicious HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable files:
    - `categorydetail.php?Cat=[SQL Injection Payload]`
    - `authordetail.php?autid=[SQL Injection Payload]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable "Article Friendly" application.
- **Knowledge of SQL Syntax:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL syntax and injection techniques to craft the malicious SQL payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- **Exploit Examples:**
  - `www.Target.com/authordetail.php?autid=-1'+union+select+0,0,0,CONCAT_WS(0x3a,@@version,user(),datbase),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0/*`
    - This example targets `authordetail.php` and attempts to extract the database version, current user, and database name.
  - `www.Target.com/categorydetail.php?Cat=1'+and+1=0+union+select+0,CONCAT_WS(0x3a,@@version,user(),datbase),0,0,0,0,0,0/*`
     - This example targets `categorydetail.php` and attempts to extract the database version, current user, and database name.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content also mentions that the exploit was originally published on milw0rm.com (now Exploit-DB) with EDB-ID 6167.
- The exploit targets two different files, `authordetail.php` and `categorydetail.php` within "Article Friendly".
- The content indicates that the vulnerability is present in both the Pro and Standard versions of "Article Friendly"
