Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2008-3219:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `filter_xss_admin` function in Drupal versions prior to 5.8 and 6.3 does not properly prevent the use of the `object` HTML tag in administrator input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection:** The vulnerability stems from an inadequate mechanism for sanitizing administrator input, specifically failing to block the `object` tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unknown impact:**  The exact impact is not fully defined, but it is related to an insufficient XSS protection mechanism. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious script or HTML.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves injecting the `object` HTML tag through administrator input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious tag through an administrative interface of Drupal. This implies the attacker may need administrative privileges or the ability to manipulate administrator inputs.

**Summary**
CVE-2008-3219 is related to a failure in Drupal to sanitize admin input. Specifically, the object tag is not filtered correctly, and could be used for XSS attacks.
