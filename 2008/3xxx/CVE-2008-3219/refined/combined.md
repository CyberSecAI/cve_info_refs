How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=454849#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-07-10 07:03:08 UTC  ``` Drupal security team released an advisory describing multiple security issues affecting Drupal 5.x and 6.x - SA-2008-044:    <http://drupal.org/node/280571>  Advisory includes: - cross site scripting issues - cross site request forgeries - session fixation issues - SQL injection  Fixed in upstream versions: 5.8 and 6.3  Upstream patches for 5.7/6.2: <http://drupal.org/files/sa-2008-044/SA-2008-044-5.7.patch> <http://drupal.org/files/sa-2008-044/SA-2008-044-6.2.patch>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=454849#c3)  Fedora Update System    2008-07-15 12:17:18 UTC  ``` drupal-6.3-1.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=454849#c4)  Fedora Update System    2008-07-15 12:19:06 UTC  ``` drupal-5.8-1.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=454849#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2008-07-21 08:28:34 UTC  ``` CVE-2008-3218: Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Drupal 6.x before 6.3 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors related to (1) free tagging taxonomy terms, which are not properly handled on node preview pages, and (2) unspecified OpenID values.  CVE-2008-3219: The Drupal filter_xss_admin function in 5.x before 5.8 and 6.x before 6.3 does not "prevent use of the object HTML tag in administrator input," which has unknown impact and attack vectors, probably related to an insufficient cross-site scripting (XSS) protection mechanism.  CVE-2008-3220: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Drupal 5.x before 5.8 and 6.x before 6.3 allows remote attackers to perform administrative actions via vectors involving deletion of "translated strings."  CVE-2008-3221: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Drupal 6.x before 6.3 allows remote attackers to perform administrative actions via vectors involving deletion of OpenID identities.  CVE-2008-3222: Session fixation vulnerability in Drupal 5.x before 5.8 and 6.x before 6.3, when contributed modules "terminate the current request during a login event," allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions via unknown vectors.  CVE-2008-3223: SQL injection vulnerability in the Schema API in Drupal 6.x before 6.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via vectors related to "an inappropriate placeholder for 'numeric' fields."   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=454849#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2008-07-21 08:40:33 UTC  ``` Fedora Drupal packages were updated to 5.8 / 6.3 via:  <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F8/FEDORA-2008-6411> <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F9/FEDORA-2008-6415>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=454849#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2008-07-31 13:17:06 UTC  ``` The patch for [CVE-2008-3222](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-3222) was not included in drupal 5.8 tarballs, even though it was included in the SA-2008-044-5.7.patch referenced by SA-2008-044.  Upstream released SA-2008-046 / <http://drupal.org/node/286417> to correct this problem:    When contributed modules such as Workflow NG terminate the current request   during a login event, user module is not able to regenerate the user's   session. This may lead to a session fixation attack, when a malicious user   is able to control another users' initial session ID. As the session is not   regenerated, the malicious user may use the 'fixed' session ID after the   victim authenticates and will have the same access.    The advisory SA-2008-044 claims that this session fixation vulnerability was   fixed in Drupal 5.8 and 6.3. Unfortunately, Drupal 5.8 still contains this   vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=454849#c8)  Fedora Update System    2008-08-01 01:47:40 UTC  ``` drupal-5.9-1.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=454849#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2008-10-01 18:26:11 UTC  ``` Fix for [CVE-2008-3222](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-3222) was included in drupal 5.x as shipped in Fedora 8 in:  <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F8/FEDORA-2008-6916>   ``` |  |
