{
  "CVE-2008-3896": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Grub Legacy's pre-boot authentication routines do not sanitize the BIOS keyboard buffer after reading passwords.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Plain text password disclosure: The BIOS keyboard buffer is not flushed after reading the password, leaving it accessible in RAM.",
      "Security model bypass: A privileged attacker can manipulate the BIOS keyboard buffer to bypass Grub's password prompt."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": [
      "Plain text password disclosure: Passwords can be read from the BIOS keyboard buffer in RAM.",
      "Bypass boot time password prompts: An attacker can reboot the computer by manipulating the BIOS keyboard buffer with the correct password, even with full disk encryption."
    ],
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access: Exploitation requires the ability to read the memory location (0x40:0x1e) where the BIOS keyboard buffer is stored. This can be performed by an unprivileged user in some operating systems (e.g., Windows) and by root in most Unix-like systems.",
      "Manipulation of the BIOS keyboard buffer: An attacker with write access to the MBR and knowledge of the password can manipulate the buffer by using an intermediary bootloader before Grub to input password and bypass the Grub password prompt"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Local access to the system.",
      "Ability to read physical memory.",
      "For the bypass attack, ability to write to the MBR and knowledge of the Grub password."
    ],
      "Additional details": "The vulnerability affects Grub Legacy 0.97 and all previous versions. The BIOS keyboard buffer is located in RAM and can be accessed by reading physical memory at 0x40:0x1e."
