{
  "CVE-2008-3546": {
    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in git-core, the core of the git distributed revision control system. Improper path length limitations in git's diff and grep functions, in combination with maliciously crafted repositories or changes, could enable a stack buffer overflow and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of path lengths within the diff and grep functions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow due to insufficient path length validation."
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the git command.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted git repositories or changesets."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to entice a user to perform git commands such as `git diff` or `git grep` on a specially crafted repository.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability is present in the functions `diff_addremove()` and `diff_change()` when processing overly long repository path names."
  }
