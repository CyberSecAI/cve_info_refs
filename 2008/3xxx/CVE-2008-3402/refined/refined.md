{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `include` statement within `hioxupdate.php` and `hioxstats.php` files. The `$hm` parameter is directly used in the `include` statement without any sanitization or validation, allowing an attacker to control the included file path.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the web application and the underlying server, potentially allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive data, modify website content, or use the server for malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to `hioxupdate.php` and `hioxstats.php`",
      "Manipulating the `hm` parameter to include a remote file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only requires network access to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication or specific position on the network is necessary. The attack is remotely executable."
