```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` file of the WebBlizzard CMS, where the `page` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for SQL injection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Blind SQL Injection. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries through the `page` parameter in `index.php`. Because of the blind nature of the vulnerability, the attacker has to use time-based or boolean-based techniques to extract data.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords. In this case, the exploit targets the credentials of an admin user.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `index.php` file, by manipulating the `page` parameter, to inject SQL code.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific position is mentioned in the exploit.
