Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-3635:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the parsing of QuickTime files that use the Indeo video codec, specifically version 3.2.
- A lack of proper bounds checking within QuickTimeInternetExtras.qtx is the direct cause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The insufficient bounds checking leads to a buffer overflow on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- Application termination: In some cases, the vulnerability may simply lead to unexpected termination of the QuickTime application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious movie files: Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious movie files using the Indeo v3.2 codec.
- User interaction required: Exploitation requires the user to either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious movie file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious movie file to a user. This could be achieved by hosting it on a website or by sending it to the user as an attachment.
- The attacker needs to have an understanding of the vulnerability to craft a working exploit.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability specifically affects QuickTime on Windows (Vista, XP SP2, and SP3).
- The vulnerability does not affect systems running Mac OS X.
- Apple addressed the issue in QuickTime 7.5.5 by disabling the rendering of content encoded with any version of the Indeo codec.
- The vulnerability was reported to Apple by an anonymous researcher working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative.
