# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: [oCERT-2008-012] Horde, Popoon frameworks common input
	sanitization errors (XSS)

#2008-012 Horde, Popoon frameworks common input sanitization errors (XSS)

Two cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were reported in Horde
Framework. The first of which is that the Horde framework fails to properly
sanitize the filename of MIME attachments on received emails.  The second
vulnerability has a wider impact.

Horde relies on code similar to Popoon's externalinput.php to filter out
potential XSS attacks on user-supplied input.  This filter, and the original,
fail to fully sanitize user data.  In particular, this filter fails to
protect against '/'s acting as spaces in both Microsoft Internet Explorer and
Mozilla Firefox.

Patches have been made available for Horde:

* 3.1:
  <http://ocert.org/patches/2008-012/Text_Filter.31.patch>
* 3.2 - CVS HEAD:
  <http://ocert.org/patches/2008-012/MIME.patch>
  <http://ocert.org/patches/2008-012/Text_Filter.patch>

A replacement for externalinput.php is linked below as well.

Affected version:

Popoon (externalinput.php) <= r22196

Horde >= 3.2, <= 3.2.1 (both issues)
Horde >= 3.1, <  3.2   (XSS filter only)

(secondary affected versions)

Horde Groupware >= 1.0, <= 1.0.6 (XSS filter only)
Horde Groupware Webmail Edition >= 1.0, <= 1.0.7 (XSS filter only)
Horde Groupware >= 1.1, <= 1.1.2 (both issues)
Horde Groupware Webmail Edition >= 1.1, <= 1.1.2 (both issues)

**oCERT-2008-012 Horde, Popoon frameworks common input sanitization errors (XSS)**

**Description**:

Two cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were reported in Horde Framework.
The first of which is that the Horde framework fails to properly
sanitize the filename of MIME attachments on received emails. The second
vulnerability has a wider impact.

Horde relies on code similar to Popoon's externalinput.php to filter out
potential XSS attacks on user-supplied input. This filter, and the original,
fail to fully sanitize user data. In particular, this filter fails to
protect against '/'s acting as spaces in both Microsoft Internet Explorer and
Mozilla Firefox.

For example, the following snippet, supplied by the reporter, is treated as
valid by the browsers but safe by the filter: <body/onload=alert(/w00w00/)>

Patches have been made available for Horde:

\* 3.1: [Text\_Filter.31.patch](../patches/2008-012/Text_Filter.31.patch)

\* 3.2 - CVS HEAD: [MIME.patch](../patches/2008-012/MIME.patch), [Text\_Filter.patch](../patches/2008-012/Text_Filter.patch)

The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde
Application Framework version 3.2.2.

This is a security release that fixes unescaped output in the MIME library
(CVE-2008-3823), and further improves the XSS filter for HTML messages
(CVE-2008-3824). The unescaped output vulnerability can be triggered by
sending specially crafted e-mail messages to Horde users, if they use a Horde
mail client. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version.

Many thanks to Alexios Fakos for detecting these vulnerabilities, and oCERT
for notifying us.

The Horde Application Framework is a modular, general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP.  It provides an extensive array of classes that are
targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in developing modern web
applications.

The major changes compared to the Horde version H3 (3.2.1) are:
     * Fixed unescaped output in the MIME library.
     * Further improved the XSS filter for HTML.

The full list of changes (from version 3.2.1) can be viewed here:

<http://cvs.horde.org/diff.php/horde/docs/CHANGES?r1=1.515.2.413&r2=1.515.2.413.2.1&ty=h>

The Horde 3.2.2 distribution is available from the following locations:

     ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/horde-3.2.2.tar.gz
     <http://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/horde-3.2.2.tar.gz>

Patches against version 3.2.1 are available at:

     ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/patches/patch-horde-3.2.1-3.2.2.gz
     <http://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/patches/patch-horde-3.2.1-3.2.2.gz>

NOTE: Patches do not contain differences between files containing binary data.
These files will need to be updated via the distribution files.

#2008-012 Horde, Popoon frameworks common input sanitization errors (XSS)
Two cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were reported in Horde
Framework. The first of which is that the Horde framework fails to properly
sanitize the filename of MIME attachments on received emails. The second
vulnerability has a wider impact.
Horde relies on code similar to Popoon's externalinput.php to filter out
potential XSS attacks on user-supplied input. This filter, and the original,
fail to fully sanitize user data. In particular, this filter fails to
protect against '/'s acting as spaces in both Microsoft Internet Explorer and
Mozilla Firefox.
Patches have been made available for Horde:
\* 3.1:
http://ocert.org/patches/2008-012/Text\_Filter.31.patch
\* 3.2 - CVS HEAD:
http://ocert.org/patches/2008-012/MIME.patch
http://ocert.org/patches/2008-012/Text\_Filter.patch
A replacement for externalinput.php is linked below as well.
Affected version:
Popoon (externalinput.php) <= r22196
Horde >= 3.2, <= 3.2.1 (both issues)
Horde >= 3.1, < 3.2 (XSS filter only)

Horde Groupware >= 1.1, <= 1.1.2 (both issues)
Horde Groupware Webmail Edition >= 1.1, <= 1.1.2 (both issues)
Cake-PHP <= 1.2.0.7296 RC2
phpMyFAQ <= 2.5.0-dev (2008-08-18)
deluxeBB <= 1.2
emucms <= 0.3
SimpleSite <= 1.6.4
RevokeBB <= 1.0RC11\_normal
TPLN <= 2.9
Logicoder <= r27
phour <= r106
