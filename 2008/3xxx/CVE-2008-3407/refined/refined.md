Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3407:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application uses a simple cookie mechanism for authentication. Specifically, it sets a cookie named "login" to the value "right" upon successful login, indicating the user is authenticated.
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the `showcat.php` script via the `catid` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application uses a predictable cookie value ("right") for authentication. This value is easily guessable, and there is no proper session management with unique session identifiers.
*   **SQL Injection:** The application doesn't sanitize the `catid` parameter in `showcat.php` before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism by simply setting the "login" cookie to "right" using JavaScript, gaining unauthorized access to the administrative panel.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can perform arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Information disclosure (retrieving database data)
    *   Data manipulation (modifying or deleting database content)
    *   Full server compromise (in some cases where the database user has the necessary permissions and the attacker can inject arbitrary SQL)

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The attacker can use JavaScript to set the insecure cookie in the browser and bypass the authentication.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker can inject SQL code through the `catid` parameter in `showcat.php` using a crafted URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The attacker only needs to be able to execute JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable application.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and modify the `catid` parameter in `showcat.php`.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided exploit demonstrates both vulnerabilities: setting the cookie via javascript and SQL Injection using a `UNION SELECT` statement.
*   The vulnerable application is `phpLinkat` version 0.1.
*   The exploit was published on 2008-07-26.
*   The provided information is more detailed than the placeholder CVE description.
