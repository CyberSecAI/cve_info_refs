Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3602

**Vulnerable Software:** PHP-Ring Webring System v0.9.1

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the insecure handling of cookies by the PHP-Ring Webring System. Specifically, the application uses a cookie named "admin" to determine if a user is logged in as an administrator. This cookie does not contain any password or other security-related information. The script checks if the cookie is present and has a value, and it does not properly validate this cookie's authenticity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application relies on a simple cookie value check to determine admin access instead of a cryptographically signed or secure session token.
* **Lack of Authentication:** The cookie doesn't contain any sensitive information like a password hash, allowing anyone to forge it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the admin login process by creating a cookie with the name "admin" and setting its value to "1". This allows an unauthorized user to gain administrative access to the application.
* **Full Control:** With admin access, the attacker can manage the CMS, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Cookie Forging:** The attacker directly creates a cookie in the browser and sets its value, without needing any interaction with the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to set cookies in their web browser for the target domain. This can be done easily through browser developer tools or a simple JavaScript command.
* The attacker does not need to have any prior access to the admin panel or valid login credentials.

**Technical Details:**
The relevant code snippet from `/admin/wr_admin.php` is:

```php
$cookie = $_COOKIE[admin]; //check for cookie

if (($cookie == "" OR $_GET[stop] == 1 OR !is_admin($cookie)) && $_GET[op] != "login" && $_GET[op] != "logout") {
    include("../templates/wr_header.php");
    echo "Enter admin username and password to log in";
    ....
    ....
    ..
    } else {
function adminhome() // load admin settings
```

The exploit involves setting the `admin` cookie to `1` via javascript:
`javascript:document.cookie = "admin=1; path=/";`
