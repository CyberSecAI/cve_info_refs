Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3030:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the Efestech Shop v2.0 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `cat_id` parameter in the `urunler` command. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Queries:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code to query the database.
*   **Data Exposure:** This can lead to the exposure of sensitive data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the application with a manipulated `cat_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the malicious SQL injection payloads.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the `cmd=urunler` parameter is used along with a manipulated `cat_id` parameter.
*   The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the database. Example queries are:
    *   `http://target.com/path/?cmd=urunler&cat_id=30+union+select+0+from+ayarlar`
    *   `http://www.efestech.com/demo/shop/?cmd=urunler&cat_id=30+union+select+0+from+ayarlar`

**Vulnerable Tables**

The exploit lists several tables that can be accessed via the SQL injection:

*   `ayarlar`
*   `cat_eng`
*   `cat_tr`
*   `eng`
*   `lisans`
*   `mark_eng`
*   `mark_tr`
*   `product`
*   `subcat_eng`
*   `subcat_tr`
*  `tr`
*   `urun_resim`
