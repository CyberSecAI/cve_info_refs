Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3498

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `cid` parameter of the `com_netinvoice` Joomla component. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The component directly uses the `cid` parameter in an SQL query without sanitization or proper escaping, enabling the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords of the Joomla users (`jos_users` table is specifically mentioned).
- **Data Manipulation:** Depending on the database user's permissions, attackers might also be able to modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If an administrator's account is compromised, an attacker might gain complete control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable component.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `cid` parameter in the URL is the entry point for the injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker requires basic knowledge of web requests and SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable URL Pattern:** `http://localhost/[Joomla_Path]/index.php?option=com_netinvoice&action=orders&task=order&cid={SQL}`
- **Example Exploit:** `http://localhost/[Joomla_Path]/index.php?option=com_netinvoice&action=orders&task=order&cid=-1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,concat(username,0x3a,password),5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48 FROM jos_users--`
- The example uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to append the results of a query on the `jos_users` table to the original query results. This allows the attacker to read the usernames and passwords.
