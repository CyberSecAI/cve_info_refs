Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3317:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure cookie handling in Maian Search v1.1. The application's admin panel checks only for the *existence* of a specific cookie (`search_cookie`), and not its *content*.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application does not properly validate the contents of the `search_cookie`, making it susceptible to manipulation. Specifically, it checks if the cookie exists but not if it contains the correct authentication/authorization information.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  Due to the lack of cookie validation, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the admin panel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain access to the administrator panel by setting the cookie using a simple Javascript command without any required authentication.
*   **Full Application Control:**  The impact is full compromise of the application's admin functionality and the ability to modify the entire application and its data. The impact goes as far as the application's features allow an administrator to modify.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Client-side cookie manipulation:** The attacker crafts a cookie using JavaScript or other means. The exploit provided shows the simplest form with `javascript:document.cookie = "search_cookie=1; path=/";` as a way to set the malicious cookie in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute javascript on the victim's browser and then visit the admin panel.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the vulnerable system, as this vulnerability is related to the client-side handling of cookies.

**Summary:**

The core issue is that Maian Search v1.1 relies on the mere existence of a cookie for authentication and does not check the cookie's content.  This allows attackers to easily forge a cookie and gain unauthorized access to the admin panel, leading to full application control.
