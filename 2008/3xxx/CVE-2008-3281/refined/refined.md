Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2008-3281:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure in `libxml2` to properly detect and prevent recursive entity expansion within attribute values of XML documents. This can lead to an uncontrolled consumption of system resources. Specifically the recursion depth check was insufficient for attribute value cases, and that a better method to detect the issue would have been to count the number of entities replacement taking place while parsing a given document, and dropping parsing after half a million substitutions

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary vulnerability is the potential for a denial-of-service attack. By crafting a malicious XML document with nested entities within attributes, an attacker can force `libxml2` to recursively expand these entities, leading to high CPU and memory consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Successful exploitation results in the rapid consumption of CPU and memory resources, potentially causing the affected application to become unresponsive.
*  **Application Crash**: Due to memory exhaustion, applications processing the malformed XML could crash

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious XML Document:** The attack vector is primarily through the processing of a specially crafted XML document with nested entities within attributes

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply or entice a user or automated system into processing a malicious XML document with nested entity definitions within attributes.
* No special permissions are necessary to trigger this vulnerability.
* The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details from the Content**
*   Multiple sources confirm the vulnerability is related to recursive entity expansion. Some also identify Andreas Solberg as the discoverer.
*   Red Hat notes a fix for this involved a backported patch
*   The initial fix had issues, causing problems for applications like librsvg. Updated packages were released.
*   The fix for this issue in libxml2 2.7.0 (and later) included adding a flag to remove the hardcoded substitution limit (also there is a document depth limit).
*   Apple, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and Gentoo all issued security advisories and patches for this issue affecting a variety of their products.
*   Secunia also details the vulnerability impact, the affected products, and the fixes
*   VMWare also notes the issue impacts ESX packages.
