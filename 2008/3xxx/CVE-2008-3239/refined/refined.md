Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability lies in the `system/v_cron_proc.php` file of PHPizabi. The `writeLogEntry` function, used for logging, utilizes two configuration variables: `CRON_LOGFILE` and `LOCALE_LONG_DATE_TIME`. These variables are user-controllable, allowing an attacker to overwrite them and inject malicious code through the `date()` function.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Unvalidated user-controlled configuration variables.
- Improper use of the `date()` function with user-supplied format strings.
- Remote Code Execution vulnerability

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by injecting code through the `LOCALE_LONG_DATE_TIME` variable and then triggering the `writeLogEntry` function through the cron script which gets logged and executed. This can lead to complete server compromise.

Attack vectors:
- By manipulating the `CONF[CRON_LOGFILE]` and `CONF[LOCALE_LONG_DATE_TIME]` configuration parameters via HTTP GET/POST requests

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and needs to know the path to the vulnerable `v_cron_proc.php` file.
