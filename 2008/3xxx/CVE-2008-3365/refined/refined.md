Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2008-3365:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in the `index.php` script of Pixelpost photoblog version 1.7.1.
*   The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of the `language_full` variable.
*   The script uses the `$_GET['lang']` parameter to determine the language to load. It extracts a two-letter abbreviation and maps it to a language name through the `$PP_supp_lang` array.
*   The script then attempts to include a language file using the `language/lang-$language_full.php` path, allowing an attacker to manipulate the `$language_full` variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI, where an attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem by manipulating the `language_full` variable passed via HTTP GET request.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The script lacks proper sanitization of the `language_full` variable, allowing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to bypass intended restrictions.
*   **register_globals Dependency:** Successful exploitation requires the deprecated `register_globals` PHP setting to be enabled on the server which is a security risk by itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server by including them with the vulnerable script. This can potentially expose configuration files, source code, or any data accessible to the webserver.
*   **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While not explicitly stated, if an attacker manages to include a file containing malicious code within the context of PHP execution, this vulnerability could lead to Remote Code Execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request with the `lang` parameter to control the `language_full` variable.
*   **Path Traversal:** The attacker uses path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) in the `language_full` variable to navigate outside of the intended `language` directory.
*   **Null Byte Injection (Optional):** The example exploit uses a null byte `%00` to potentially truncate the filename after the arbitrary path. This is not always needed, and the path traversal itself is usually sufficient to trigger the LFI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Pixelpost application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any authentication, making it readily exploitable by any user that can reach the vulnerable URL.
*   **Server Configuration:** The `register_globals` setting on the server must be enabled for the exploit to work, which is typically disabled by default.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by the Digital Security Research Group [DSecRG].
*   A security patch was released by the vendor to fix this issue.
*   The advisory includes references to other security resources like SecurityFocus, milw0rm and Secunia advisories.
*   The content also includes a CVSS score and impact analysis.

In summary, this is a classic LFI vulnerability caused by a lack of input validation, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files on the server through the vulnerable Pixelpost application's `index.php` script when `register_globals` is enabled on the server.
