```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `pages_data.php` file in AuraCMS lacks proper access control, allowing unauthenticated users to perform arbitrary actions. Specifically, it does not properly check user roles, permissions, or access levels before allowing add, edit, or delete operations on page data within the database.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Missing access controls on `pages_data.php` leading to arbitrary data manipulation (add, edit, delete) in the database.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can arbitrarily add, edit, or delete page data within the AuraCMS database, potentially leading to defacement of the website, data loss, or injection of malicious content.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP GET/POST requests to the vulnerable `pages_data.php` file. The `action` parameter is used to specify the desired operation (add, edit, delete), while other parameters like `id`, `judul` (title) and `konten` (content) are sent via POST to manipulate the data.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable AuraCMS instance and does not require authentication to exploit this flaw.
