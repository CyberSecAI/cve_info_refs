How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

MyBB 1.4.1 Released - Maintenance and Security Update

| **[Ryan Gordon](https://community.mybb.com/user-2165.html)**  Offline   Former Staff    Posts: 16,264 Threads: 579 Joined: Oct 2005  Reputation:  [**39**](reputation.php?uid=2165)      **[#1](thread-36022-post-240262.html#pid240262 "MyBB 1.4.1 Released - Maintenance and Security Update")**   2008-08-17, 07:55 AM  (This post was last modified: 2008-08-17, 05:45 PM by [Ryan Gordon](https://community.mybb.com/user-2165.html).)   MyBB 1.4.1 is a general maintenance release and a security update to the MyBB 1.4 series. It fixes medium and low risk security vulnerabilities. We recommend everybody upgrades to this release immediately or patches their boards with the manual patching instructions below.  These vulnerabilities affect MyBB 1.4 and previous releases of MyBB 1.2 (including 1.2.14). Older versions of MyBB may also be affected. Please see the post below for upgrade instructions for 1.2.14.  WDZ is credited with the discovery of these vulnerabilities.   MyBB 1.4 to MyBB 1.4.1 Patch This patch is only for users running MyBB 1.4. If you are running an older version of MyBB then please download MyBB 1.4.1 from the MyBB site and update to it.  Please download the attached ZIP archive and replace the files in your forum directory with those from the ZIP archive.    .zip   [mybb\_1401\_changed\_files.zip](attachment.php?aid=10604 "2008-08-17, 05:45 PM") (Size: 631.5 KB / Downloads: 2,664)   If you wish to manually patch your board please download "mybb\_1400\_patches.txt" and follow the instructions in that file.    .txt   [mybb\_1400\_patches.txt](attachment.php?aid=10579 "2008-08-17, 07:47 AM") (Size: 2.93 KB / Downloads: 13,099)   For the upgrade of 1.4 to 1.4.1, the upgrader IS required -- this is so that templates may be updated. The manual patch set instructions only fix the medium risk vulnerabilities and is only made available to temporarily secure your forum until you have time to run the complete upgrade. We strongly recommend updating as soon as possible.  Reporting MyBB security vulnerabilities If you think you've found a vulnerability in MyBB, we advise you not to publicly post it on these forums or publicly release information about it elsewhere until we've had time to prepare and release a patch.  As always, you can send through security related messages on the MyBB website from the [Contact Us](http://www.mybboard.net/contact/) page.

Follow the general [[Wiki: Upgrading]](http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Upgrading "View the MyBB Wiki page for Upgrading") *(Broken link, head over to docs.mybb.com instead)* guide outlined on the MyBB Wiki to complete the upgrade process. You may download a ZIP archive of changed files in the first post.  You must then check for modified templates using the instructions in the next post.  Upgrading from other versions If you are upgrading from a version earlier than 1.2 then you will lose your custom themes, templates and language packs due to the number of changes between your version and the 1.2 series.  Before you attempt to upgrade, ensure you have a database backup and a copy of the files currently in use on your board. This is so you can revert back to your earlier version if you need to or something goes horribly wrong with the upgrade process.  Follow the general [[Wiki: Upgrading]](http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Upgrading "View the MyBB Wiki page for Upgrading") *(Broken link, head over to docs.mybb.com instead)* guide outlined on the MyBB Wiki to complete the upgrade process.

Maintenance and Security Update")**   2008-08-17, 07:57 AM   Theme and template changes Using the "Find Updated" link under the "Templates" page in the Admin CP you can find a list of the templates that have changed in this release that you've got one or more custom copies of.  After identifying changed templates using the tool you can either revert your custom template to the default (delete it) or use the "diff" tool to perform a difference analysis on your custom template and the default.  A revert for this release is not required so your custom version of the template should work perfectly fine.  Template changes Since MyBB 1.4 the following templates have had changes to them:  * search\_results\_threads\_thread * usercp\_subscriptions * modcp\_announcements\_new   Language file changes Since MyBB 1.4 the following language files have had changes to them:  * online.lang.php * search.lang.php * admin/tools\_maillogs.lang.php  Either update your language packs to include the changes in these files or revert to the standard English language pack.  Plugins Your MyBB 1.4.x plugins will work correctly with 1.4 without any updates.

For anyone who has downloaded the changed file package up to the point this post was made, and had ran the upgrade script, then you may have run into an issue where your setting groups were duplicated.

After you finish please delete it.  If you have lost your settings, then please PM me (Ryan Gordon) to receive a script to recover as much of the settings we can. If you have a backup then we strongly recommend you use that. If you require assistance with that then please make a post in the support forum.  We strongly apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you.

That post links to a patch file that gives a lot of clues:

<http://community.mybboard.net/attachment.php?aid=10579>

Looks like:

CVE-2008-3965
-------------
misc.php - SQL injection

CVE-2008-3966
-------------
usercp2.php, inc/functions_online.php,  moderation.php - XSS

CVE-2008-3967
-------------
moderation.php also has some privilege/permission checking (see
"is_moderator_by_tids")

These will be filled in later.
