Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-3479 from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Message Queuing Service (MSMQ) due to a flaw in parsing an RPC request to the MSMQ service. Specifically, a heap request can be controlled and later overflowed during an unchecked string copy operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** The core issue is a heap overflow vulnerability. This happens due to improper handling of RPC requests when copying strings without proper bounds checking, leading to overwriting of memory regions.
*   **Unchecked String Copy:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation and bounds checking when copying strings, allowing for an attacker to overflow a buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system remotely.
*   **Full System Control:** An attacker can gain complete control of the system under the SYSTEM context.
*   **Malicious Actions:** After gaining control, an attacker could install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted RPC Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted RPC request to the MSMQ service.
*   **Network-Based:** This is a network-based attack, where the attacker sends the malicious request over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate and can trigger the vulnerability remotely.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send RPC requests to the MSMQ service on the targeted system.
*  **Target system has Message Queuing Service enabled**: The MSMQ service has to be installed and enabled on the target Windows 2000 system to be vulnerable.

**Additional Information**
*   The vulnerability was not publicly known prior to the release of the security bulletin.
*   Microsoft had no reports of active exploitation before the bulletin's release.
*   The fix involves modifying the way the MSMQ service validates parameters to string APIs to prevent the overflow.
*   The vulnerability is specific to Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4. Other versions of Windows are not affected.
*   Workarounds include disabling the MSMQ service or blocking relevant network ports, however, these workarounds may affect functionality.
