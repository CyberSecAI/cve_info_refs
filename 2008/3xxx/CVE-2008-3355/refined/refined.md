Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3355

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the 'id' parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- The provided exploit demonstrates the ability to retrieve usernames and passwords from the `users` table, which can lead to unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a web request, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter in the `sitemap.xml.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the 'id' parameter in the URL.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability as the vulnerable parameter is in the publicly accessible sitemap.xml.php script.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `sitemap.xml.php`, when the `page` parameter is set to "photos", the vulnerable `id` parameter is used directly in an SQL query without proper sanitization.
- The provided exploit string is: `sitemap.xml.php?page=photos&id=999999 union select concat(username,0x3a,password),null from users --`
- This exploit string leverages a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique to extract data.
- Specifically, it concatenates `username`, a colon, and `password` from the `users` table.

**Affected Software:**
- Camera Life 2.6.2
