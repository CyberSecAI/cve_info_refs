{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The 'download.php' script in moziloCMS 1.10.1 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for arbitrary file downloads.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal: The script fails to properly filter the 'file' parameter, allowing attackers to specify paths outside of the intended directory.",
        "NULL Byte Injection: The exploit uses a null byte (%00) to truncate the file path, bypassing checks that might be in place"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files such as 'admin/conf/logindata.conf'. This can lead to the compromise of the CMS and potentially the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to 'download.php' with a crafted 'file' parameter."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable moziloCMS instance.",
        "magic_quotes_gpc needs to be off"
