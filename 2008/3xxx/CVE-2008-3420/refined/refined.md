Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3420

**Vulnerable Software:** Mobius Web Publishing Software version 1.4.4.1 and possibly earlier versions.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `browse.php` and `detail.php` files, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of `browse.php` and the `s` parameter of `detail.php` before using them in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials (usernames, email addresses, and passwords) by using `UNION SELECT` statements.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Complete compromise of the application:** Although not explicitly stated, SQL injection can allow for full control of the database and by extension the web server

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited via crafted HTTP GET requests to `browse.php` and `detail.php`, injecting SQL into vulnerable parameters.
*   Specifically:
    *   `browse.php?id=-1+UNION+SELECT+concat_ws(char(58),USID,EMAIL,SUPERSECRETPASSWORD,ADMIN)+from+Webusers+limit+0,1/*`
    *   `detail.php?t=exhibitions&type=exh&f=&s=-1+UNION+SELECT+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15/*`
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker does not need to be logged in, or have privileged access to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web server where the vulnerable Mobius application is hosted.
*   **Knowledge of SQL and URL Encoding:** An attacker needs some understanding of SQL syntax and be able to encode characters properly in the URL.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The default table name containing user information is `Webusers`.
*   The number of columns in the `detail.php` query can vary depending on the Mobius version.
*  A dork is provided for searching for vulnerable sites: "This website is powered by Mobius"
