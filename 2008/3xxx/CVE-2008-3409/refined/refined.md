      "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "A specific packet type in Unreal Tournament III contains a 16-bit field that specifies the size of the following data. If this field indicates a size larger than approximately 172 bytes, a memory corruption occurs. Additionally, if the specified data size exceeds the actual packet size, a NULL pointer exception occurs.",
