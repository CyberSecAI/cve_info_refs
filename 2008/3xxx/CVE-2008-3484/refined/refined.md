Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `cid` parameter of the `index.php` script when the `menu` parameter is set to `showcat`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `cid` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive database information, such as user credentials (usernames and passwords), as demonstrated in the exploit example provided.
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** The vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to data modification, deletion, or other malicious activities.
- **Full Database Compromise:** In a worst-case scenario, the attacker could gain complete control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `index.php` script.
- **Manipulated URL Parameter:** The attacker injects SQL code into the `cid` parameter within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable parameter and its location in the application to craft the malicious URL.
- **No Authentication Required**: The provided exploit does not mention authentication to be required.

**Exploit Example:**
- The exploit example provided in the content is:
`www.Target.com/index.php?menu=showcat&cid=-1+union+select+010,CONCAT_WS(0x3a,user,pass)MrSQL,010+from+admin--`
This example attempts to extract user and password information from the `admin` table by injecting SQL code into the `cid` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable application is identified as "eStoreAff V0.1"
- The vulnerability was discovered and published on 2008-08-01.
- The platform is PHP.
