Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-3480:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the Anzio Web Print Object (WePO) ActiveX control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The WePO ActiveX control does not properly validate the length of the "mainurl" parameter.
- When the "mainurl" parameter is processed, its value, received in OLECHAR format, is converted to a BSTR string using `SysAllocStringLen`, and a pointer to this BSTR string is stored on the stack.
- The "mainurl" value is then copied to a stack-based buffer using `REP MOVS DWORD` and `REP MOVS BYTE` instructions.
- This copy operation does not check the length of the data being copied and can cause a buffer overflow.
- A long "mainurl" value will overwrite the stack buffer, including the Structured Exception Handler (SEH).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the machine with the vulnerable WePO ActiveX component.
- The attacker can overwrite the SEH, redirecting the execution flow when an exception is triggered, allowing them to control the execution of arbitrary code.
- The exploit uses a technique called "Heap Spray" to load malicious code into the browser's heap.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious web page.
- This web page contains the vulnerable WePO ActiveX control with a specially crafted "mainurl" parameter.
- When a user visits the malicious web page, the browser loads the ActiveX control, and the overflow occurs, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- The vulnerability is client-side, as it requires the user to visit a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host a web page or inject the malicious code into a website that a user might visit.
- The victim's system must have the vulnerable Anzio Web Print Object ActiveX control installed.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit overwrites the SEH with a pointer to shellcode in the heap via a long "mainurl" parameter.
- The overflow occurs due to the `REP MOVS` operations not validating input length.
- The overflow is triggered when a BSTR string, created via `SysAllocStringLen`, is freed using `SysFreeString`, but the original pointer to the BSTR string is corrupted due to the overflow.
- The advisory provides a Python code example that generates an HTML file demonstrating the vulnerability by launching the Windows calculator.
- The exploit leverages a heap spray technique to store the shellcode in memory.
- The vulnerable versions include Anzio Web Print Object 3.2.19, 3.2.24, and Anzio Print Wizard Server/Personal Edition 3.2.19.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Anzio Web Print Object 3.2.30.

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory was published by Core Security Technologies on August 20, 2008, after coordinated disclosure.
- The vendor was notified in June 2008.
- The provided exploit code is designed for Windows XP with Internet Explorer, but can be adapted to other platforms.
