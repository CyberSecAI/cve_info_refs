  - Root cause of vulnerability: The `scrape.php` script in BtiTracker and xBtiTracker is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `info_hash` parameter.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection (CWE-89).
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
  - Attack vectors: By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `scrape.php` with a malicious `info_hash` parameter, an attacker can inject SQL code.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker can be remote and doesn't need prior authentication.
