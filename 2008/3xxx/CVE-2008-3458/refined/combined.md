### Description

Upload a mail merge template (e.g. letter.doc) into the CRM and logout, than try the following URL:

[​http://...your](http://...your) server.../test/wordtemplatedownload/letter.doc

You will able to download the template without logging in!

It seems that this security hole applies to all files stored in the test directory.

If you are opening [​http://.../vtigercrm/test/](http://.../vtigercrm/test/) you can see a listing of the folders that are there. I think every folder needs at least an index.php file which points back to the index.php in the vtigercrm root folder.

It is also possible to use a .htaccess file in the vtigercrm root folder with **Options -Indexes**. Then at least the directory listing is not possible anymore.

Hi Minnie,

.htaccess file was included in root folder of vtigercrm.

I had not set AllowOverride? All for this folder as I did have permissions to edit httpd.conf due to this I could not install vtiger!

Getting error:

/var/www/vtiger/.htaccess: Option Indexes not allowed here

Wanted to check if you can copy .htaccess files to folders where you did not want to

have files listed?

Since index.php is in root folder, other files and folder will not be listed.

But .htaccess should be added in folders like include, soap, test, upload, etc...

Let me know if need any more information.

Regards,

Prasad

Dear Prasad,

I've deleted the .htaccess file and **htaccess.txt** with the entries of .htaccess. To avoid directory structuring, you have to rename this htaccess.txt to .htaccess. For this a message stating that

***Rename htaccess.txt file to .htaccess to make public file access control.*** has been included in installation last step.Kindly refer the changeset[[11503]](/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/changeset/11503 "Fix for Huge security hole").

Thanks & Regards,

Minnie.

Refer: [​http://secunia.com/advisories/28370/](http://secunia.com/advisories/28370/)

Comments from secunia.com:

However, it seems like the fix only mitigates the possibility to list

the directory contents, so it's still possible for attackers to download

files by guessing their file names. Thus, we don't consider this to be

an appropriate patch.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
