  "CVE-2008-3276": {
    "description": "An integer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel dccp_setsockopt_change() function. The vulnerability exists due to a lack of sanitisation performed on a user-controlled integer value before the value is employed as the size argument of a memory allocation operation. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability to trigger a kernel panic on a victim's machine remotely.",
