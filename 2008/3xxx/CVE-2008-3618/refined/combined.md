## Apple Mac OS X file sharing allows authenticated remote access to files and directories

#### Vulnerability Note VU#126787

Original Release Date: 2008-09-16 | Last Revised: 2008-10-14

---

### Overview

Apple Mac OS X Leopard does not accurately reflect which files and directories are available via sharing.

### Description

| Apple Mac OS X Leopard (10.5.x) allows files and directories to be shared via a "Shared Folders" feature. OS X lists the folders that are shared using this feature, however the list is incomplete. An authenticated user can access his home directory remotely, and an authenticated administrator can remotely access the entire hard drive. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A system that is configured with Shared Folders enabled may be exposing more files and directories than expected. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue is addressed in Apple Mac OS X 10.5.5. This update causes OS X to more accurately explain which files and directories are shared. Please see the [Apple Advisory](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3137) for more details. |
