How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[![Security](https://www.geeklog.net/images/topics/security.png "Security")](https://www.geeklog.net/index.php/topic/Security)

A possible Cross-Site security vulnerability has been identified by NetAgent Co., Ltd. and JPCERT/CC Lt - http://jvn.jp/

The issue is with the forum search not correctly filtering out javascript. This new release addresses that issue and all sites are recommended to upgrade to this latest release which is now available in the [downloads](https://www.geeklog.net/downloads/index.php/866) area.

The upgrade steps are to replace the changed files and run the plugin upgrade.

### Forum Plugin Version 2.7.1 - Security Fix

Authored by: [Dirk](https://www.geeklog.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=408) on Sunday, July 20 2008 @ 04:21 pm EDT

I took the liberty and uploaded a collection of patches for the Forum plugin [here](http://www.geeklog.net/filemgmt/index.php?id=917).

These patches are "unoffcial" - if they break anything, it's my fault, not Blaine's. They have also been submitted to Blaine for inclusion in future versions, of course. And some of them (like displaying the thread subject in the site's title) have been in use on geeklog.net for a while.
