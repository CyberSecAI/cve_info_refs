  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter of the 'single.php' script before using it in an SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially allowing them to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, modify data, or even gain control of the database server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the 'single.php' script with a malicious 'id' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote, needing only the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
