    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-3638",
      "description": "The Java plug-in does not block applets from launching file:// URLs. Visiting a website containing a maliciously crafted Java applet may allow a remote attacker to launch local files, which may lead to arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of URLs.",
      "root_cause": "The Java plugin does not properly restrict the usage of 'file://' URLs by applets.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate URL handling within the Java plugin."
