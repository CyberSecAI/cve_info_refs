Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-3764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies within the PHP Live Helper application, specifically due to:

1.  **Unsanitized Input in `get()` Function:** The `get()` function in `global.php` does not sanitize parameters passed to it, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
2.  **Faulty `register_globals` Emulation:** The `libsecure.php` has faulty emulation code that allows for variable overwriting.
3.  **Use of `eval()` in `globalsoff.php`:** When `register_globals` is off, `globalsoff.php` uses `eval()` to create variables from GPC superglobals, which allows for remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** Unsanitized input in the `get()` function allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
2.  **Arbitrary Variable Overwriting:** The faulty `register_globals` emulation allows attackers to overwrite certain variables, particularly those in the database configuration file.
3.  **Remote Code Execution:** The use of `eval()` in `globalsoff.php` allows for the execution of arbitrary PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   Arbitrary access to database contents, including administrator credentials.
    *   Enumeration of admin passwords.
2.  **Arbitrary Variable Overwriting:**
    *   Allows for executing arbitrary code by overwriting the table prefix variable with an SQL query and the language file setting to include malicious code.
3.  **Remote Code Execution:**
    *   Direct execution of arbitrary PHP code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** Sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to vulnerable endpoints such as `/onlinestatus_html.php` with malicious SQL in parameters such as `dep`.
2.  **Arbitrary Variable Overwriting:** Crafting specific HTTP GET requests to overwrite database configuration and language file settings.
3.  **Remote Code Execution:** Crafting HTTP GET requests to `/chat.php` with the `rg=0` parameter and malicious PHP code in the `test` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PHP Live Helper instance.

**Additional Notes:**

* The advisory also mentions that by setting the `rg` parameter, the attacker can execute code regardless of the `register_globals` settings.
* The advisory provides example URLs to demonstrate each vulnerability.
* The vendor has released a patch for these issues.
