Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The EMC Centera Universal Access (CUA) module login form fails to sanitize user input in the username field, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper input validation and sanitization on the username field of the login form. This allows malicious SQL code to be passed to the database.
*   **Vulnerable SQL Query:** The backend SQL query used for authentication is susceptible to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and log in as an arbitrary user without knowing the password.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** With knowledge of user names (obtainable through the vulnerability itself, or by other means), an attacker can log in as a targeted user, including administrator accounts, gaining privileged access.
*   **Data Exposure:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided content, SQL injection vulnerabilities can often be leveraged to extract or modify data from the database beyond just user login information.
*   **System Access:** With administrator access, attackers can potentially gain complete control over the CUA module.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Login Form:** The primary attack vector is the username field of the CUA module login form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the CUA module's login page.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax, particularly the use of the `--` comment operator.
*   **User name discovery:** The attacker needs to either guess, or discover, valid user names.
**Specific Exploitation Method:**
*   An attacker can log in as the first user in the database by entering `' --` into the username field. This effectively comments out the password check.
*   After the first login, or by manually reviewing the user database entries, an attacker can login as any valid user by entering `valid_user_name' --` into the username field.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor was informed and released a patch (CUA 4.0.1 Patch 1) on June 30, 2008.
*   The vendor initially cooperated but stopped communicating after the patch release and did not release a public advisory.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Lars Heidelberg and Aaron Brown of adMERITia GmbH.
