adMERITia Vulnerability Report
Vulnerability Information

Vendor: EMC²
Product: Centera Universal Access
Version: CUA4.0_4735.p4

Vulnerability Type: Software Flaw

Vulnerability: SQL Injection

Impact: Attacker can bypass the authentication method and will be logged in as an \
arbitrary user. With specific knowledge of user names it is possible for an attacker \
to choose the user he/she wishes to log in as without a password.

Description: The user name field of the CUA Module Login does not sanitize user input \
allowing for an attacker to run arbitrary SQL code. Through "--" syntax it is \
possible to comment out the password check allowing an attacker to log in with the \
first available user name in the table. After performing this several times or by \
searching through the "Accounts" tab within the CUA Module an attacker can gather a \
list of all users. With this list an attacker can select an administrator account and \
log in with this by simply entering the user name followed by "--".

How Vulnerability can be reproduced:
        For an arbitrary account enter the following in the user field: ' --
        For a targeted account enter the following in the user field: \
valid_user_name' --

Release Information
Model: CENTERA_GEN_4
Software Version: CUA4.0_4735.p4
Operating System: Linux i386 V. 2.6.16.21-0.15_VCUA4_0_4735

Fix: (quote from the vendor)
"The remedy for the reported problems has been released on 30 June 2008 and is \
available on EMC Powerlink as CUA 4.0.1 Patch 1, under "Support -> Software \
Download"." Vendor URL: [www.emc.com](http://www.emc.com)

Vendor Status:
Vendor was informed of the problem, and was very cooperative in getting a patch \
developed for the problem. However, contact was broken off by the vendor after the \
relevant patch was released. The vendor has not yet published an advisory stating the \
reason for the latest patch or the discovered vulnerability in previous versions. \
This vulnerability was brought to the attention of the vendor on May 20, 2008 under \
the policy of responsible disclosure as documented at \
<http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/policy.html>. After cooperating on a patch the vendor did \
not respond to requests to release a public advisory. Therefore we have taken the \
initiative to alert the public through various security publications.
