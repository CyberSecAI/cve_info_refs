This issue can possibly be exploited by a local attacker to run arbitrary code as some other user if victim user can be convinced to run one of the affected frysk commands in an attacker controlled directory with specially crafted content.  Affected binaries: /usr/bin/f* (e.g. fcore, fcatch, fstack, fstep, ...) RPATH: @RPATH@   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=457939#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-08-05 16:32:16 UTC  ``` This issue does not affect current frysk-0.4-0 packages in Fedora.   ``` |  |
