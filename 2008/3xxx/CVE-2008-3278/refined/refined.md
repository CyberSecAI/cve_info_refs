{
  "Root cause": "The frysk packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 were built with an insecure RPATH in the ELF header of binaries, specifically within /usr/bin/f*.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Insecure RPATH configuration",
    "Use of relative path instead of absolute paths in RPATH"
  ],
  "Impact": "A local attacker could execute arbitrary code as another user by manipulating the library search path when a victim user runs one of the vulnerable frysk commands in a directory controlled by the attacker with specially crafted content.",
  "Attack vector": "Local access",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a directory where a victim user executes a vulnerable 'frysk' command and requires the ability to create malicious libraries within that directory. The user also needs to be convinced to execute one of the affected frysk commands."
