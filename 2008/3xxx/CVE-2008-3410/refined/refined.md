  "related": true,
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A 16-bit field in a specific type of network packet is used to determine the size of the following data. If this field specifies a size greater than 172 bytes, a memory corruption occurs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to insufficient bounds checking when handling network packets.",
      "Potential NULL pointer dereference if the specified data size exceeds the actual packet size."
    ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption can allow an attacker to control various registers, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. A NULL pointer dereference can crash the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a malformed network packet to the server"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server. No special privileges are required."
  },
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability was found in Unreal Tournament III (UT3) and America's Army 3. A crash caused by the NULL pointer dereference will often display the message \"Error: Attempted to multiply free a voice packet\" on the server. A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit was released at http://aluigi.org/poc/ut3mendo.zip."
