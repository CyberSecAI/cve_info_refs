Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Excel 2007 handles data connections to remote data sources. Specifically, when an .xlsx file is configured *not* to save credentials for the remote data source, Excel improperly fails to delete the password string, leading to potential credential exposure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Credential Handling:** Excel 2007 does not correctly remove the password string when instructed not to save remote data session passwords within an .xlsx file.
- **Credential Caching:** Despite explicit settings not to cache credentials, the password remains within the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain unauthorized access to a password-protected remote data source.
- **Data Breach:** This access allows the attacker to potentially view or manipulate sensitive data protected by the compromised credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File Distribution:** An attacker can distribute a specially crafted .xlsx file containing a data connection that improperly stores credentials.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince a user to open the malicious .xlsx file.
- **File Access:** The attacker needs access to an .xlsx file previously saved by an authorized user that contains a connection to a password-protected data source.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the .xlsx File:** The attacker must have access to a previously saved .xlsx file configured not to store credentials.
- **User Interaction (for initial exploit):** The user must open the crafted .xlsx file for the exploit to take place.
- **Knowledge of Target Data Source:** The attacker does not need to know the data source password, but needs to have access to the .xlsx file which contains the data connection.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability only affects .xlsx files. Files saved in the older Excel 97-2003 format (.xls) are not vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is specific to Excel 2007. Other versions, including older ones, are not directly affected by this particular flaw.
- Microsoft has provided workarounds, including editing the connections.xml within the .xlsx file, encrypting the document or saving it in the older Excel 97-2003 format.
- The issue was privately disclosed to Microsoft and no reports of in-the-wild exploitation were known at the time of the security bulletin publication.

In summary, CVE-2008-3003 allows an attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to a protected remote data source by improperly caching connection credentials within an Excel 2007 .xlsx file, even when configured not to save those credentials. This could result in elevation of privilege and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
