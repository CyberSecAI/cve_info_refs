## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Excel Could Allow Remote Code Execution (954066)

Published: August 12, 2008 | Updated: October 01, 2008

**Version:** 1.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves four privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Excel that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Excel file. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft Office Excel 2000 Service Pack 3 and rated Important for Excel 2002 Service Pack 3, Excel 2003 Service Pack 2, Excel 2003 Service Pack 3, Excel Viewer 2003, Excel Viewer 2003 Service Pack 3, Excel 2007, Excel 2007 Service Pack 1, Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats, Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats Service Pack 1, Microsoft Office Excel Viewer, and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

This security update addresses these vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Excel performs validations when opening Excel files. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

## Excel Indexing Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3004

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Excel processes index values when loading Excel files into memory. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by opening a specially crafted file which could be hosted on a Web site, or included as an e-mail attachment.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-3004](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3004).

#### Mitigating Factors for Excel Indexing Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3004

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and later editions of Office.

#### Workarounds for Excel Indexing Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3004

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality.

* **Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or un-trusted sources**

  The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) will protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

  To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office system installed.

  To install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  [Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&displaylang=en)

  MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:

  [https:](https://)

  To enable MOICE, change the registered handler for the .xls, .xlt, and .xla file formats. The following table describes the command to enable or to disable MOICE for the .xls, .xlt, and .xla file formats:

| Command to use to enable MOICE to be the registered handler | Command to use to disable MOICE as the registered handler |
| --- | --- |
| ASSOC .XLS=oice.excel.sheet | ASSOC .xls=Excel.Sheet.8 |
| ASSOC .XLT=oice.excel.template | ASSOC .xlt=Excel.Template |
| ASSOC .XLA=oice.excel.addin | ASSOC .xla=Excel.Addin |

For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

**Impact of Workaround:** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

  **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

  **For Office 2003**

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001

  **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2003, all of the latest Office 2003 security updates must be applied.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special Ã¢ÂÂexempt directoryÃ¢ÂÂ as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848) will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.

  **For 2007 Office system**

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001

  **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with the 2007 Microsoft Office system, all of the latest security updates for the 2007 Microsoft Office system must be applied.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special Ã¢ÂÂexempt directoryÃ¢ÂÂ as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848) will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.

  **How to Undo the Workaround:**

  **For Office 2003**

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000

  **For 2007 Office system**

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000
* Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ for Excel Indexing Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3004

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Excel does not perform sufficient validation of index values when loading Excel files into memory.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a malformed Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site and then convince them to open the file.

A Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 attack scenario is similar to a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host an Excel Services Web Part in Office SharePoint Server 2007 that is used to render (open) a specially crafted Excel file. An attacker would need permissions to create Excel Services Web Parts and upload Excel files, and then convince users to visit the Web site containing the web part.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Excel used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Excel validates index values when loading Excel files into memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. This security bulletin addresses the privately disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### FAQ for Excel Record Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3006

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

The scope of the vulnerability is determined by the attack scenario.

An attack against a user's local Excel client can result in remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

An attack against a Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 site can result in elevation of privilege. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain an elevation of privilege within SharePoint server, as opposed to elevation of privilege within the workstation or server environment.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Excel does not perform sufficient validation when parsing record values when loading Excel files into memory.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In an attack against a user's local Excel client, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

In an attack against a SharePoint site, an attacker would need an account in the SharePoint site with sufficient rights to upload a specially crafted Excel file and create a web part using the file on the SharePoint Site. As the SharePoint site creates the web part based on specially crafted records within the Excel file, the vulnerability could allow the attacker to run code with elevated privileges within the SharePoint server.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In an attack against a user's local Excel client, there are several scenarios such as a local attack, an email attack, or a Web-based attack, that an attacker could use to exploit the vulnerability.

In the local attack scenario, the vulnerability requires that a user open a malformed Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a malformed Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

In an attack against a SharePoint site, an attacker would need an account in the SharePoint site with sufficient rights to upload a specially crafted Excel file and create a web part using the file on the SharePoint Site. As the SharePoint site creates the web part based on specially crafted records within the Excel file, the vulnerability could allow the attacker to run code with elevated privileges within the SharePoint server.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

For local Excel client, systems where Microsoft Excel is used are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

For SharePoint sites, systems that are running SharePoint Server 2007, are primarily at risk.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the Ã¢ÂÂMicrosoft baseline Security AnalyzerÃ¢ÂÂ heading under the section, Microsoft Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Office Features

The following table contains the list of feature names (case sensitive) that must be reinstalled for the update.

To install all features, you can use **REINSTALL=ALL** or you can install the following features:

| Product | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| Excel 2007 | EXCELFiles |
| Excel Converter | ExcelConverter12Files |

**Note** Administrators working in managed environments can find complete resources for deploying Office updates in an organization at the Office Admin Update Center. At that site, scroll down and look under the **Update Resources** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides more information about the parameters supported by Windows Installer.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.

This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.

To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:

* [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?** orÂ **/help** | Displays usage dialog. |
| **/passive** | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel. |
| **/quiet** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/norestart** | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart. |
| **/forcerestart** | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |
| **/extract** | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/extract:<path>** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |
| **/lang:<LCID>** | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language. |
| **/log:<log file>** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Note** For more information about deploying updates on both stand-alone and multi server configurations, see [Deploy software updates for Office SharePoint Server 2007.](https://technet.microsoft.com/office/library/f484f5f2-35bb-4d70-bf56-dd1c4c287c72)
