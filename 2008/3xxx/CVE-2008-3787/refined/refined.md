{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'name' parameter when constructing SQL queries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data extraction, modification, or deletion. In this specific case, the exploit retrieves usernames and passwords from the 'members' table.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to `listing_view.php` with a malicious 'name' parameter."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and be aware of the vulnerability.",
    "additional_information": "The application is identified as 'Web Directory Script <= 2.0'. The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the database. The `magic_quotes_gpc` setting is noted to be 'Off', which means that there is no automatic escaping of special characters, making exploitation easier."
