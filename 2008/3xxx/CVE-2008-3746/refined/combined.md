1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- powerdns spoofing problems
The PowerDNS packages were updated to offer better spoofing
resistance by not ignoring invalid queries. (CVE-2008-3337)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- dnsmasq spoofing problems
The DNS server dnsmasq was changed to use random UDP source ports
and a random TRXID now. (CVE-2008-1447)
This problem only affected openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- python multiple problems
The scripting language python was updated to fix several security
vulnerabilities. (CVE-2008-1679,CVE-2008-1887, CVE-2008-3143,
CVE-2008-3142, CVE-2008-3144, CVE-2008-2315, CVE-2008-2316)
All SUSE Linux products received updated python packages.
- mailman cross site scripting
The mailing list manager mailman was updated to fix a
cross-site-scripting bug (CVE-2008-0564) and a mistake in
translation.
All distributions containing mailman received updated packages.
- ruby multiple problems
The scripting language ruby was updated to fix:
- a possible information leakage (CVE-2008-1145)
- a directory traversal bug (CVE-2008-1891) in WEBrick
- various memory corruptions and integer overflows in array and
string handling (CVE-2008-2662, CVE-2008-2663, CVE-2008-2664,
CVE-2008-2725, CVE-2008-2726, CVE-2008-2727, CVE-2008-2728)
ruby was updated on all SUSE Linux products.
- Opera 9.52
Opera was upgraded to version 9.52 to fix possible security
vulnerabilities.
Please see <http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/952/> for
more details.
- neon NULL pointer problem
The helper library neon was updated to fix a NULL pointer dereference
in the digest authentication code. (CVE-2008-3746)
neon was updated on all affected distributions.
- rxvt-unicode session hijacking
Using rxvt-unicode it was possible to open a terminal on :0 when
the environment variable was not set.
This could be exploited by local users to hijack X11 connections (CVE-2008-1142).
rxvt-unicode was updated on openSUSE 10.2-11.0.
- perl multiple problems
Several problems were fixed in the scripting language perl.
Specially crafted regular expressions could crash perl
(CVE-2008-1927).
Insufficient symlink checks in the File::Path could result in wrong
file permissions (CVE-2008-2827).
Additionally problem in the CGI module was fixed that could result
in an endless loop if uploads were canceled.
- Wireshark / ethereal multiple security problems
Various vulnerabilities have been fixed in ethereal and wireshark:
CVE-2008-3137, CVE-2008-3138, CVE-2008-3139,
CVE-2008-3140, CVE-2008-3141, CVE-2008-3145
and CVE-2008-3146. Those could be potentially used to crash
wireshark or potentially execute code.
Updates have been released for all SUSE Linux distributions.
- namazu cross site scripting
The indexing engine namazu was upgraded to fix a UTF-7
cross-site-scripting vulnerability. (CVE-2008-1468)
namazu was updated on all products containing it.
- gnome-screensaver clipboard disclosure
gnome-screensaver was updated to disallows local users to
read the contents of the clipboard for a locked screen using
ctrl-v. (CVE-2007-6389)
Updates have been released for openSUSE 10.3, other distributions
were not affected.
- MySQL security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix a security problem:
CVE-2008-2079: MySQL allowed local users to bypass certain privilege
checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1)
DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within
the MySQL home data directory, which can point to tables that are
created in the future.
CVE-2006-7232: sql\_select.cc in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.32 and 5.1.x
before 5.1.14 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA
table, as originally demonstrated using ORDER BY.
MySQL was updated on all SUSE Linux distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

I haven't had any luck contacting either the Debian maintainer or the
Debian BTS to update details of this issue.

----- Forwarded message from Joe Orton <joe@...yfish.co.uk> -----

Hi, can you assign a CVE number for an issue in neon:

A NULL pointer deference in the Digest authentication support in neon
versions 0.28.0 through 0.28.2 inclusive allows a malicious server to
crash a client application, resulting in possible denial of service.

Reference: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=476571>

Subject: libneon27: segmentation fault with dav/https shares
Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2008 19:09:37 +0200
```
Package: libneon27
Version: 0.28.2-1
Severity: normal

Hi,

I have a weird problem using svn with https dav repository, since 0.28 (it
worked and still works fine using 0.27).

The problem occurrs only on a private intranet and I couldnt reproduce it
outside yet, so I'm not able to give a backtrace, yet, sorry (I'll try to drop
all possible private info from the backtrace and post them later).

Basically, the segfault is in src/ne_uri.c, in merge_paths() function.
It tries to test base->path[0], but in my case, it's NULL, so the comparison
leads to a segfault.

When I follow the stack trace, it gives:
ne_uri.c:merge_paths()
ne_uri.c:ne_uri_resolve()
ne_auth.c:parse_domain()

It's in parse_domain() where base is initialized. There's a memset to 0, and
following the execution flow, I cant see where base->path could be initialized
and some memory allocated. Just after that, there is:

base.path = absolute.path;

So I guess testing (and setting) the base.path in merge_paths() is useless
anyway, but moving the instruction before the call to ne_uri_resolve() doesn't
solve the problem. The call to ne_uri_resolve is part of a loop, and the
second turn is with a base->path set to NULL again.

I know this bug report isn't really detailed enough, but the fact path is
never allocated seems wrong to me (and this part of the code has changed a lot
since 0.27). Maybe upstream could have some pointer on this?

(oh and btw, I've wrote this BR on an etch machine, but I'm testing on an
up-to-date sid box).

Thanks for your time, and regards,

Ho, and by the way, the same thing happens trying to mount the https
share with mount.davfs (wich uses libneon).

Hi,

I've managed to track down the issue. It seems there's a quad-nested-if
where not all conditions are correctly tested. In our case, it seems we
run into a “default condition” (don't know why it happens only in our
intranet). The attached patch fixes the problem for us and doesn't seem
to break neon when I test it on internet.

It'd be nice if the patch could be applied soon (after testing), because
currently subversion is completely unusable for us.

Thanks for your time, and regards.

Hi Joe,

I'm the maintainer of Neon packages in Debian. I got several bugreports
for 0.28.x [1][2].
For the former, there's a patch by Yves-Alexis Perez
<corsac-at-debian.org> which fix segfault if base->path is NULL :
--- a/src/ne_uri.c
+++ b/src/ne_uri.c
@@ -409,7 +409,7 @@ ne_uri *ne_uri_resolve(const ne_uri *base, const ne_uri *relative,
             } else {
                 if (relative->path[0] == '/') {
                     target->path = remove_dot_segments(relative->path);
-                } else {
+                } else if (base->path) {
                     char *merged = merge_paths(base, relative->path);
                     target->path = remove_dot_segments(merged);
                     ne_free(merged);

The latter is broken by me, right? I have specified:
--with-ca-bundle=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
in response to DAV asking for connection confirmation even if server
certificate signed by a trusted CA[3]. What can be the solution then?

Regards,

I've managed to reproduce this on the “outside world”. You can test
using:

<https://svn.grabeuh.com/svn/training>

then add something in trunk/ and try to commit. It segfaults in
ne_uri_resolve().

I've not rebuilt a not-optimized package so the backtrace is not yet
usable, but as you may reproduce it yourself, it may be not useful.

Please ask if you need it anyway.

Cheers,

Is there any news on this issue. As it's now possible to reproduce it
outside, it'd be nice to have a correction in the archive, and the
simple patch given works for us since a week, without brokenness.

Did you have answer from upstream about this?

Cheers, and thanks for the work,

I am experimenting a segfault on a WebDAV connection through HTTPS with

I experiment the problem on all plate-form I tried out (mainly x86 and

My guess is that saved eip is over-written when accessed but I have no
clue why. :-(

If you find out why or if you want to try out some things on my trace (I
easily admit that the bug isn't easy to reproduce out of the context of
sitecopy and the content of my website), feel free to ask !

By the way, I did this on amd64 but I can easily do it on x86 (I guess
it will be the same more or less).

Hi,

It seems that the problem is located exactly at ne_session.c:217, it is
to say:

static void progress_notifier(void *userdata, ne_session_status status,
                              const ne_session_status_info *info)
{
 ne_session *sess = userdata;

 if (status == ne_status_sending || status == ne_status_recving) {
  sess->progress_cb(sess->progress_ud,info->sr.progress,info->sr.total);
 }
}

When executing step by step and stopping just before the segfault,
printing the variable 'sess' seems to be impossible there although the
scope seems to allow it.

(gdb)
progress_notifier (userdata=0x8070ad8, status=ne_status_sending,
    info=0x8070ba0)
    at /neon27-0.28.2/src/ne_session.c:216
216	    if (status == ne_status_sending || status == ne_status_recving) {
(gdb)
217	        sess->progress_cb(sess->progress_ud, info->sr.progress,
info->sr.total);
(gdb) p sess
No symbol "sess" in current context.

Anyway, userdata can be used in place of sess:

(gdb) p userdata
$17 = (void *) 0x8070ad8
(gdb) disas 0x8070ad8
No function contains specified address.
(gdb) ptype userdata
type = void *
(gdb) p (ne_session*) userdata
$18 = (struct ne_session_s *) 0x8070ad8
(gdb) p ((ne_session*) userdata)->progress_cb
$19 = (ne_progress) 0x804b530 <site_sock_progress_cb>
(gdb) p ((ne_session*) userdata)->progress_ud
$20 = (void *) 0x0
(gdb) p ((ne_session*) userdata)
$21 = (struct ne_session_s *) 0x8070ad8

The progress function seems to be site_sock_progress_cb and the
progress_ud seems to be 0x0 (I don't know if it is meaningfull or not).

I checked also info and everything seemed ok.

I'll try to get further later. :)

Hi again,

Ok, I have a bit more understanding of what is going on there now.

It seems that the progress function which seems to be given through a
function pointer (progress_cb) is not always set properly.

Here is a run with a break at:

217	        sess->progress_cb(sess->progress_ud, info->sr.progress,

You can see that the parameters are evolving quite ok at the beginning
and then suddenly the userdata->progress_cb get lost for some reason
that I failed to find until now:

10: info->sr.total = 16280
9: info->sr.progress = 8192
8: ((struct ne_session_s *) userdata)->progress_cb = (
    ne_progress) 0x804b530 <site_sock_progress_cb>
7: ((struct ne_session_s *) userdata)->progress_ud = (void *) 0x0
6: (struct ne_session_s *) userdata = (struct ne_session_s *) 0x8070ad8
(gdb)
Continuing.
.

Back again,

Soooo, I think I was wrong... in fact the problem seems to come from
sitecopy which misuse the libneon API (at least this is my guess).

Here is what happen:

The libneon:ne_session.c:progress_notifier can be called even though
sitecopy:davdriver.c:file_read has freed the userdata field (called
eremote in the scope of sitecopy) at davdriver.c:519.

(not) Surprisingly, libneon crash when the progress_notifier is called
upon NULL userdata.

Anyway, in my humble opinion, I think the problem should be solved in
libneon as this library seems not programmed in an enough defensive way.
E.g., in the function:

static void progress_notifier(void *userdata, ne_session_status status,
                              const ne_session_status_info *info)
{
 ne_session *sess = userdata;

 if (status == ne_status_sending || status == ne_status_recving) {
  sess->progress_cb(sess->progress_ud,info->sr.progress,info->sr.total);
 }
}

One should also check that userdata is not NULL... as the userdata seems
to still be in the user's memory scope.

« Abandon every hope, ye who trust user's data here. »

:)
