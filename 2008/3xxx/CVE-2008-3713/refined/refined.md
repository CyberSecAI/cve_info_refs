Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an SQL injection in the `pro_id` parameter of the `product.php` script of PHPBasket application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`pro_id`), allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords as shown in the provided PoCs.
- Potential for Further Attacks: Successful SQL injection can lead to other vulnerabilities, such as complete database compromise, or even gaining shell access to the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted GET requests to the `product.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No special privileges are required, making this a remote, unauthenticated vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) demonstrate the injection using `union all select` to retrieve user credentials by exploiting the vulnerable `pro_id` parameter within `product.php`
- The attacker uses the `concat()` function to combine the username and password to extract them in a single column.
- The attacker also uses `char(58)` which is an ASCII code for colon, to put a separator between username and password in the extracted data.
