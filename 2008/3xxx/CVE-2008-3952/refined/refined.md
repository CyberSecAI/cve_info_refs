Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3952 (although the exploit also references CVE-2008-6016, indicating possible confusion or multiple related issues)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `questions.php` script of the EsFaq application. Specifically, the `idcat` parameter in the URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `idcat` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data. In this case, the provided exploit targets `login` and `password` from the `admin_users` table.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to further compromise of the application and the server it resides on.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `questions.php` script, specifically by manipulating the `idcat` parameter in the URL.
    - Example: `www.[target].com/Script/questions.php?idcat=10 UNION SELECT 1,concat(login,0x3a,password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9 FROM admin_users--`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:**  The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to construct a malicious SQL query.
- **Understanding of the Application:** Basic understanding of the application's parameters or structure of the database helps to create the malicious SQL query.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit code targets the `admin_users` table and specifically extracts the `login` and `password` columns.
- The provided exploit also includes a "dork," suggesting that vulnerable instances of EsFaq can be found using a Google search with `inurl:questions.php?idcat`.
