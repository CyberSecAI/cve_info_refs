If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could also execute code with Windows Media Services distribution credentials, gaining NETWORK SERVICE account privileges.",

          "The vulnerability requires that a user with an affected version of Windows Media components access a malicious server.",
           "An attacker could host a malicious server share or Web site that requires authentication. When the client connects and authenticates to the malicious server, the attacker can use the credentials provided by the client to reflect back to the client, or forward the credentials on to other servers, thereby mimicking the client."

        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to host a malicious server and convince the user to access it. Social engineering could be used to get users to click on a link leading to the malicious server."
