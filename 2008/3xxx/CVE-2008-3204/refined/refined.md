Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-3204

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `id_cat` parameter of the `tops_top.php` script within the "Million Pixels 3" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `id_cat` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Exposure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to access and potentially modify sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords from the `tbl_admins` table. This can lead to full compromise of the application and potentially the server.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** In some cases, SQL injection can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution. Though not explicitly stated in the provided information, it's a risk to be aware of.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `tops_top.php` page, injecting malicious SQL code into the `id_cat` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application, indicating that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable via the internet or any network the vulnerable application is accessible from.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax in order to craft the injection payload.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit demonstrates how to extract usernames and passwords by injecting the following SQL query:
```
-5/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/1,concat_ws(0x3a,UserName,Password)/**/from/**/tbl_admins/*
```
This SQL injection uses `UNION SELECT` to append the result of a malicious `SELECT` query to the original query's result. The injected query concatenates usernames and passwords separated by a colon (0x3a) from the `tbl_admins` table, which is returned as part of the web page response.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit uses `/**/` which is used as an alternative to a space and bypass some basic web application firewalls.
- The provided exploit targets the `tbl_admins` table, which most likely stores administrative user credentials.
- The `DorK` or Google Dork is: `inurl: "tops_top.php? id_cat ="` which can be used to find vulnerable instances of the application on the internet.
