## Security fix released

Posted by **James Bennett** on Sept. 2, 2008

In accordance with [our security policy](http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/contributing/#reporting-security-issues), today the Django project is
issuing a set of releases to fix a security vulnerability reported to
us. This message contains a description of the vulnerability, a
description of the changes made to fix it, and pointers to the patches
for each supported version of Django.

#### Description of vulnerability

The Django administration application, as a convenience for users
whose sessions expire, will attempt to preserve HTTP POST data from an
incoming submission while re-authenticating the user, and will -- on
successful authentication -- allow the submission to continue without
requiring data to be re-entered.

Django developer Simon Willison has presented the Django development
team with a proof-of-concept cross-site request forgery (CSRF) which
exploits this behavior to perform unrequested deletion/modification of
data. This exploit has been tested and verified by the Django team,
and succeeds regardless of whether Django's bundled CSRF-protection
module is active.

#### Affected versions

* Django development trunk
* Django 0.96
* Django 0.95
* Django 0.91

#### Resolution

As it represents a persistent vector for CSRF attacks, this behavior
is being removed from Django; henceforth, attempted posts from users
whose sessions have expired will be discarded and the data will need
to be re-entered.

This is, then, backwards-incompatible with existing behavior and may
be considered a feature removal; however, the Django team feel that
the security risks of this feature outweigh its minor utility.

The fix for this issue was applied to the Django repository in
[changeset 8877](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/8877), which contains the relevant changes for each affected
version

Based on these changes, the Django team is issuing three new releases:

* Django 0.96.3: <http://www.djangoproject.com/download/0.96.3/tarball/>
* Django 0.95.4: <http://www.djangoproject.com/download/0.95.4/tarball/>
* Django 0.91.3: <http://www.djangoproject.com/download/0.91.3/tarball/>

The relevant patch has been applied to Django trunk as well, and so
will be included in the forthcoming Django 1.0 release candidate (to
be issued later today) and the final Django 1.0 release.

All users of affected Django versions are encouraged to upgrade
immediately.

A file containing the MD5 and SHA1 checksums of the new release
packages has been [placed on the djangoproject.com server](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/django-security-releases-20080901.checksums.txt).
This file is PGP-signed with the Django release manager's public
key. This key has the ID 0x8C8B2AE1 and can be obtained
from, e.g., [the MIT PGP keyserver](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x8C8B2AE1)

#### Release manager's note

If you are currently maintaining and distributing a packaged version
of Django (e.g., for a Linux or other Unix distribution), or if you
are a hosting company which officially supports Django as an option
for customers, and you did **not** receive an advance notification of
this issue, please contact Django's release manager (James Bennett,
james at b-list dot org) as soon as possible so that you can be added
to the list of known distributors who receive such notifications.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1640-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                          Thijs Kinkhorst
September 20, 2008                    <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : python-django
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-3909 CVE-2007-5712
Debian Bug     : 497765 448838

Simon Willison discovered that in Django, a Python web framework, the
feature to retain HTTP POST data during user reauthentication allowed
a remote attacker to perform unauthorized modification of data through
cross site request forgery. The is possible regardless of the Django
plugin to prevent cross site request forgery being enabled. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this issue as
CVE-2008-3909.

In this update the affected feature is disabled; this is in accordance
with upstream's preferred solution for this situation.

This update takes the opportunity to also include a relatively minor
denial of service attack in the internationalisaton framework, known
as CVE-2007-5712.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.95.1-1etch2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=460966#c0)  Steve Milner    2008-09-03 00:57:03 UTC  ``` Description of problem: The following was reported today to the public (Sept, 2, 2008) via the Django main site:  The Django administration application, as a convenience for users whose sessions expire, will attempt to preserve HTTP POST data from an incoming submission while re-authenticating the user, and will -- on successful authentication -- allow the submission to continue without requiring data to be re-entered.  Django developer Simon Willison has presented the Django development team with a proof-of-concept cross-site request forgery (CSRF) which exploits this behavior to perform unrequested deletion/modification of data. This exploit has been tested and verified by the Django team, and succeeds regardless of whether Django's bundled CSRF-protection module is active.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  Django-0.96.2-1  Extra Info Since I am not aware if the maintainer of the package was given advance notice I'm cc'ing him on this bug.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=460966#c1)  James Bennett    2008-09-03 01:14:21 UTC  ``` Michel was listed on the advance notification last week, albeit at a different address; if the address CC'd above is the correct address to use for such notifications, let me know and I'll update our list.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=460966#c2)  Michel Lind    2008-09-03 01:43:11 UTC  ``` What e-mail address was used for the advance notification? I just checked and could not find the e-mail.  Please use salimma or michel.sylvan -- preferably the former. Thanks.  Working on the new release now.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=460966#c3)  James Bennett    2008-09-03 01:59:22 UTC  ``` I had previously received email from michel.salim@gmail and was using that; it never bounced so I'd assumed it was still the correct one; I'll switch to the fedora address for the future.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=460966#c4)  Fedora Update System    2008-09-03 02:26:54 UTC  ``` Django-0.96.3-1.fc9 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 9. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/Django-0.96.3-1.fc9>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=460966#c5)  Fedora Update System    2008-09-03 02:28:45 UTC  ``` Django-0.96.3-1.fc9 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 9. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/Django-0.96.3-1.fc9>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=460966#c6)  Fedora Update System    2008-09-03 02:29:32 UTC  ``` Django-0.96.3-1.fc8 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 8. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/Django-0.96.3-1.fc8>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=460966#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-04 18:11:58 UTC  ``` CVE id [CVE-2008-3909](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-3909) was assigned to this issue:  The administration application in Django 0.91, 0.95, and 0.96 stores unauthenticated HTTP POST requests and processes them after successful authentication occurs, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and delete or modify data via unspecified requests.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=460966#c8)  Michel Lind    2008-09-06 14:38:40 UTC  ``` Update has been marked stable, but for some reason the bug is not automatically closed; closing now.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=460966#c9)  Fedora Update System    2008-09-10 06:35:46 UTC  ``` Django-0.96.3-1.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=460966#c10)  Fedora Update System    2008-09-10 06:40:49 UTC  ``` Django-0.96.3-1.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
