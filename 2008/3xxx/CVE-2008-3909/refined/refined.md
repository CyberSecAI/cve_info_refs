{
  "CVE-2008-3909": {
    "Description": "The Django administration application, as a convenience for users whose sessions expire, will attempt to preserve HTTP POST data from an incoming submission while re-authenticating the user, and will -- on successful authentication -- allow the submission to continue without requiring data to be re-entered.",
    "Root cause": "The Django administration application preserves HTTP POST data during user re-authentication.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
      "Preservation of HTTP POST data after session expiration during re-authentication"
    ],
    "Impact": "Allows a remote attacker to perform unauthorized modification or deletion of data.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious request that targets a Django application where a user's session has expired, and the POST data is then replayed upon successful login."
