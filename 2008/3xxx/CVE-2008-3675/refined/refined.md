**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `imgsize.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not require any authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely, simply by sending a malicious HTTP request.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable URL is `http://localhost/[Script]/classes/imgsize.php?img=[file]`.
