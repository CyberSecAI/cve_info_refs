- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to insecure handling of the `CFG[txtsql][class]` parameter in `startup.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The application allows the attacker to include remote files via the `CFG[txtsql][class]` parameter. The text implies register globals is on in the PHP configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain system access by including and executing arbitrary remote code on the vulnerable server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `CFG[txtsql][class]` parameter of the `startup.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a remote file with malicious code. The attacker does not need to be on the local network.
