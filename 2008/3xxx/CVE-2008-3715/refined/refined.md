Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `inc-core-admin-editor-previouscolorsjs.php` file of FlexCMS version 2.5 or earlier.
- The `PreviousColorsString` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in the `document.write()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS.
- The script directly outputs user-supplied data into the HTML without sanitization.
- The code uses `print 'document.write(\''.$PreviousColorsString.'\');';` which is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser.
- This can lead to:
  - Hijacking of administrator cookies.
  - Stealing user sessions.
  - Performing malicious actions on behalf of the user.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL, specifically manipulating the `PreviousColorsString` GET parameter.
- The victim needs to visit the crafted URL for the XSS to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with arbitrary query string values.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker only needs the victim to open the malicious URL in their browser.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable File:** `inc-core-admin-editor-previouscolorsjs.php`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `PreviousColorsString`
- **Vulnerable Code:** `print 'document.write(\''.$PreviousColorsString.'\');';`
- **Example URL:** `http://example/inc-core-admin-editor-previouscolorsjs.php?PreviousColorsString=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`

**Mitigation:**
- The suggested solution is to filter the `PreviousColorsString` variable using the `htmlspecialchars()` function before outputting it. This will prevent the execution of injected scripts.

This vulnerability is a classic example of a reflected XSS vulnerability where user-supplied data is displayed back to the user without proper sanitization.
