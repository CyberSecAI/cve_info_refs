Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3706:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `bannerclick.php` script in Zeeways ZeeJobsite 2.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `adid` parameter. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `adid` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The application directly includes user input into the SQL query string without using parameterized queries or prepared statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Exposure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords, customer data).
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The provided exploit targets the `admin` table to extract user credentials, potentially leading to administrator access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attacker sends a malicious SQL query through the `adid` parameter in the HTTP GET request to the `bannerclick.php` script.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable without requiring any specific user interaction beyond sending a crafted HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No special privileges or access to the server are required.
*   The attacker needs to know the path and the vulnerable script (`bannerclick.php`) and the parameter (`adid`).

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit demonstrates how an attacker can use the SQL `UNION` operator to concatenate sensitive information (username and password from the admin table) into a single field. The attack string is:

`www.[target].com/Script/bannerclick.php?adid=-5+union+select+1,2,concat(name,0x3e,pwd),4,5,6,7,8,9+from+admin--`

*   `-5`:  Used to ensure that no legitimate data is returned, so only the attacker's injected data is displayed.
*   `union select`:  Used to combine the results of the attacker's query with the original query.
*   `1,2,concat(name,0x3e,pwd),4,5,6,7,8,9`: The columns returned by the `select` statement; `concat(name,0x3e,pwd)` is used to get the name and password (with '>' in between) of the admin user.
*   `from admin`: Targets the admin table.
*   `--`: Used to comment out any remaining part of the original SQL query.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit details include a live demo link which likely demonstrates the vulnerability. However, that link may be outdated.
*   The exploit targets `zeejobsite.com`, indicating a real-world target.
*   The exploit includes a path to the admin login page, `www.[target].com/Script/admin/`, which an attacker may target after obtaining credentials.
