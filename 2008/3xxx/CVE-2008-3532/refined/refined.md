{
  "CVE-2008-3532": {
    "Description": "The NSS plugin in libpurple in Pidgin 2.4.3 does not verify SSL certificates, which makes it easier for remote attackers to trick a user into accepting an invalid server certificate for a spoofed service.",
    "Root cause": "The NSS plugin in libpurple does not perform proper SSL certificate verification.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of SSL certificate verification."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by presenting a spoofed SSL certificate, potentially leading to exposure of sensitive information. The user might unknowingly connect to a malicious service.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack",
      "Network traffic interception"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to intercept network traffic between the client and the server",
      "Ability to present a forged SSL certificate"
    ],
     "More Information": "The vulnerability was introduced when the SSL implementation was changed from GNUTLS to NSS. The fix involved adding SSL certificate checking to the NSS plugin and correcting the path for CA certificates."
