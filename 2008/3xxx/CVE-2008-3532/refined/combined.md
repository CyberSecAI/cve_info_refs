# CVE-2008-3532

| **Name** | CVE-2008-3532 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The NSS plugin in libpurple in Pidgin 2.4.3 does not verify SSL certificates, which makes it easier for remote attackers to trick a user into accepting an invalid server certificate for a spoofed service. |

```
Package: pidgin
Version: 2.4.3-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

I recently set up a Jabber server.  I used the default snakeoil
certificate.  When I configured Pidgin to connect to my new server,
using SSL, it connected without any complaint whatsoever.

```
```
I believe this bug was introduced with the "fix" for bug #401567.

At that time, the SSL implementation was changed from GNUTLS to NSS.
Unfortunately, the NSS plugin in pidgin does no certificate checking at
all, meaning that any certificate is accepted (including malformed or
self-signed ones).

I recommend switching back to gnutls.  Patch attached.  The attached
patch also corrects a problem in reading the certificate store from
/etc/ssl/certs .  (note that this patch is cumulative to
00_debian-ca-certs.patch .)

Unfortunately, it is now the case that any passwords transmitted over an
NSS created link could have been compromised by man-in-the-middle
attacks, since many people use the PLAIN auth mechanism.  Any valuable
passwords compromised in this way should be changed.

If what you say is correct, then most Pidgin installations are not
verifying certificates correctly and this isn't just a Debian problem.
Any patch needs to address the real issue, especially since upstream has
discouraged using GNUTLS.

```
As requested, NSS patch submitted to Pidgin in forwarded bug report, so
there's no need to switch to GNUTLS.

However, the second half of the patch above is still needed to grab CA
certs from /etc/ssl/certs.  Attaching just that part.

Why is a patch necessary to enable /etc/ssl/certs?  Does
--with-system-ssl-certs= not do what you need?  If so, we should fix
it, rather than applying additional hacks.

As far as I can tell, --with-system-ssl-certs doesn't exist in 2.4.3.

Ari Pollak spake unto us the following wisdom:
> As far as I can tell, --with-system-ssl-certs doesn't exist in 2.4.3.

Whoops, an excellent point.  You might want to simply use the attached
(untested, but compiles and looks rather trivial) patch, instead,
which is from upstream.  It is upstream revision
90ed1fb17982cbb6355d5dd32d041b8c0027509b and
19703c67fa680f4ee37fb1ff944b7b3a0fcf18a4.

This option will be in 2.5.0 when it releases.  Sorry for the
confusion.  :-)  If *this* doesn't do what you need, let us know ASAP
and we'll make sure what you need is in 2.5.0.

Unfortunately this means I'd have to re-run autoconf & automake during
build, which I'm trying to avoid doing. Since the current patch
essentially does the same thing in the end, I'll just switch to the
configure option for 2.5.0 and fix the path for now.

pidgin security and bug fix update (RHSA-2008-1023)

Original Release Date: December 16, 2008

Last Revised: December 16, 2008

Number: ASA-2008-493

Risk Level: None

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Pidgin is a multi-protocol Internet Messaging client.

A denial-of-service flaw was found in Pidgin's MSN protocol handler. If a
remote user was able to send, and the Pidgin user accepted, a
carefully-crafted file request, it could result in Pidgin crashing.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-2955](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2955) to this issue.

A denial-of-service flaw was found in Pidgin's Universal Plug and Play
(UPnP) request handling. A malicious UPnP server could send a request to
Pidgin, causing it to download an excessive amount of data, consuming all
available memory or disk space.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-2957](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2957) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Pidgin handled SSL certificates. The NSS SSL
implementation in Pidgin did not properly verify the authenticity of SSL
certificates. This could have resulted in users unknowingly connecting to a
malicious SSL service.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-3532](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3532) to this issue.

In addition, this update upgrades pidgin from version 2.3.1 to version
2.5.2, with many additional stability and functionality fixes from the
Pidgin Project.

Note: the Secure Internet Live Conferencing (SILC) chat network protocol
has recently changed, affecting all versions of pidgin shipped with Red Hat
Enterprise Linux.

Pidgin cannot currently connect to the latest version of the SILC server
(1.1.14): it fails to properly exchange keys during initial login. This
update does not correct this. Red Hat Bugzilla #474212 (linked to in the
References section) has more information.

Note: after the errata packages are installed, Pidgin must be restarted for
the update to take effect.

No Avaya system products are vulnerable, as pidgin is not installed by default.

More information about this vulnerability can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-1023.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with pidgin installed: None

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-675-1: Pidgin vulnerabilities

24 November 2008

Pidgin vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)

## Packages

* [pidgin](/security/cves?package=pidgin) -

## Details

It was discovered that Pidgin did not properly handle certain malformed

messages in the MSN protocol handler. A remote attacker could send a specially

crafted message and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

([CVE-2008-2927](/security/CVE-2008-2927))

It was discovered that Pidgin did not properly handle file transfers containing

a long filename and special characters in the MSN protocol handler. A remote

attacker could send a specially crafted filename in a file transfer request

and cause Pidgin to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-2955](/security/CVE-2008-2955))

It was discovered that Pidgin did not impose resource limitations in the UPnP

service. A remote attacker could cause Pidgin to download arbitrary files

and cause a denial of service from memory or disk space exhaustion.

([CVE-2008-2957](/security/CVE-2008-2957))

It was discovered that Pidgin did not validate SSL certificates when using a

secure connection. If a remote attacker were able to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive

information. This update alters Pidgin behaviour by asking users to confirm

the validity of a certificate upon initial login. ([CVE-2008-3532](/security/CVE-2008-3532))

### Reduce your security exposure

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [pidgin](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin)
  -
  [1:2.4.1-1ubuntu2.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin/1%3A2.4.1-1ubuntu2.2)

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [pidgin](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin)
  -
  [1:2.2.1-1ubuntu4.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin/1%3A2.2.1-1ubuntu4.3)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Pidgin to effect

the necessary changes.
