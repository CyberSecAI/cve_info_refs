## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0698)

## Topic

Updated rhevm-spice-client packages that fix multiple security issues,
several bugs, and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager provides access to virtual
machines using SPICE. These SPICE client packages provide the SPICE client
and usbclerk service for both Windows 32-bit operating systems and Windows
64-bit operating systems.

This update adds support for the TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value
(TLS\_FALLBACK\_SCSV), which can be used to prevent protocol downgrade
attacks against applications which re-connect using a lower SSL/TLS
protocol version when the initial connection indicating the highest
supported protocol version fails.

This can prevent a forceful downgrade of the communication to SSL 3.0.
The SSL 3.0 protocol was found to be vulnerable to the padding oracle
attack when using block cipher suites in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
This issue is identified as CVE-2014-3566, and also known under the alias
POODLE. This SSL 3.0 protocol flaw will not be addressed in a future
update; it is recommended that users configure their applications to
require at least TLS protocol version 1.0 for secure communication.

For additional information about this flaw, see the Knowledgebase article
at <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123>

Multiple flaws were found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 image files.
A specially crafted file could cause an application using JasPer to crash
or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8138, CVE-2014-8157,
CVE-2014-8158, CVE-2014-9029, CVE-2014-8137, CVE-2011-4516, CVE-2011-4517,
CVE-2008-3520, CVE-2008-3522)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2014-8137,
CVE-2014-8138, CVE-2014-8157, CVE-2014-8158, CVE-2014-9029, CVE-2011-4516,
and CVE-2011-4517. oCERT acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security
Team as the original reporter of CVE-2014-8137 and CVE-2014-8138; and
pyddeh as the original reporter of CVE-2014-8157 and CVE-2014-8158.

The mingw-openssl and mingw-jasper packages have been upgraded to the
latest upstream version, which provides a number of bug fixes and
enhancements over the previous version. (BZ#1187585)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, a guest system installed with tools incorrectly always

started in full screen mode, even when the "Open in Full Screen" option was
unchecked in console options. Now, when connecting in window mode with the
option unchecked, the guest system starts in a window as expected.
(BZ#1172126)

* Prior to this update, copying and pasting of images from the client to

the guest did not work when spice-gtk was built from upstream. Now, images
can be copied and pasted without problems. (BZ#1187270)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

* Administrators now have the option of automatic multiuser installation of

virt-viewer onto many client workstations. (BZ#1187272)

All rhevm-spice-client users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancement.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

I am a bit irritated. >   sorry, the CC was just to inform you. For the moment, patches have been provided on vendor-sec, but some of them are *BSD specific (e.g they use strlcat()), so they'll need some additional work to make them apply on Linux. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-19 09:29:19 UTC  ``` The following analysis was provided by Ludwig Nussel of Suse/Novell:  CVE-2008-3520: - patches change all occurrences of malloc(a*b) with   jas_alloc2(a,b). Hard to tell whether any are actually   exploitable. Some seem to multiply a value from the file with the   size of a structure indeed. The ones that multiply two variables   seem to be harmless due to 16 or only 8 bit values. I talked to   Marc Espie but he is not interested in investigating it further.   So unless someone wants to spend a lot of time analyzing the   context of every multiplication patching all such places seems to   be a logical defensive measurement.  CVE-2008-3521: - tmp race in jas_stream_tmpfile(), jas_stream.c  CVE-2008-3522: - vsprintf buffer overflow in jas_stream_printf(), jas_stream.c. Potentially   dangerous. Called from mif_hdr_put() where it's not obvious to me   whether there is a limit on the passed string.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-19 09:30:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 163282](attachment.cgi?id=163282 "jasper-1.900.1-CVE-2008-3520+1+2.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=163282&action=edit "jasper-1.900.1-CVE-2008-3520+1+2.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=163282&action=diff "jasper-1.900.1-CVE-2008-3520+1+2.patch")] jasper-1.900.1-CVE-2008-3520+1+2.patch  Relevant portions of the patches shipped by OpenBSD ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-19 09:31:57 UTC  ``` Patrick, we are currently discussing whether the patch and information about the vulnerabilities should be embargoed and until when.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# JasPer: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200812-18**

Multiple memory management errors in JasPer might lead to execution of
arbitrary code via jpeg2k files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/jasper** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.900.1-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.900.1-r3** |

### Background

The JasPer Project is an open-source initiative to provide a free
software-based reference implementation of the codec specified in the
JPEG-2000 Part-1 (jpeg2k) standard.

### Description

Marc Espie and Christian Weisgerber have discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in JasPer:

* Multiple integer overflows might allow for insufficient memory
  allocation, leading to heap-based buffer overflows (CVE-2008-3520).
* The jas\_stream\_printf() function in libjasper/base/jas\_stream.c uses
  vsprintf() to write user-provided data to a static to a buffer, leading
  to an overflow (CVE-2008-3522).

### Impact

Remote attackers could entice a user or automated system to process
specially crafted jpeg2k files with an application using JasPer,
possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All JasPer users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/jasper-1.900.1-r3"
```

# USN-742-1: JasPer vulnerabilities

19 March 2009

JasPer vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [jasper](/security/cves?package=jasper) -

## Details

It was discovered that JasPer did not correctly handle memory allocation

when parsing certain malformed JPEG2000 images. If a user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted image with an application that uses libjasper,

an attacker could cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary

code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2008-3520](/security/CVE-2008-3520))

It was discovered that JasPer created temporary files in an insecure way.

Local users could exploit a race condition and cause a denial of service in

libjasper applications.

([CVE-2008-3521](/security/CVE-2008-3521))

It was discovered that JasPer did not correctly handle certain formatting

operations. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image

with an application that uses libjasper, an attacker could cause a denial

of service and possibly execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.

([CVE-2008-3522](/security/CVE-2008-3522))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=461478#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-08 13:30:10 UTC  ``` Marc Espie and Christian Weisgerber of the OpenBSD project reported that jas_stream_printf() function used by jasper uses vsprintf() internally to print data to a fixed-size buffer.  This can result in a buffer overflow in cases where jas_stream_printf() may be called with untrusted user-supplied data.  OpenBSD jasper library patches: <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/graphics/jasper/patches/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=461478#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-08 13:35:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 316079](attachment.cgi?id=316079&action=diff "OpenBSD patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=316079&action=edit "OpenBSD patch") OpenBSD patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=461478#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-08 13:53:20 UTC  ``` netpbm contains an embedded copy of the jasper library for use in jpeg2ktopam and pamtojpeg2k converters.  Even though it contains vulnerable version of jas_stream_printf(), that function is not used in netpbm.  Parts of the jasper sources that contain a call of jas_stream_printf() that can possibly result in an overflow, are not embedded in the netpbm source.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
