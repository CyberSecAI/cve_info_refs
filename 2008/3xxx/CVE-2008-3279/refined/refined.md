Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3279:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `brltty` packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 were built with an insecure relative RPATH (Run-Time Search Path) in the ELF header of the `/usr/lib/brltty/libbrlttybba.so` library. The RPATH was set to `../../Programs`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure RPATH configuration: Using a relative RPATH like `../../Programs` allows a malicious user to potentially inject malicious shared objects by manipulating the directory structure of the user executing the affected application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A local attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a victim user. This is achieved by convincing the victim user to run a command using the affected library in an attacker-controlled directory containing specially crafted content, which would be loaded due to the insecure RPATH.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- File system manipulation: The attacker needs to control a directory and create malicious content that will be loaded instead of the intended one based on the vulnerable RPATH.
- Social engineering: The attacker needs to convince a victim user to execute a command using the affected library while being located in the malicious folder.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user account on the system.
- Ability to create directories and files.
- Ability to influence a victim user to execute a program with a vulnerable library from attacker controlled directory

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability does not affect `brltty` versions 3.8 and 3.9, which are shipped with Fedora.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 through RHSA-2010:0181.
