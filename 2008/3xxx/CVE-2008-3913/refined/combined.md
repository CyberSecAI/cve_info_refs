How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# ClamAV: Multiple Denials of Service — GLSA **200809-18**

Multiple vulnerabilities in ClamAV may result in a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-antivirus/clamav** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.94** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.94** |

### Background

Clam AntiVirus is a free anti-virus toolkit for UNIX, designed
especially for e-mail scanning on mail gateways.

### Description

Hanno boeck reported an error in libclamav/chmunpack.c when processing
CHM files (CVE-2008-1389). Other unspecified vulnerabilities were also
reported, including a NULL pointer dereference in libclamav
(CVE-2008-3912), memory leaks in freshclam/manager.c (CVE-2008-3913),
and file descriptor leaks in libclamav/others.c and libclamav/sis.c
(CVE-2008-3914).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to scan a
specially crafted CHM, possibly resulting in a Denial of Service
(daemon crash). The other attack vectors mentioned above could also
result in a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.94"
```

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1660-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Florian Weimer
October 26, 2008                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : clamav
Vulnerability  : null pointer derefence, resource exhaustation
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-3912, CVE-2008-3913, CVE-2008-3914

Several denial-of-service vulnerabilities have been discovered in
the ClamAV anti-virus toolkit:

Insufficient checking for out-of-memory conditions results in null
pointer derefences (CVE-2008-3912).

Incorrect error handling logic leads to memory leaks (CVE-2008-3913)
and file descriptor leaks (CVE-2008-3914).

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.90.1dfsg-4etch15.

For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 0.94.dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Use CVE-2008-3912, to be filled in later.  I have mixed opinions on
out-of-memory null dereferences, though in security software it seems
reasonable to flag it.

>  * fix possible invalid memory access (bb#1089)

CVE-2008-1389 as mentioned by Hanno.

>  * fix error path memleaks and fd leaks (bb#1141)

Use CVE-2008-3913 for the memory leak.

Use CVE-2008-3914 for the fd leak.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- imlib2
Specially crafted xpm files could trigger a stack based buffer overflow
in imlib2 which could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2008-2426).
- mono
A bug in the ASP.net class library of mono allowed cross site
scripting attacks (CVE-2008-3422).
- tomcat5
Tomcat was updated to fix a cross site scripting issue and directory traversal
problems (CVE-2008-1232, CVE-2008-2370, CVE-2008-2938)
- libtiff
Specially crafted lzw files could trigger a buffer underflow in
libtiff (CVE-2008-2327).
- libxml2
Specially crafted xml files could cause a crash or a heap based
buffer overlow in libxml2 (CVE-2008-3281, CVE-2008-3529).
- clamav
Clamav has been updated to version 0.94. It fixes numerous problems
including some security relevant ones (CVE-2008-3912, CVE-2008-1389,
CVE-2008-3913, CVE-2008-3914).
This new version changed the library version number once again so
dependent packages had do be updated as well (clamav,
sylpheed-claws, claws-mail).
- emacs
When editing Python files Emacs accidently imported other Python
script in the current directory (CVE-2008-3949).
- php5
php5 has been updated to fix some overflows in the gd extension and
the memnstr() function that could crash php or even cause a buffer
overflow (CVE-2008-3658, CVE-2008-3659 and CVE-2008-3660)
- uvcvideo
The kernel driver uvcvideo was vulnerable to a buffer overflow in
format descriptor parsing code (CVE-2008-3496).
- postfix
When exectuting external programs postfix didn't close the file
descriptor of the epoll system call. This could potentially be
exploited to shutdown postfix (CVE-2008-3889).

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  Impact: Systems that have been manually configured to use rlogin and host.equiv may unexpectedly permit root login

  Description: The manpage for the configuration file hosts.equiv indicates that entries do not apply to root. However, an implementation issue in rlogind causes these entries to also apply to root. This update addresses the issue by properly disallowing rlogin from the root user if the remote system is in hosts.equiv. The rlogin service is not enabled by default in Mac OS X, and must be manually configured in order to be enabled. Credit to Ralf Meyer for reporting this issue.
