{
  "CVE-2008-3211": {
    "Description": "The Scripteen Free Image Hosting Script 1.2 is vulnerable to a password disclosure vulnerability. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to grab the admin password through a crafted HTTP request.",
    "Root cause": "The application discloses sensitive information (admin username and password) through the settings.php file when a specific cookie value is provided.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure",
      "Insecure cookie handling"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can obtain the admin username and password, which could lead to complete compromise of the application. This includes unauthorized access to user data, configuration settings, and the ability to modify the application's content and functionality.",
     "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the `admin/settings.php` script with a specific `Cookie: cookid=1` header.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server.",
       "No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability."
    ],
     "Additional Information": "The exploit leverages the lack of proper access control to `settings.php`, allowing retrieval of admin credentials via a cookie bypass. The `settings.php` file is not protected against unauthorized access when the `cookid` cookie is set to 1."
