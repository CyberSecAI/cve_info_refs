      "details": "This is a Debian Security Advisory (DSA) for httrack. It states that httrack is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing excessively long URLs which allows for arbitrary code execution. It mentions that the vulnerability can be triggered either locally or remotely and recommends updating to fixed versions. This confirms that the root cause is a buffer overflow, the weakness is improper URL validation, the impact is arbitrary code execution and the vector is long URLs passed as an argument. The Debian advisory also confirms the vulnerability is not specific to Debian."
