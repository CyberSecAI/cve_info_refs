How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# libxml2: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200812-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libxml2 might lead to execution of arbitrary
code or Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libxml2** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.7.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.7.2-r1** |

### Background

libxml2 is the XML (eXtended Markup Language) C parser and toolkit
initially developed for the Gnome project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were reported in libxml2:

* Andreas Solberg reported that libxml2 does not properly detect
  recursion during entity expansion in an attribute value
  (CVE-2008-3281).
* A heap-based buffer overflow has been reported in the
  xmlParseAttValueComplex() function in parser.c (CVE-2008-3529).
* Christian Weiske reported that predefined entity definitions in
  entities are not properly handled (CVE-2008-4409).
* Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported an integer overflow in the
  xmlBufferResize() function that can lead to an infinite loop
  (CVE-2008-4225).
* Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported an integer overflow in the
  xmlSAX2Characters() function leading to a memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-4226).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to open a
specially crafted XML document with an application using libxml2,
possibly resulting in the exeution of arbitrary code or a high CPU and
memory consumption.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libxml2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.7.2-r1"
```
### References

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: libxml2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0884)

## Topic

Updated libxml2 packages that fix a security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The libxml2 packages provide a library that allows you to manipulate XML
files. It includes support to read, modify, and write XML and HTML files.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 handled long
XML entity names. If an application linked against libxml2 processed
untrusted malformed XML content, it could cause the application to crash
or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3529)

All users of libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [libxml2](/security/cves?package=libxml2) -

## Details

It was discovered that libxml2 did not correctly handle root XML document

element DTD definitions. If a user were tricked into processing a specially

crafted XML document, a remote attacker could cause the application linked

against libxml2 to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-2414](/security/CVE-2009-2414))

It was discovered that libxml2 did not correctly parse Notation and

Enumeration attribute types. If a user were tricked into processing a

specially crafted XML document, a remote attacker could cause the

application linked against libxml2 to crash, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2009-2416](/security/CVE-2009-2416))

USN-644-1 fixed a vulnerability in libxml2. This advisory provides the

corresponding update for Ubuntu 9.04.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that libxml2 did not correctly handle long entity names.

If a user were tricked into processing a specially crafted XML document, a

remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges or cause

the application linked against libxml2 to crash, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2008-3529](/security/CVE-2008-3529))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- imlib2
Specially crafted xpm files could trigger a stack based buffer overflow
in imlib2 which could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2008-2426).
- mono
A bug in the ASP.net class library of mono allowed cross site
scripting attacks (CVE-2008-3422).
- tomcat5
Tomcat was updated to fix a cross site scripting issue and directory traversal
problems (CVE-2008-1232, CVE-2008-2370, CVE-2008-2938)
- libtiff
Specially crafted lzw files could trigger a buffer underflow in
libtiff (CVE-2008-2327).
- libxml2
Specially crafted xml files could cause a crash or a heap based
buffer overlow in libxml2 (CVE-2008-3281, CVE-2008-3529).
- clamav
Clamav has been updated to version 0.94. It fixes numerous problems
including some security relevant ones (CVE-2008-3912, CVE-2008-1389,
CVE-2008-3913, CVE-2008-3914).
This new version changed the library version number once again so
dependent packages had do be updated as well (clamav,
sylpheed-claws, claws-mail).
- emacs
When editing Python files Emacs accidently imported other Python
script in the current directory (CVE-2008-3949).
- php5
php5 has been updated to fix some overflows in the gd extension and
the memnstr() function that could crash php or even cause a buffer
overflow (CVE-2008-3658, CVE-2008-3659 and CVE-2008-3660)
- uvcvideo
The kernel driver uvcvideo was vulnerable to a buffer overflow in
format descriptor parsing code (CVE-2008-3496).
- postfix
When exectuting external programs postfix didn't close the file
descriptor of the epoll system call. This could potentially be
exploited to shutdown postfix (CVE-2008-3889).

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1654-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                               Steve Kemp
October 14, 2008                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : libxml2
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-3529
Debian Bug     : 498768

It was discovered that libxml2, the GNOME XML library, didn't correctly
handle long entity names.  This could allow the execution of arbitrary
code via a malicious XML file.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.27.dfsg-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.32.dfsg-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

This update addresses the issue by using a better random number generator. Credit to Amit Klein of Trusteer for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1697

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 2.2.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may result in a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: A CRLF injection issue exists in the handling of XMLHttpRequest headers in WebKit. This may allow a malicious website to bypass the same-origin policy by issuing an XMLHttpRequest that does not contain a Host header. XMLHttpRequests without a Host header may reach other websites on the same server, and allow attacker-supplied JavaScript to interact with those sites. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of XMLHttpRequest headers. Credit to Per von Zweigbergk for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1698

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 2.2.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1

  Impact: Viewing a maliciously crafted web page may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: An uninitialized pointer issue exists in the handling of the CSS 'attr' function. Viewing a maliciously crafted web page may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through additional validation of CSS elements. Credit to Thierry Zoller working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, and Robert Swiecki of the Google Security Team for reporting this as a security issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1699

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 2.2.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may result in an information disclosure

  Description: An XML External Entity issue exists in WebKit's handling of XML. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may result in the website being able to read files from the user's system. This update addresses the issue by not loading external entities across origins. Credit to Chris Evans of Google Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1700

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 2.2.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may result in the disclosure of sensitive information

  Description: WebKit does not properly handle redirects when processing Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT). This allows a maliciously crafted website to retrieve XML content from pages on other websites, which could result in the disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by ensuring that documents referenced in transformations are downloaded from the same domain as the transformation itself. Credit to Chris Evans of Google Inc. for reporting this issue.

  Description: A use-after-free issue exists in WebKit's handling of the JavaScript DOM. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of document elements. Credit to wushi & ling of team509 working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative for reporting this issue.

#### Safari 4.0

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1704

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Downloaded image files may be misidentified as HTML, leading to JavaScript execution without warning the user

  Description: Image files are 'safe' types that, once downloaded, are displayed by Safari without warning the user. An issue in Safari may cause it to be unable to identify the file type of certain local image files. In this case, Safari will examine the content of those files and may treat them as HTML. If a file contains JavaScript, it will be executed in the local context. For a downloaded file, this should not occur without first prompting the user. This issue is addressed by treating files of unknown type as generic binary data, and by correctly identifying the image file types known to have this issue. Credit to Sergio 'shadown' Alvarez of Recurity Labs GmbH for reporting this issue.

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1716

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: A local user may be able to read the contents of files being downloaded by other users

  Description: CFNetwork creates temporary files insecurely when downloading. A local user may be able to access another user's files as they are downloaded, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by downloading files to the user's secure temporary directory location. For Mac OS X systems, this issue is addressed in Mac OS X v10.5.6. Credit to Billy Rios and Microsoft Vulnerability Research for reporting this issue.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-2321

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: CoreGraphics contains memory corruption issues in the processing of arguments. Passing untrusted input to CoreGraphics via an application, such as a web browser, may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. For Mac OS X systems, this issue is addressed in Security Update 2008-005. Credit to Michal Zalewski of Google Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1705

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A memory corruption issue exists in the handling of TrueType fonts. An arithmetic issue in the automatic hinting of fonts may cause memory corruption. Visiting a maliciously crafted website with embedded fonts may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved input validation of TrueType font data. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems. Credit to Clint Ruoho of Laconic Security and Tavis Ormandy of Google Security Team for reporting this issue.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0946

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in FreeType v2.3.8

  Description: Multiple integer overflows exist in FreeType v2.3.8, that may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issues through improved bounds checking. These issues do not affect CoreGraphics on Mac OS X systems. Credit to Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team for reporting these issues.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0145

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: Multiple memory corruption issues exist in CoreGraphics' handling of PDF files. Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issues through improved bounds and error checking. For Mac OS X v10.5 systems, this issue is addressed in Mac OS X v10.5.7. For Mac OS X v10.4.11 systems, this issue is addressed in Security Update 2009-002.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1179

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: An integer overflow exists in CoreGraphics' handling of PDF files containing JBIG2 streams. Opening a PDF file containing a maliciously crafted JBIG2 stream may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. Credit to Will Dormann of CERT/CC for reporting this issue.

* **ImageIO**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0040

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Processing a maliciously crafted PNG image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: An uninitialized pointer issue exists in the handling of PNG images. Processing a maliciously crafted PNG image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue by performing additional validation of PNG images. Credit to Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team for reporting this issue.

* **International Components for Unicode**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0153

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Maliciously crafted content may bypass website filters and result in cross-site scripting

  Description: An implementation issue exists in ICU's handling of certain character encodings. Using ICU to convert invalid byte sequences to Unicode may result in over-consumption, where trailing bytes are considered part of the original character. This may be leveraged by an attacker to bypass filters on websites that attempt to mitigate cross-site scripting. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of invalid byte sequences. For Mac OS X v10.5 systems, this issue is addressed in Mac OS X v10.5.7. Credit to Chris Weber of Casaba Security for reporting this issue.

* **libxml**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3281, CVE-2008-3529, CVE-2008-4409, CVE-2008-4225, CVE-2008-4226

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in libxml2 version 2.6.16

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in libxml2 version 2.6.16, the most serious of which may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. On Windows, the issues are addressed by updating libxml2 to version 2.7.3. On Mac OS X v10.4.11 and Mac OS X v10.5.7, the issues are addressed by applying the relevant patches.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1682

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Visiting a website with a revoked EV certificate may not display a certificate warning

  Description: An issue in Safari's handling of Extended Validation (EV) certificates may cause the revocation checking to be bypassed. This would allow a page to be loaded without issuing a warning for a revoked EV certificate. This update addresses the issue through improved revocation checking for EV certificates. Credit to Bruce Morton for reporting this issue.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1706

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Cookies set during a private browsing session may remain after private browsing ends

  Description: Safari's Private Browsing feature is designed to allow users to browse without leaving evidence of the browser session on disk. An implementation issue in Private Browsing may cause cookies to remain on disk after Private Browsing ends. This may result in an unexpected disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by removing cookies from the alternate cookie store when private browsing is disabled, or Safari quits. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems. Credit to Michael Hay of Beatnik Monkey Software for reporting this issue.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1707

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: "Reset Safari" may not immediately remove website passwords from memory

  Description: After clicking the "Reset" button for "Reset saved names and passwords" in the "Reset Safari..." menu option, Safari may take up to 30 seconds to clear the passwords. A user with access to the system in that time window may be able to access the stored credentials. This issue is addressed by resolving the race condition that leads to the delay. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems. Credit to Philippe Couturier of izypage.com, and Andrew Wellington of The Australian National University for reporting this issue.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1708

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to the disclosure of local file content or arbitrary code execution

  Description: An issue in Safari's open-help-anchor URL handler may allow a maliciously crafted website to open local help files. This may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue by preventing remote sites from calling the open-help-anchor URL handler. Credit to Billy Rios and Microsoft Vulnerability Research for reporting this issue.

* **Safari Windows Installer**

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Safari may run with elevated privileges

  Description: The Safari installer includes a checkbox to launch Safari immediately after installation. If this checkbox is checked, the compression method in the installer will cause Safari to run with elevated privileges for its initial launch. The issue is addressed by using a different compression method in the installer. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems. Credit to Dave English of Lutnos for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2006-2783

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: WebKit ignores Unicode byte order mark sequences when parsing web pages. Certain websites and web content filters attempt to sanitize input by blocking specific HTML tags.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=461015#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-03 14:29:00 UTC  ``` It was discovered, that libxml2 does not properly handle long XML entity names.  In the xmlParseAttValueComplex() function in parser.c, when entity name is not substituted with entity value, but is sent to output unchanged, buffer used to store entity name may not be grown sufficiently in case of long entity names, resulting in a heap buffer overflow.  Issue is already fixed upstream in version 2.7.0.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=461015#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-03 14:37:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 315648](attachment.cgi?id=315648&action=diff "Proposed patch from Daniel Veillard (against 2.6.32)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=315648&action=edit "Proposed patch from Daniel Veillard (against 2.6.32)") Proposed patch from Daniel Veillard (against 2.6.32)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=461015#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-11 13:08:04 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

libxml2 security update (RHSA-2008-0884)

Original Release Date: October 13, 2008

Last Revised: July 1, 2009

Number: ASA-2008-400

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 6.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The libxml2 packages provide a library that allows you to manipulate
XML
files. It includes support to read, modify, and write XML and HTML
files.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libxml2
handled long
XML entity names. If an application linked against libxml2 processed
untrusted malformed XML content, it could cause the application to crash
or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2008-3529](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3529) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

**Recommended Actions:**
For all vulnerable system products,
Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions:**

supplied by RedHat Linux.
