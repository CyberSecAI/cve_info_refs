        "content": "This document provides detailed information about CVE-2008-3460. \n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap corruption vulnerability exists due to the way Microsoft Office handles WordPerfect Graphics (WPG) format image files.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Office parses the length of a WPG file before passing it to the allocated buffer, leading to potential heap corruption.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to take complete control of an affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with the same user rights as the logged-on user. The severity is rated as 'Critical' for Office 2000 SP3 and 'Important' for other affected versions.\n\n**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by opening a specially crafted WPG file, or a WordPerfect document with a malformed WPG image embedded. This could be achieved through malicious e-mail attachments or compromised websites.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to create a specially crafted WPG file and convince a user to open the file with an affected Microsoft Office application. User interaction is required for successful exploitation. An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability gains the same user rights as the local user. Users with administrative rights will be more severely affected. The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through a web-based attack scenario. The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious web site, typically by getting them to click a link, and then convince the user to open the file in an affected Microsoft Office application."
