```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the 'id' parameter of the `product_desc.php` and `store_info.php` scripts.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as admin usernames and passwords, by injecting malicious SQL queries into the vulnerable parameter.
- Attack vectors: The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing SQL injection payloads in the `id` parameter of the `product_desc.php` and `store_info.php` scripts.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
