  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation in the `mojoJobs.cgi` script when handling the `cat_a` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Blind SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including user passwords.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific privileges or local access is required."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "exploit_code": "The provided exploit code demonstrates how to extract the MD5 hash of the first user's password by manipulating the `cat_a` parameter in the `mojoJobs.cgi` URL using SQL injection techniques.",
        "more_info": "The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, where the attacker does not receive direct feedback from the database, but infers results based on the response of the web application. The exploit uses substring and character comparison to extract data, bit by bit. It searches for the presence of `tourterms.pdf` in the response, indicating a successful match."
