{
  "CVE-2008-3465": {
    "Root cause": "A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the way that GDI handles file size parameters in WMF files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could take complete control of an affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts. On Windows Vista and Server 2008, it could also lead to a denial of service by making the application non-responsive.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation requires a third-party application to use a specific Microsoft API to copy a specially crafted WMF image file. Depending on the application's behavior, this could lead to remote code execution.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted WMF image file. They also need to be able to get a user to use a vulnerable third-party application to copy the file using the Microsoft API.",
    "Additional details": "This vulnerability is triggered when GDI improperly processes a malformed file size parameter in a WMF file. The vulnerability is rated as 'Moderate' for older systems, and 'Low' for Windows Vista and Server 2008 due to the impact only being denial of service on these systems. The BitBlaze project at Carnegie Mellon University and UC Berkeley is credited with reporting this vulnerability."
