Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-3663:

**Summary:**

CVE-2008-3663 is a session hijacking vulnerability in Squirrelmail. It stems from the application not setting the "secure" flag on session cookies. This allows an attacker to potentially intercept the session cookie over an insecure HTTP connection, even if the user is primarily using HTTPS, leading to session hijacking.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the failure to set the "secure" flag on session cookies generated by Squirrelmail.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application does not enforce that session cookies are only transmitted over secure (HTTPS) connections.
    *   **Missing Secure Flag:** The absence of the "secure" flag on the session cookie allows it to be sent over HTTP.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:**  An attacker can intercept a legitimate user's session cookie.
    *   **Account Impersonation:** With a hijacked cookie, the attacker can impersonate the user and gain access to their Squirrelmail account.
    *   **Information Exposure:** The attacker can potentially access and manipulate the user's emails and other sensitive data within the Squirrelmail account.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker on the same network as the victim can eavesdrop on HTTP traffic.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker positioned between the victim and the server can intercept the cookie during an HTTP request.
    *   **HTTP downgrade:** An attacker can induce the user to make an initial HTTP request to the SquirrelMail server, which will leak the cookie over an insecure channel.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Proximity:**  The attacker needs to be in a position to monitor the victim's network traffic or be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
    *   **Passive or Active Interception:** The attacker can passively monitor traffic or actively manipulate it.
    *   **Knowledge of Vulnerable System:** The attacker needs to know the target is using a vulnerable version of Squirrelmail.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in Squirrelmail version 1.4.16 and later by ensuring the "secure" flag is set on session cookies.
*   **Vendor Notification:** The vulnerability was reported to the Squirrelmail developers on August 12, 2008, and a public advisory was released on September 23, 2008.
*   **Real-world Example:** A presentation at DEF CON 16 discussed this vulnerability.
*   **OpenSUSE:** SUSE also released a security report that included a fix for this vulnerability. They also noted that a previous attempt to fix it had introduced a new bug with static cookies.
* **Apple:**  A security update from Apple also references CVE-2008-3663, indicating SquirrelMail is used on some Apple products, likely servers.
