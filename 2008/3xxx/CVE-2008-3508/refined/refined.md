  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure cookie handling",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The admin panel only checks if a cookie exists, not its value or origin, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain administrative access to the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects a crafted cookie via Javascript, specifically setting the cookie 'admin=1'.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute Javascript within the context of the vulnerable application in the victim's browser."
