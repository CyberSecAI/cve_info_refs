  "CVE-2008-3302": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "Multiple vulnerabilities were found in bilboblog 2.1, including login bypass, cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and full path disclosure.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "type": "Login Bypass",
        "root_cause": "The application improperly handles session variables when `register_globals` is enabled in PHP. The variables `$login` and `$password` are not properly initialized, allowing an attacker to set them through the URL and gain admin access.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper session handling",
          "Reliance on `register_globals`"
        ],
        "impact": "Unauthorized administrative access",
         "attack_vector": "By sending a crafted GET request to admin/login.php with login and password parameters set in the URL, and submitting the login form with the same values."
      },
       {
        "type": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "root_cause": "The application uses `stripslashes()` and `html_entity_decode()` on user-supplied content in the `widget.php` file, which is not properly sanitized. Additionally, XSS is possible via the titleId parameter in index.php.  Unsanitized user input is also present in admin files and footer.php",
         "weaknesses":[
           "Improper output encoding",
           "Lack of input sanitization"
         ],
        "impact": "Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the victim's browser",
         "attack_vector": "By injecting malicious code in the content of a blog post (permanent XSS) or by including malicious code in the titleId query parameter (unpermanent XSS).  Other XSS vectors are via crafted GET parameters"
      },
      {
        "type": "SQL Injection",
        "root_cause": "The application does not sanitize user-supplied input when deleting articles. The `delete.php` script directly inserts the `num` parameter into a SQL query.",
         "weaknesses": [
           "Lack of input sanitization",
           "Improperly constructed SQL query"
         ],
        "impact": "Data manipulation, such as deletion of all articles in the database. The attack could be leveraged to potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.",
         "attack_vector": "By sending a POST request to delete.php with a crafted num parameter."
       },
      {
       "type": "Full Path Disclosure",
        "root_cause": "The application outputs the full server path in error messages when `enable_cache` is set to `false` in `footer.php` and when calling `pagination.php`.",
       "weaknesses": [
         "Improper error handling",
         "Exposing sensitive information"
       ],
        "impact": "Information disclosure that could be used to further attacks or enumerate file structure.",
        "attack_vector": "By accessing `footer.php?enable_cache=false` and `pagination.php`."
      }
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application to exploit the flaws. Some vulnerabilities, such as the admin bypass, also require PHP register_globals to be enabled, and for the SQLi to work magic_quotes must be off. To exploit XSS, an attacker needs to either gain admin access (to post malicious content) or have a victim click a malicious URL."
