{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The `list.php` script in CodeDB 1.1.1 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient input sanitization of the `lang` parameter.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
        "Insufficient input validation/sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files by manipulating the `lang` parameter, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information like configuration files, source code, or even system files.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP GET requests to the `list.php` script, where the `lang` parameter is manipulated to include local files.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed.",
       "additional_details": "The application uses `htmlspecialchars()` on the `lang` parameter, however, this function doesn't prevent path traversal.  The vulnerability is triggered because the application uses a combination of `file_exists()` and `include()` with the unsanitized input, after prepending `templates/` and appending `_middle.php` to the path.  The null byte `%00` can be used to truncate the filename allowing for arbitrary file inclusion."
