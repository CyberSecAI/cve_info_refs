- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - The Microworld MailScan application's web-based administration interface, running as an HTTP service on TCP port 10443 with LocalSystem privileges, has multiple vulnerabilities due to insecure handling of requests and access control. The communication occurs over plain HTTP without SSL/TLS.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Directory Traversal: Allows access to files outside the webroot with LocalSystem privileges using `../` sequences in the URL.
    - Authentication Bypass:  Access to admin interface is granted without authentication by simply requesting a resource without providing a cookie, also, the cookie is easily forged to gain admin access.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks.
    - Log File Access: Log files are accessible without authentication due to the unprotected `/LOG` directory within the webroot.
    - Weak Password Algorithm: The application uses a weak password hashing algorithm, allowing easy password recovery.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Remote attackers can read sensitive files on the server.
    - Remote attackers can bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the application.
    - Remote attackers can execute arbitrary Javascript in the context of the web application.
    - Sensitive information, such as installation paths, IP addresses, and error messages, can be disclosed via log files.
    - Attackers can retrieve admin passwords.
- Attack vectors:
    - Sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web interface on TCP port 10443.
    - Manipulating cookies to gain administrative access.
    - Injecting Javascript code via crafted URLs.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server on TCP port 10443.
    - No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerabilities.
