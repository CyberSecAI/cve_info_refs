  "CVE-2008-3015": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI+ handles integer calculations. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted BMP image file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow when GDI+ improperly processes a malformed header in a specially crafted BMP image file. Specifically, an integer overflow occurs during header processing, leading to the heap overflow.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow",
        "Heap-based Buffer Overflow",
         "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could install programs, view or modify data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Opening a specially crafted BMP image file via email or web browser"
   ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious BMP image file with a malformed header. They must also induce a user to open this crafted file. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability"
