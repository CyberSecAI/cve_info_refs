MyBB 1.2.14 is a security and maintenance update to MyBB 1.2 fixing a low HTML Injection vulnerability. This release is also intended to fix the rest of MyBB 1.2's outstanding bugs and provide a stable platform for those of you who wish to stay with the the MyBB 1.2 platform for a while after 1.4 is released.  This security update fixes:  * [Low Risk] HTML Injection vulnerability  These vulnerabilities affect MyBB 1.2.13 and previous releases of MyBB 1.2. Older versions of MyBB may also be affected.  Information on upgrading, template changes and language changes can be found in the posts below.  Please note, that you need to run the upgrade script for this version. This is so the templates may be updated.  There are no database schema changes in this version.   Reporting MyBB security vulnerabilities If you think you've found a vulnerability in MyBB, we advise you not to publicly post it on these forums or publicly release information about it elsewhere until we've had time to prepare and release a patch.  As always, you can send through security related messages on the MyBB website from the [Contact Us](http://www.mybboard.net/contact/) page.  A final note... I would like to thank all the staff members, beta testers, translators, mod authors, theme authors, and most of all, you. We appreciate everyone's dedication towards MyBB, as this release marks the end of our journey with the 1.2 series, which started over 2 years ago.

Follow the general [[Wiki: Upgrading]](http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Upgrading "View the MyBB Wiki page for Upgrading") *(Broken link, head over to docs.mybb.com instead)* guide outlined on the MyBB Wiki to complete the upgrade process. You may download a ZIP archive of changed files here:   .zip   [mybb\_1214\_changed\_files.zip](attachment.php?aid=9881 "2008-07-18, 12:37 AM") (Size: 278.2 KB / Downloads: 4,501)   You must then check for modified templates using the instructions in the next post.  Upgrading from other versions If you are upgrading from a version earlier than 1.2 then you will lose your custom themes, templates and language packs due to the number of changes between your version and the 1.2 series.  Before you attempt to upgrade, ensure you have a database backup and a copy of the files currently in use on your board. This is so you can revert back to your earlier version if you need to or something goes horribly wrong with the upgrade process.  Follow the general [[Wiki: Upgrading]](http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Upgrading "View the MyBB Wiki page for Upgrading") *(Broken link, head over to docs.mybb.com instead)* guide outlined on the MyBB Wiki to complete the upgrade process.

After identifying changed templates using the tool you can either revert your custom template to the default (delete it) or use the "diff" tool to perform a difference analysis on your custom template and the default.  Since MyBB 1.2.12 the following templates have been changed.  A revert for this release is not required so your custom version of the template should work perfectly fine.  Template changes Since MyBB 1.2.12 the following templates have had changes to them:  * misc\_imcenter\_icq   Language file changes Since MyBB 1.2.12 the following language files have had changes to them:  * search.lang.php * global.lang.php  Either update your language packs to include the changes in these files or revert to the standard English language pack.  Plugins Your MyBB 1.2.x plugins will work correctly with 1.2.14 without any updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
