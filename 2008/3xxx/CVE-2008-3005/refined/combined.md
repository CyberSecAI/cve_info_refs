# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-043 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Excel Could Allow Remote Code Execution (954066)

Published: August 12, 2008 | Updated: October 01, 2008

**Version:** 1.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves four privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Excel that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Excel file. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft Office Excel 2000 Service Pack 3 and rated Important for Excel 2002 Service Pack 3, Excel 2003 Service Pack 2, Excel 2003 Service Pack 3, Excel Viewer 2003, Excel Viewer 2003 Service Pack 3, Excel 2007, Excel 2007 Service Pack 1, Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats, Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats Service Pack 1, Microsoft Office Excel Viewer, and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

This security update addresses these vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Excel performs validations when opening Excel files. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

**Known Issues.** None

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

#### FAQ for Excel Indexing Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3004

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Excel does not perform sufficient validation of index values when loading Excel files into memory.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a malformed Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site and then convince them to open the file.

A Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 attack scenario is similar to a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host an Excel Services Web Part in Office SharePoint Server 2007 that is used to render (open) a specially crafted Excel file. An attacker would need permissions to create Excel Services Web Parts and upload Excel files, and then convince users to visit the Web site containing the web part.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Excel used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Excel validates index values when loading Excel files into memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. This security bulletin addresses the privately disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

#### FAQ for Excel Record Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3006

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

The scope of the vulnerability is determined by the attack scenario.

An attack against a user's local Excel client can result in remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

An attack against a Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 site can result in elevation of privilege. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain an elevation of privilege within SharePoint server, as opposed to elevation of privilege within the workstation or server environment.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Excel does not perform sufficient validation when parsing record values when loading Excel files into memory.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In an attack against a user's local Excel client, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

In an attack against a SharePoint site, an attacker would need an account in the SharePoint site with sufficient rights to upload a specially crafted Excel file and create a web part using the file on the SharePoint Site. As the SharePoint site creates the web part based on specially crafted records within the Excel file, the vulnerability could allow the attacker to run code with elevated privileges within the SharePoint server.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In an attack against a user's local Excel client, there are several scenarios such as a local attack, an email attack, or a Web-based attack, that an attacker could use to exploit the vulnerability.

In the local attack scenario, the vulnerability requires that a user open a malformed Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a malformed Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

In an attack against a SharePoint site, an attacker would need an account in the SharePoint site with sufficient rights to upload a specially crafted Excel file and create a web part using the file on the SharePoint Site. As the SharePoint site creates the web part based on specially crafted records within the Excel file, the vulnerability could allow the attacker to run code with elevated privileges within the SharePoint server.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

For local Excel client, systems where Microsoft Excel is used are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

For SharePoint sites, systems that are running SharePoint Server 2007, are primarily at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability in both the Excel client and SharePoint Server by modifying the way that Microsoft Excel validates record values when loading Excel files into memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. This security bulletin addresses the privately disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Workarounds for Excel Credential Caching Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3003

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality.

* **Edit the connections.xml inside the .xlsx file and manually remove the password**

  **Windows Shell method:**

  1. Create a backup copy of the affected .xlsx file before making your edits.
  2. On a Windows XP or Windows Vista computer, change the file name extension of the affected .xlsx file to .zip.
  3. Using Windows Explorer, open the ZIP file by double-clicking on it and then double-click on the **xl** folder inside.
  4. In the **xl** folder, click on 'connections.xml' and drag it out of the ZIP file to a local folder or your desktop.
  5. Using the right mouse button, click the **connections.xml** file to see a shortcut menu. In the menu, click **Open With** and then choose **Notepad**.
  6. In Notepad, locate the string "connection=" and then search for "PWD=" later in that string. Remove any characters after the âPWD=â and before the â;â characters as these are the improperly saved credentials for the connection.
  7. Save the connections.xml file and close Notepad.
  8. Drag the connections.xml file back into the ZIP folder making sure to place it in the **xl** folder inside the ZIP file.

     **NOTE**: Some applications such as Winzip will default to placing the file at the root of the ZIP archive and will not overwrite the file in the 'xl' folder by default. For instructions on how to use Winzip to update the file see the **WinZip method** section below.
  9. Change the file name extension of the ZIP file back to .xlsx.
  10. Open the document in Excel 2007, click the **Data** menu and then click **refresh all** in the connections part of the ribbon. Verify that you are prompted for the password.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
