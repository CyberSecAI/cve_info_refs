Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-1531:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how `lighttpd` handles SSL errors, specifically during the SSL shutdown process. When an SSL connection encounters an error, `lighttpd` attempts to shut down the connection, but it doesn't properly handle the return values of `SSL_shutdown` calls in non-blocking mode. This leads to error codes from previous `SSL_shutdown` calls being propagated to later `SSL_write` operations, causing other valid SSL connections to be dropped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Error Handling:** `lighttpd` fails to clear the SSL error queue after an `SSL_shutdown` call returns an error, resulting in subsequent operations receiving incorrect error codes.
*   **Lack of Proper SSL Shutdown:** The server did not handle the bidirectional SSL shutdown correctly, specifically in non-blocking mode.
*   **DoS Condition**: By triggering an SSL error, an attacker can force the server to close other, valid SSL connections

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause other active SSL connections to be terminated. This can affect users with longer-pending connections like downloads or keep-alive connections.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attack is triggered by a remote attacker who connects to the server over SSL.
*   **Triggering an SSL error:** The attacker needs to initiate a connection, trigger an SSL error (e.g., prematurely closing their connection) which will result in the targeted connections being dropped.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the `lighttpd` server over SSL.
*   **Ability to trigger SSL errors**: The attacker needs to be able to cause a connection error (e.g. disconnecting prematurely)

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `lighttpd` versions prior to 1.4.19-r2.
*   The initial fix for the issue in 1.4.19 was not complete, requiring further patches.
*   The vulnerability is related to the "SSL3_WRITE_PENDING: bad write retry" error message observed in logs.
*   The vulnerability was resolved by fixing the SSL error handling logic during shutdown and using `ERR_clear_error()` before `ssl_write` and `ssl_read` calls.
