| [Description](#c0)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-26 15:30:00 UTC  ``` lighttpd-1.4.19 and earlier contain a bug which can be exploited by a malicious user to forcefully close foreign SSL connections. To exploit this, the server has to have SSL support enabled and the attacker has to trigger an SSL error on his own connection (connecting and disconnecting before the download has finished is enough).  Original ticket: <http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/ticket/285#comment:19> Fix: <http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/changeset/2136>  lighttpd-1.4.19 was supposed to fix the problem, but the fix did not work as expected, so it is still vulnerable.  The damage, which can be caused by this bug is rather low, I'd say: Firstly, users can simply reconnect after their connection has been killed, and secondly, it is hard for an attacker to meet the exact point of time to crash a user's connection, it is mostly a problem when there are longer-pending connections such as downloads or keepalive. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thilo Bangert (RETIRED) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-26 20:24:07 UTC  ``` 1.4.19-r1 is in the tree  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-26 20:44:35 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable: =www-servers/lighttpd-1.4.19-r1 Target keywords : "alpha amd64 arm hppa ia64 ppc ppc64 release sh sparc x86"  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Markus Meier   gentoo-dev  2008-03-26 22:01:39 UTC  ``` amd64/x86 stable ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-26 22:46:54 UTC  ``` I fail, sorry.  The fix does not seem completely right again... it makes lighty enter some kind of infinite loop in case of SSL errors, printing lots of SSL error messages and consuming lots of CPU.  Working on it. Drop stable again? p.mask? ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-26 22:50:44 UTC  ``` amd64, x86, please read above. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Markus Meier   gentoo-dev  2008-03-26 22:59:19 UTC  ``` amd64/x86 unstable :) ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-26 23:27:45 UTC  ``` bangert, I commented on the upstream ticket [1] with a possible new patch against 1.4.19 [2]. It works fine for me, but I'd rather have the OK from a lighty dev (they've been very responsive today, so I think we should get one pretty soon).  Sorry again for all the confusion and b0rkage. :(   [1] <http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/ticket/285#comment:21> [2] <http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/attachment/ticket/285/06_all_lighttpd-1.4.19-closing_foreign_ssl_connections-dos.diff> ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Bertrand Jacquin    2008-03-26 23:38:47 UTC  ``` <http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/ticket/1601> should be taken in account too :) ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-26 23:45:46 UTC  ``` Bertrand, thanks for the pointer, I saw that one already and I don't think it should be considered a vulnerability. It's a bug that lighty does not handle this situation more gracefully, but I don't see how an attacker could gain something by "exploiting" this bug. After setting up lighty or making config changes, one will immediately (after trying to send a request) see that the new config is wrong (as lighty crashes). Or... expressed differently: No working site will have such a config and as such nobody can exploit it. At least that's my interpretation. =) ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Bertrand Jacquin    2008-03-26 23:54:25 UTC  ``` You're right, I didn't see the "only security" point. My fault.  ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Lars Hartmann    2008-03-28 10:43:45 UTC  ``` please add "CVE-CVE-2008-1531" ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-28 17:17:25 UTC  ``` New patch from upstream [1], see the relevant ticket [2]. I created a diff against 1.4.19 [3] which is what we'll probably need. :) Hopefully I tested it well enough this time. :p   [1] <http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/changeset/2139> [2] <http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/ticket/285#comment:26> [3] <http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/attachment/ticket/285/committed-patch-1.4.19.patch> ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Joe User    2008-03-30 19:05:26 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=214892#c7)) > [2] <http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/attachment/ticket/285/06_all_lighttpd-1.4.19-closing_foreign_ssl_connections-dos.diff>   That patch flooded my error.log with gigs of following errmsg bringing my server to start swapping and stopping to respond: 2008-03-30 20:39:10: (connections.c.1684) SSL: 5 error:00000000:lib(0):func(0):reason(0)   devnull ~ # emerge -pv lighttpd  These are the packages that would be merged, in order:  Calculating dependencies... done!

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:03:45 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached Numeric-20.3.ebuild.  This is an update for use with python-2.1  It can be tested by starting a python shell (need a PPM image viewer installed: tkinter will suffice) and >>>from NumTut import * >>>view(greece)  should see a pretty picture.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:05:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10](attachment.cgi?id=10 "Numeric-20.3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=10&action=edit "Numeric-20.3.ebuild")] Numeric-20.3.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:06:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 11](attachment.cgi?id=11 "Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=11&action=edit "Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff")] Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 21:17:27 UTC  ``` This ebuild gives a Access violtion when run through the sandbox.  --------------------------- ACCESS VIOLATION SUMMARY ---------------------------LOG FILE = "/tmp/sandbox-Numeric-20.3-15709.log"  unlink:    /usr/lib/python2.1/distutils/command/install_headers.pyc open_wr:   /usr/lib/python2.1/distutils/command/install_headers.pyc -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-05 03:51:53 UTC  ``` The sandbox violation seems to be python version related.  I don't get a violation building against python-2.2. I even doubted that sandbox was working so I added a 'echo "fail" > /home/tod/tmp/fail.test' to the ebuild install function, and it then generated a access violation (sandbox is nice!).    Bottom line.  The simple fix seems to be change the depends to >=python-2.2 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-10 07:34:59 UTC  ``` added dep on >=python 2.2   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : lighttpd
Vulnerability  : DOS
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1531

It was discovered that lighttpd, a fast webserver with minimal memory
footprint, was didn't correctly handle SSL errors.  This could allow

#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- rsync heap overflow in xattr code
A remotely exploitable heap overflow in rsync's xattr code has
been fixed. CVE-2008-1720 has been assigned to this issue.
rsync was fixed on openSUSE 10.3.
- MozillaFirefox 2.0.0.14 security release
Mozilla Firefox was brought to security update version 2.0.0.14.
Following security problems were fixed:
- MFSA 2008-20/CVE-2008-1380: Fixes for security problems in the
JavaScript engine described in MFSA 2008-15 (CVE-2008-1237) introduced
a stability problem, where some users experienced frequent crashes
during JavaScript garbage collection. These crashes may be exploitable
if someone finds a reliable way to trigger the crash.
We were not able to reproduce the crashes internally. Updates have been
released on SLE 10, SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- poppler PDF problems
Specially crafted PDF files with embedded fonts could potentially be
abused to trick applications that process PDF files into executing
arbitrary code (CVE-2008-1693).
Fixes for poppler for all distributions containing poppler have
been released.
- nagios cross site scripting problems
Several cross site scripting (XSS) issues in nagios were fixed
(CVE-2007-5624, CVE-2007-5803, CVE-2008-1360).
SLE 10, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 received fixed nagios packages.
- lighttpd SSL denial of service
The web server lighttpd had a problem, where an error in one
SSL connection could lead to termination of all SSL connections
(CVE-2008-1531)
This problem has been fixed in SLE 10, SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE
10.2 and 10.3.
- sarg various buffer overflows
Multiple stack buffer overflows have been fixed in the Squid logfile
analyzer sarg. (CVE-2008-1922)
sarg updates have been released for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2
and 10.3.
- squid denial of service fix
A flaw in a previous security update could cause squid to crash
under certain circumstances (CVE-2008-1612).
squid was updated on all distributions.
- bzip2 decoder denial of service
Specially crafted files could crash the bzip2-decoder
(CVE-2008-1372).
bzip2 was updated on all distributions.
- kdelibs3 unix signal handling
Start\_kdeinit did not handle unix signals the right way
(CVE-2008-1671)
This was only a problem in openSUSE 10.3 and fixed there.
- texlive-bin dvips overflows
Buffer overflows in dvips and dviljk could be triggered by specially
crafted dvi files (CVE-2007-5935, CVE-2007-5937). dvips additionally
created temporary files in an insecure manner (CVE-2007-5936).
Only openSUSE 10.3 updates were missing for this issue, the others
were released several weeks ago already.
- kdelibs4 heap overflow in PNG loader of KHTML
A heap overflow in the PNG loader of KHTML has been
fixed. CVE-2008-1670 has been assigned to this issue.
Only openSUSE 10.3 was affected and fixed.
- Sun Java 1.6.0 u6 security update
Sun Java was updated to 1.6.0u6 to fix several bugs and potentially
also security problems.
Sun has however not published any details regarding Security
Vulnerabilities in this update.
Only openSUSE 10.3 contains Sun Java 1.6.0 and was fixed.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# lighttpd: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200804-08**

Multiple vulnerabilities in lighttpd may lead to information disclosure or
a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/lighttpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.19-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.19-r2** |

### Background

lighttpd is a lightweight high-performance web server.

### Description

Julien Cayzax discovered that an insecure default setting exists in
mod\_userdir in lighttpd. When userdir.path is not set the default value
used is $HOME. It should be noted that the "nobody" user's $HOME is "/"
(CVE-2008-1270). An error also exists in the SSL connection code which
can be triggered when a user prematurely terminates his connection
(CVE-2008-1531).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit the first vulnerability to read
arbitrary files. The second vulnerability can be exploited by a remote
attacker to cause a Denial of Service by terminating a victim's SSL
connection.

### Workaround

As a workaround for CVE-2008-1270 you can set userdir.path to a
sensible value, e.g. *"public\_html"*.

### Resolution

All lighttpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/lighttpd-1.4.19-r2"
```
### References

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

PowerPC CPUs can operate in two modes: *big-endian* and *little-endian*.

* The **ppc** and **ppc64** stages are *big-endian* stages and can be used with *any PowerPC* CPU, including some old Apple™ hardware.
* The **ppc64le** stages are *little-endian* stages and are created for running on *POWER8 and newer* CPUs.
* The **power9le** stages are *little-endian* stages optimized exclusively for *POWER9* CPUs.

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

**Description**

I'm seeing a gazillion log entries like these:

2005-09-22 17:41:44: (network\_openssl.c.102) SSL: 1 -1 error:1409F07F:SSL routines:SSL3\_WRITE\_PENDING:bad write retry
2005-09-22 17:41:44: (connections.c.494) connection closed: write failed on fd 11

The page fails to complete writing. When I view the page in non-ssl mode, the page runs to completion.

This bug is about "SSL3\_WRITE\_PENDING:bad write retry", not "handshake failure".

I think the problem is the "evil hack"/workaround for opera in network\_openssl.c:

It modifies c->mem, which could have already been used for SSL\_write with an SSL\_ERROR\_WANT\_WRITE error, so we could get a new c->mem->ptr which results in the "bad write retry" error.

2 possible solutions:
 - Remove the hack
 - Delay every chunk till the next is available or connection is closed
I prefer the first - Opera users just have to update their browsers. (Bug in <= 9.01 / 8.54)

It would be nice, if someone could test the patch/give information on how to reproduce the bug.

* **Status** changed from *Fixed* to *Need Feedback*
* **Resolution** deleted (~~*fixed*~~)

I run into the same problem as bug 258 with the SSL write errors.

Finally I could track down it to the following situation. Start two
parallel downloads using SSL in two different connections. (You can also
download through x-sendfile, or php output. I used wget for easier
reproduce and with large files to have long-lasting connections.)

Now terminate one of them and the other would be closed a bit latter. It
is very annoying as this way large downloads would probably terminate
before finishing.

The log would contain something like this:
2008-03-12 09:41:42: (network\_openssl.c.130) SSL: 1 -1 error:1409F07F:SSL routines:SSL3\_WRITE\_PENDING:bad write retry
2008-03-12 09:41:42: (connections.c.614) connection closed: write failed on fd 10

The log refers to the second connection which is closed by lighty.

I started debugging the situation an it looked like the SSL error is
generated in ssl3\_write\_pending function, which happens when the
repeated SSL\_write does not have the same arguments as the previous one,
or an other ssl\_write is called in between.
I checked these, but everything seemed to be fine.

Also tried a fix from openssl, but without any success:
<http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=598>

However after careful gdb magic the back-trace showed me that the error
function was called from SSL\_shutdown and not from SSL\_write. The
SSL\_shutdown was also called from the connection\_state\_machine function
on the CON\_STATE\_ERROR state. Hmm, strange, according to the logs the
error occurred somewhere else...

The SSL\_write failed in network\_write\_chunkqueue\_openssl, I realized the
in reality the SSL\_write was OK, it only returned SSL\_ERROR\_WANT\_WRITE,
but the SSL error queue contained an other error from an earlier SSL\_\*
call, in our case from SSL\_shutdown.

In connection\_state\_machine:

1663 case CON\_STATE\_ERROR: /\* transient **/
1664
1665 /** even if the connection was drop we still have to write it to the access log **/
1666 if (con->http\_status) {
1667 plugins\_call\_handle\_request\_done(srv, con);
1668 }
1669 #ifdef USE\_OPENSSL
1670 if (srv\_sock->is\_ssl) {
1671 int ret;
1672 switch ((ret = SSL\_shutdown(con->ssl))) {
1673 case 1:
1674 /** ok \*/
1675 break;
1676 case 0:
1677 SSL\_shutdown(con->ssl);
1678 break;
1679 default:
1680 log\_error\_write(srv, FILE\_, LINE\_, "sds", "SSL:",
1681 SSL\_get\_error(con->ssl, ret),
1682 ERR\_error\_string(ERR\_get\_error(), NULL));
1683 return -1;
1684 }
1685 }
1686 #endif

On line 1677 SSL\_shutdown is called again, because the connection is in
non-blocking mode where the first SSL\_shutdown can require an other
call. The problem that the return value of SSL\_shutdown is not checked
and in case of error the error queue is not cleared.

When the SSL\_write in network\_write\_chunkqueue\_openssl returned a simple
WANT\_WRITE error it got the error code from the previous SSL\_shutdown
call.

To fix the problem simply we need to check the return value of
SSL\_shutdown in 1677 and call ERR\_get\_error() to remove the error code
from the queue.

An other possible place is in connections.c:1557, but there is no
SSL\_shutdown just a FIXME to put it there sometimes when fdevent show
that connection is writeable. (This part is a more frequently run one,
so would have caused more trouble...)

Here is a patch for 1.4.19 r2135, but would be obvious to port to 1.5
series:

Index: connections.c
===================================================================
--- connections.c (revision 2135)
++ connections.c (working copy)
`@ -1674,7 +1674,15` @
 /\* ok **/
 break;
 case 0:
- SSL\_shutdown(con->ssl);** /
+ \* We need to get the error after SSH\_shutdown, otherwise it remains
+ \* on the error queue and causes latter false-alerts. Usually around
+ \* SSL\_write methods in network\_openssl.c which results to shutdown
+ \* of connections.
+ \*/
+ if (SSL\_shutdown(con->ssl) <= 0) {
+ ERR\_get\_error();
+ }
 break;
 default:
 log\_error\_write(srv, FILE\_, LINE\_, "sds", "SSL:",

At least now I learned a lot about lightty and openssl internals. :)

cheers,

Marton

PS: According to google it looks like CUPS has also similar problems...

Good catch!

Fixed in r2136.

I just added some ERR\_clear\_error() before ssl\_write and sll\_read to make really sure no old errors are hanging in the queue.

Excellent news!

It's early since 1.4.19, but if this tests out well, might I suggest that the importance of the fix justifies another release?

Thanks for your good work.

This is actually a DoS problem, I requested a CVE for it.

The fix does not properly work for me. Lighty no longer drops SSL connections, but it tries to properly close the broken connection, leading to *lots of* SSL error messages and very high CPU consumption.
I'll try to post an updated patch in a minute.

#### Updated by [hoffie](/users/5) [almost 17 years](/projects/lighttpd/activity?from=2008-03-26 "2008-03-26 23:24") ago

I attached a patch, which works without problems for me now (no drop of foreign SSL connections, no endless loop, no countless SSL errors).

I'm not completely sure whether it is correct regarding to logging -- according to the man page of SSL\_Shutdown a bidirectional SSL shutdown (that's what this is all about) is optional. With my patch applied, no logging takes place if the second part of the shutdown fails (the "ok, i'll shutdown" from the client). IMO that's fine, but as I said, I'm not sure and it is not me who has to decide.

Function-wise, the patch should be correct, but further testing is certainly appreciated.

* **Status** changed from *Need Feedback* to *Fixed*
* **Resolution** set to *fixed*

Ok, summary for now:
 CVE-2008-1531 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-1531>)
 - lighttpd-1.4.x: Fixed in r2136, r2139, r2141, r2142 (the first two are the real fixes, the other two change the NEWS file to contain the CVE)
 - lighttpd-1.5.x: Fixed in r2140

The problem was: if a user killed his ssl connection, lighttpd would kill another ssl connection as it didn't clear the ssl error queue.

simoncpu: this bug reports lists tons of error descriptions, some valid, some invalid, and is quite old and closed.

You really have to be more specific, and i even recommend opening a new ticket to avoid more confusion.
Also please try the latest 1.4.x svn (or the 1.4.30rc2 snapshot in <http://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/snapshots-1.4.x/>).

**Description**

I'm seeing a gazillion log entries like these:

2005-09-22 17:41:44: (network\_openssl.c.102) SSL: 1 -1 error:1409F07F:SSL routines:SSL3\_WRITE\_PENDING:bad write retry
2005-09-22 17:41:44: (connections.c.494) connection closed: write failed on fd 11

The page fails to complete writing. When I view the page in non-ssl mode, the page runs to completion.

This bug is about "SSL3\_WRITE\_PENDING:bad write retry", not "handshake failure".

I think the problem is the "evil hack"/workaround for opera in network\_openssl.c:

It modifies c->mem, which could have already been used for SSL\_write with an SSL\_ERROR\_WANT\_WRITE error, so we could get a new c->mem->ptr which results in the "bad write retry" error.

2 possible solutions:
 - Remove the hack
 - Delay every chunk till the next is available or connection is closed
I prefer the first - Opera users just have to update their browsers. (Bug in <= 9.01 / 8.54)

It would be nice, if someone could test the patch/give information on how to reproduce the bug.

A fresh lighty 1.4.19 installation has what looks to be the same problem described above, if I'm reading correctly. Error log excerpt:

This installed from source on red hat enterprise 3 (yeah, I know). I've switched it back to run apache for now but do have a non-production server I can do further testing on if it's helpful.

I run into the same problem as bug 258 with the SSL write errors.

Finally I could track down it to the following situation. Start two
parallel downloads using SSL in two different connections. (You can also
download through x-sendfile, or php output. I used wget for easier
reproduce and with large files to have long-lasting connections.)

Now terminate one of them and the other would be closed a bit latter. It
is very annoying as this way large downloads would probably terminate
before finishing.

The log would contain something like this:
2008-03-12 09:41:42: (network\_openssl.c.130) SSL: 1 -1 error:1409F07F:SSL routines:SSL3\_WRITE\_PENDING:bad write retry
2008-03-12 09:41:42: (connections.c.614) connection closed: write failed on fd 10

The log refers to the second connection which is closed by lighty.

I started debugging the situation an it looked like the SSL error is
generated in ssl3\_write\_pending function, which happens when the
repeated SSL\_write does not have the same arguments as the previous one,
or an other ssl\_write is called in between.
I checked these, but everything seemed to be fine.

Also tried a fix from openssl, but without any success:
<http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=598>

However after careful gdb magic the back-trace showed me that the error
function was called from SSL\_shutdown and not from SSL\_write. The
SSL\_shutdown was also called from the connection\_state\_machine function
on the CON\_STATE\_ERROR state. Hmm, strange, according to the logs the
error occurred somewhere else...

The SSL\_write failed in network\_write\_chunkqueue\_openssl, I realized the
in reality the SSL\_write was OK, it only returned SSL\_ERROR\_WANT\_WRITE,
but the SSL error queue contained an other error from an earlier SSL\_\*
call, in our case from SSL\_shutdown.

In connection\_state\_machine:

1663 case CON\_STATE\_ERROR: /\* transient **/
1664
1665 /** even if the connection was drop we still have to write it to the access log **/
1666 if (con->http\_status) {
1667 plugins\_call\_handle\_request\_done(srv, con);
1668 }
1669 #ifdef USE\_OPENSSL
1670 if (srv\_sock->is\_ssl) {
1671 int ret;
1672 switch ((ret = SSL\_shutdown(con->ssl))) {
1673 case 1:
1674 /** ok \*/
1675 break;
1676 case 0:
1677 SSL\_shutdown(con->ssl);
1678 break;
1679 default:
1680 log\_error\_write(srv, FILE\_, LINE\_, "sds", "SSL:",
1681 SSL\_get\_error(con->ssl, ret),
1682 ERR\_error\_string(ERR\_get\_error(), NULL));
1683 return -1;
1684 }
1685 }
1686 #endif

On line 1677 SSL\_shutdown is called again, because the connection is in
non-blocking mode where the first SSL\_shutdown can require an other
call. The problem that the return value of SSL\_shutdown is not checked
and in case of error the error queue is not cleared.

When the SSL\_write in network\_write\_chunkqueue\_openssl returned a simple
WANT\_WRITE error it got the error code from the previous SSL\_shutdown
call.

To fix the problem simply we need to check the return value of
SSL\_shutdown in 1677 and call ERR\_get\_error() to remove the error code
from the queue.

An other possible place is in connections.c:1557, but there is no
SSL\_shutdown just a FIXME to put it there sometimes when fdevent show
that connection is writeable. (This part is a more frequently run one,
so would have caused more trouble...)

Here is a patch for 1.4.19 r2135, but would be obvious to port to 1.5
series:

Index: connections.c
===================================================================
--- connections.c (revision 2135)
++ connections.c (working copy)
`@ -1674,7 +1674,15` @
 /\* ok **/
 break;
 case 0:
- SSL\_shutdown(con->ssl);** /
+ \* We need to get the error after SSH\_shutdown, otherwise it remains
+ \* on the error queue and causes latter false-alerts. Usually around
+ \* SSL\_write methods in network\_openssl.c which results to shutdown
+ \* of connections.
+ \*/
+ if (SSL\_shutdown(con->ssl) <= 0) {
+ ERR\_get\_error();
+ }
 break;
 default:
 log\_error\_write(srv, FILE\_, LINE\_, "sds", "SSL:",

At least now I learned a lot about lightty and openssl internals. :)

cheers,

Marton

PS: According to google it looks like CUPS has also similar problems...

Good catch!

Fixed in r2136.

I just added some ERR\_clear\_error() before ssl\_write and sll\_read to make really sure no old errors are hanging in the queue.

Excellent news!

It's early since 1.4.19, but if this tests out well, might I suggest that the importance of the fix justifies another release?

Thanks for your good work.

This is actually a DoS problem, I requested a CVE for it.

The fix does not properly work for me. Lighty no longer drops SSL connections, but it tries to properly close the broken connection, leading to *lots of* SSL error messages and very high CPU consumption.
I'll try to post an updated patch in a minute.

I attached a patch, which works without problems for me now (no drop of foreign SSL connections, no endless loop, no countless SSL errors).

I'm not completely sure whether it is correct regarding to logging -- according to the man page of SSL\_Shutdown a bidirectional SSL shutdown (that's what this is all about) is optional. With my patch applied, no logging takes place if the second part of the shutdown fails (the "ok, i'll shutdown" from the client). IMO that's fine, but as I said, I'm not sure and it is not me who has to decide.

Function-wise, the patch should be correct, but further testing is certainly appreciated.

Ok, summary for now:
 CVE-2008-1531 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-1531>)
 - lighttpd-1.4.x: Fixed in r2136, r2139, r2141, r2142 (the first two are the real fixes, the other two change the NEWS file to contain the CVE)
 - lighttpd-1.5.x: Fixed in r2140

The problem was: if a user killed his ssl connection, lighttpd would kill another ssl connection as it didn't clear the ssl error queue.

Hi,

We're still experiencing this bug:

```

% uname -r

* **Description** updated ([diff](/journals/7690/diff?detail_id=5951 "View differences"))
* **Missing in 1.5.x** set to *No*

simoncpu: this bug reports lists tons of error descriptions, some valid, some invalid, and is quite old and closed.

You really have to be more specific, and i even recommend opening a new ticket to avoid more confusion.
Also please try the latest 1.4.x svn (or the 1.4.30rc2 snapshot in <http://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/snapshots-1.4.x/>).
