# Python: Multiple integer overflows ‚Äî GLSA **200807-01**

Multiple integer overflows may allow for Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/python** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.4-r13** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.3.6-r6**>= **2.4.4-r13** |

### Background

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Python:

* David
  Remahl reported multiple integer overflows in the file imageop.c,
  leading to a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2008-1679). This issue is
  due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-4965.
* Justin Ferguson
  discovered that an integer signedness error in the zlib extension
  module might trigger insufficient memory allocation and a buffer
  overflow via a negative signed integer (CVE-2008-1721).
* Justin
  Ferguson discovered that insufficient input validation in the
  PyString\_FromStringAndSize() function might lead to a buffer overflow
  (CVE-2008-1887).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a Denial
of Service or possibly the remote execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Python.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

The imageop module is no longer built in the unaffected versions.

All Python 2.3 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.3.6-r6"
```

All Python 2.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.4.4-r13"
```

Package        : python2.5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1679 CVE-2008-1721 CVE-2008-1887

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Python language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2007-2052

    Piotr Engelking discovered that the strxfrm() function of the locale
    module miscalculates the length of an internal buffer, which may
    result in a minor information disclosure.

CVE-2007-4965

    It was discovered that several integer overflows in the imageop
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, if a user is
    tricked into processing malformed images. This issue is also
    tracked as CVE-2008-1679 due to an initially incomplete patch.

CVE-2008-1721

    Justin Ferguson discovered that a buffer overflow in the zlib
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1887

    Justin Ferguson discovered that insufficient input validation in
    PyString_FromStringAndSize() may lead to the execution of arbitrary
    code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5-5+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.2-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.5 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| ``` As reported at <http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2007-September/065826.html> . There is an integer overflow in imageop module which results in an interpreter crash. Original proof of concept code is attached. ``` | | | |

| ``` It's unclear if this only causes a crash or if it can inject data.  Referenced mailing list post points out where one error is. ``` | | | |

| ``` Cartman, please refrain from using vulgarities in your sample code. It's hard to take a bug report seriously with such variable names. ``` | | | |

| ``` Guido: That code came from the full-disclosure list posting, I think cartman was just passing it on. ``` | | | |
| [msg56047](#msg56047) - [(view)](msg56047) | Author: James Antill (nevyn) | Date: 2007-09-19 21:03 |
| ``` So I think this is all the places integer overflow checking is needed in imageop.c and rbgimgmodule.c.  There might be checks here which can't be exploited anyway, and I haven't checked any other files yet.   Feel free to comment.   Ps. This is against the 2.5 in Fedora-7, but it should apply to upstream. ``` | | | |
| [msg56049](#msg56049) - [(view)](msg56049) | Author: Ismail Donmez (donmez) \* | Date: 2007-09-19 21:38 |

| [msg56051](#msg56051) - [(view)](msg56051) | Author: Ismail Donmez (donmez) \* | Date: 2007-09-19 22:24 |
| ``` nevyn: Your patch cleanly applies to python 2.4.4 and fixes the interpreter crash with poc.py  Thanks. ``` | | | |
| [msg56052](#msg56052) - [(view)](msg56052) | Author: Guido van Rossum (gvanrossum) \* (Python committer) | Date: 2007-09-19 22:56 |
| ``` Hm. First of all, it seems the imageop module has completely missed the Py_ssize_t changes.  Second, I don't think that "if ( x != len / y )" is a valid replacement for "if ( x*y != len )" -- consider x==5, y==2, len==11. ``` | | | |
| [msg56053](#msg56053) - [(view)](msg56053) | Author: James Antill (nevyn) | Date: 2007-09-20 01:30 |
| ``` Guido: It's true that that len can be slightly bigger than x*y, the big thing is that it can't be smaller so we can malloc(len) and use upto x*y (which was my main focus).  I first looked at any of this code today, but I didn't see any reason that having len be slightly larger would be a problem ... and in pretty much all cases it'll be len == x*y.   However we could have both cases covered by doing:   if ( (len != x*y) || (x != (len / y)) )  ...but esp. at that point it seems like we'd want some interface so that we could just do something like:   if ( check_mutliplies2(len, x, y) ) ``` | | | |

| ``` Neal, didn't you say you had a fix for this? ``` | | | |
| [msg56659](#msg56659) - [(view)](msg56659) | Author: James Antill (nevyn) | Date: 2007-10-22 21:43 |
| ``` Not sure who Neal is, and this probably isn't a final upstream fix ... but it's what I've applied to Fedora's python. It's basically the same patch as before, but it keeps the original * tests instead of just replacing them with / tests. So given:   if x * y != len  ...the first patch did:   if len / x != y  ...and this patch does:   if x * y != len ||     len / x != y ``` | | | |
| [msg58789](#msg58789) - [(view)](msg58789) | Author: Jim Panetta (jhpanetta) | Date: 2007-12-19 02:54 |
| ``` Is this final yet?  Our system security group is a little paranoid about buffer overflows of any sort and are starting to make noises.  I can confirm that the Oct 20 patch applies against Python 2.5.1 on RHEL4, and that the string length error is generated when running poc.py. ``` | | | |

| [msg58828](#msg58828) - [(view)](msg58828) | Author: James Antill (nevyn) | Date: 2007-12-19 20:43 |
| ``` I've applied the last patch I posted to recent RHEL and Fedora releases, and it doesn't seem to break anything ... and from what I could see it fixed the problem. ``` | | | |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

It was discovered that there were new integer overflows in the imageop

module. If an attacker were able to trick a Python application into

processing a specially crafted image, they could execute arbitrary code

with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1679](/security/CVE-2008-1679))

Justin Ferguson discovered that the zlib module did not correctly

handle certain archives. If an attacker were able to trick a Python

application into processing a specially crafted archive file, they could

execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1721](/security/CVE-2008-1721))

Justin Ferguson discovered that certain string manipulations in Python

could be made to overflow. If an attacker were able to pass a specially

crafted string through the PyString\_FromStringAndSize function, they

could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1887](/security/CVE-2008-1887))

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Python's core and modules

including hashlib, binascii, pickle, md5, stringobject, unicodeobject,

bufferobject, longobject, tupleobject, stropmodule, gcmodule, and

mmapmodule. If an attacker were able to exploit these flaws they could

execute arbitrary code with user privileges or cause Python applications

to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-2315](/security/CVE-2008-2315), [CVE-2008-2316](/security/CVE-2008-2316),

[CVE-2008-3142](/security/CVE-2008-3142), [CVE-2008-3143](/security/CVE-2008-3143), [CVE-2008-3144](/security/CVE-2008-3144)).

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- powerdns spoofing problems
The PowerDNS packages were updated to offer better spoofing
resistance by not ignoring invalid queries. (CVE-2008-3337)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- dnsmasq spoofing problems
The DNS server dnsmasq was changed to use random UDP source ports
and a random TRXID now. (CVE-2008-1447)
This problem only affected openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- python multiple problems
The scripting language python was updated to fix several security
vulnerabilities. (CVE-2008-1679,CVE-2008-1887, CVE-2008-3143,
CVE-2008-3142, CVE-2008-3144, CVE-2008-2315, CVE-2008-2316)
All SUSE Linux products received updated python packages.
- mailman cross site scripting
The mailing list manager mailman was updated to fix a
cross-site-scripting bug (CVE-2008-0564) and a mistake in
translation.
All distributions containing mailman received updated packages.
- ruby multiple problems
The scripting language ruby was updated to fix:
- a possible information leakage (CVE-2008-1145)
- a directory traversal bug (CVE-2008-1891) in WEBrick
- various memory corruptions and integer overflows in array and
string handling (CVE-2008-2662, CVE-2008-2663, CVE-2008-2664,
CVE-2008-2725, CVE-2008-2726, CVE-2008-2727, CVE-2008-2728)
ruby was updated on all SUSE Linux products.
- Opera 9.52
Opera was upgraded to version 9.52 to fix possible security
vulnerabilities.
Please see <http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/952/> for
more details.
- neon NULL pointer problem
The helper library neon was updated to fix a NULL pointer dereference
in the digest authentication code. (CVE-2008-3746)
neon was updated on all affected distributions.
- rxvt-unicode session hijacking
Using rxvt-unicode it was possible to open a terminal on :0 when
the environment variable was not set.
This could be exploited by local users to hijack X11 connections (CVE-2008-1142).
rxvt-unicode was updated on openSUSE 10.2-11.0.
- perl multiple problems
Several problems were fixed in the scripting language perl.
Specially crafted regular expressions could crash perl
(CVE-2008-1927).
Insufficient symlink checks in the File::Path could result in wrong
file permissions (CVE-2008-2827).
Additionally problem in the CGI module was fixed that could result
in an endless loop if uploads were canceled.
- Wireshark / ethereal multiple security problems
Various vulnerabilities have been fixed in ethereal and wireshark:
CVE-2008-3137, CVE-2008-3138, CVE-2008-3139,
CVE-2008-3140, CVE-2008-3141, CVE-2008-3145
and CVE-2008-3146. Those could be potentially used to crash
wireshark or potentially execute code.
Updates have been released for all SUSE Linux distributions.
- namazu cross site scripting
The indexing engine namazu was upgraded to fix a UTF-7
cross-site-scripting vulnerability. (CVE-2008-1468)
namazu was updated on all products containing it.
- gnome-screensaver clipboard disclosure
gnome-screensaver was updated to disallows local users to
read the contents of the clipboard for a locked screen using
ctrl-v. (CVE-2007-6389)
Updates have been released for openSUSE 10.3, other distributions
were not affected.
- MySQL security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix a security problem:
CVE-2008-2079: MySQL allowed local users to bypass certain privilege
checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1)
DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within
the MySQL home data directory, which can point to tables that are
created in the future.
CVE-2006-7232: sql\_select.cc in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.32 and 5.1.x
before 5.1.14 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA
table, as originally demonstrated using ORDER BY.
MySQL was updated on all SUSE Linux distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Package        : python2.4
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1679 CVE-2008-1721 CVE-2008-1887

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Python language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2007-2052

    Piotr Engelking discovered that the strxfrm() function of the locale
    module miscalculates the length of an internal buffer, which may
    result in a minor information disclosure.

CVE-2007-4965

    It was discovered that several integer overflows in the imageop
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, if a user is
    tricked into processing malformed images. This issue is also
    tracked as CVE-2008-1679 due to an initially incomplete patch.

CVE-2008-1721

    Justin Ferguson discovered that a buffer overflow in the zlib
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1887

    Justin Ferguson discovered that insufficient input validation in
    PyString_FromStringAndSize() may lead to the execution of arbitrary
    code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.4-3+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.5-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.4 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

## 2. Avaya System Products using Solaris 10 and Python:

Some Avaya system products are
delivered with an Operating System
from Sun Microsystems. Actions to be
taken on these products are described
below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CMS | R15, R16 | Low | Install patch 143506-01. |
| Avaya IR | 3.0, 4.0 | Low | Python is installed on IR by default, but is not enabled, configured, or supported. The Sun patch will not be tested for use on IR. If Python is used on IR, Avaya recommends using Sun's suggested workaround. |

**Recommended Actions:**

Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
