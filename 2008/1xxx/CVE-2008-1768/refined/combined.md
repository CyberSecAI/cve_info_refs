# Security Advisory 0803

```

Summary           : Buffer overflows in multiple modules
Date              : 13 April 2008
Affected versions : VLC media player 0.8.6e and earlier
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-0803
CVE reference     : CVE-2008-0073, CVE-2008-1489, CVE-2008-1768, CVE-2008-1769

```
## Details

VLC media player's following modules suffer from arbitrary memory overwrite vulnerabilities when using specially crafted (invalid) input streams / files:
Real RTSP and Real media demuxers, MP4 demuxer, Cinepak decoder.

## Impact

If successful, a malicious third party could trigger the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the running instance or terminate the application unexpectedly.

## Threat mitigation

Exploitation of the MP4 / Real Media demuxer or the Cinepak decoder issues requires the user to explicitly open specially crafted files or streams.

Exploitation of the Real RTSP problems requires the user to explicitly open streams provided by malicious third parties.

## Workarounds

The user is asked to open Real RTSP / Real Media streams and MP4 files as well as files containing Cinepak video streams from trusted content providers only. In case of uncertainess, it is recommended not to open this kind of streams or files. RTSP streams can easily be identified by the `rtsp` prefix of their URL/MRL, while the MP4 container file type is recognizable by the `mp4` suffix. Cinepak encoded video streams are usually found in MOV and MP4 container files only, which may be perceived by their `mp4` and `mov` suffixes. Real Media files usually include `ram`, `ra` or `rm` suffixes.

## Solution

VLC media player 0.8.6f addresses these issues and introduces further
usability fixes.

Pre-compiled packages are available at the usual download locations.

## Credits

The Real RTSP demuxer, Real media demuxer, MP4 demuxer and Cinepak codec vulnerabilities were discovered by Drew Yao of Apple Product Security.

# VLC: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200804-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC, allowing for the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/vlc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.6f** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.6f** |

### Background

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC:

* Luigi Auriemma discovered that the stack-based buffer overflow when
  reading subtitles, which has been reported as CVE-2007-6681 in GLSA
  200803-13, was not properly fixed (CVE-2008-1881).
* Alin Rad Pop of Secunia reported an array indexing vulnerability in the
  sdpplin\_parse() function when processing streams from RTSP servers in
  Xine code, which is also used in VLC (CVE-2008-0073).
* Drew Yao and Nico Golde reported an integer overflow in the
  MP4\_ReadBox\_rdrf() function in the file libmp4.c leading to a
  heap-based buffer overflow when reading MP4 files (CVE-2008-1489).
* Drew Yao also reported integer overflows in the MP4 demuxer,
  the Real demuxer and in the Cinepak codec, which might lead to buffer
  overflows (CVE-2008-1768).
* Drew Yao finally discovered and a
  boundary error in Cinepak, which might lead to memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-1769).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted media
file or stream, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary
code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.8.6f"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security Advisory 0803

```

Summary           : Buffer overflows in multiple modules
Date              : 13 April 2008
Affected versions : VLC media player 0.8.6e and earlier
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-0803
CVE reference     : CVE-2008-0073, CVE-2008-1489, CVE-2008-1768, CVE-2008-1769

```
## Details

VLC media player's following modules suffer from arbitrary memory overwrite vulnerabilities when using specially crafted (invalid) input streams / files:
Real RTSP and Real media demuxers, MP4 demuxer, Cinepak decoder.

## Impact

If successful, a malicious third party could trigger the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the running instance or terminate the application unexpectedly.

## Threat mitigation

Exploitation of the MP4 / Real Media demuxer or the Cinepak decoder issues requires the user to explicitly open specially crafted files or streams.

Exploitation of the Real RTSP problems requires the user to explicitly open streams provided by malicious third parties.

## Workarounds

The user is asked to open Real RTSP / Real Media streams and MP4 files as well as files containing Cinepak video streams from trusted content providers only. In case of uncertainess, it is recommended not to open this kind of streams or files. RTSP streams can easily be identified by the `rtsp` prefix of their URL/MRL, while the MP4 container file type is recognizable by the `mp4` suffix. Cinepak encoded video streams are usually found in MOV and MP4 container files only, which may be perceived by their `mp4` and `mov` suffixes. Real Media files usually include `ram`, `ra` or `rm` suffixes.

## Solution

VLC media player 0.8.6f addresses these issues and introduces further
usability fixes.

Pre-compiled packages are available at the usual download locations.

## Credits

The Real RTSP demuxer, Real media demuxer, MP4 demuxer and Cinepak codec vulnerabilities were discovered by Drew Yao of Apple Product Security.
