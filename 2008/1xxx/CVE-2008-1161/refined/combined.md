## Details

Alin Rad Pop discovered an array index vulnerability in the SDP

parser. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

malicious RTSP stream, a remote attacker may be able to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2008-0073](/security/CVE-2008-0073))

Luigi Auriemma discovered that xine-lib did not properly check

buffer sizes in the RTSP header-handling code. If xine-lib opened an

RTSP stream with crafted SDP attributes, a remote attacker may be

able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-0225](/security/CVE-2008-0225), [CVE-2008-0238](/security/CVE-2008-0238))

Damian Frizza and Alfredo Ortega discovered that xine-lib did not

properly validate FLAC tags. If a user or automated system were

tricked into opening a crafted FLAC file, a remote attacker may be

able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-0486](/security/CVE-2008-0486))

It was discovered that the ASF demuxer in xine-lib did not properly

check the length if the ASF header. If a user or automated system

were tricked into opening a crafted ASF file, a remote attacker

could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1110](/security/CVE-2008-1110))

It was discovered that the Matroska demuxer in xine-lib did not

properly verify frame sizes. If xine-lib opened a crafted ASF file,

a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2008-1161](/security/CVE-2008-1161))

Luigi Auriemma discovered multiple integer overflows in xine-lib. If

a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted FLV,

MOV, RM, MVE, MKV or CAK file, a remote attacker may be able to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2008-1482](/security/CVE-2008-1482))

It was discovered that xine-lib did not properly validate its input

when processing Speex file headers. If a user or automated system

were tricked into opening a specially crafted Speex file, an

attacker could create a denial of service or possibly execute

arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1686](/security/CVE-2008-1686))

Guido Landi discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in xine-lib

when processing NSF files. If xine-lib opened a specially crafted

NSF file with a long NSF title, an attacker could create a denial of

service or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2008-1878](/security/CVE-2008-1878))

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- sarg buffer overflow
The SQUID logfile analyzer sarg was updated to fix a buffer overflow
that can occur while handling untrusted log data. (CVE-2008-1167)
sarg was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- phpMyAdmin multiple XSS problems
phpMyAdmin was updated to fix multiple cross-site-scripting
vulnerabilities (CVE-2007-6100, CVE-2007-5589).
phpMyAdmin was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- xine FLAC security issues
The multimedia framework xine was updated to fix a possible buffer
overflow that can be triggered via FLAC tags to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2008-0486) and a possible buffer overflow in the matroska
demuxer (CVE-2008-1161).
All Xine versions on our products have been updated.
- bind 1 byte overflow
Certain input data could trigger a buffer overflow in the
'inet\_network' function of libbind.
Applications that use this function could therefore potentially be
crashed or exploited to execute arbitrary code.
The Bind server itself is not affected (CVE-2008-0122).
- dbus-1 policy application problem
The message bus dbus-1 was updated to fix a vulnerability caused by
applying the policies incorrectly. (CVE-2008-0595)
dbus-1 was updated on all distributions.
- silc-toolkit buffer overflow
silc-toolkit was updated to fix a stack-based buffer overflow in
the silc\_fingerprint() function which can possibly be exploited to
execute arbitrary code remotely. (CVE-2008-1227)
silc-toolkit is included only in openSUSE 10.3 and was fixed there.
- boost regular expression problems
Certain regular expressions could cause the boost library to crash
(CVE-2008-0171, CVE-2008-0172).
boost was updated for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux 10.1,
and openSUSE 10.2, 10.3. Older products are not affected.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Package        : xine-lib
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-1246 CVE-2007-1387 CVE-2008-0073 CVE-2008-0486
                 CVE-2008-1161
Debian Bug     : 464696

Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xine, a
media player library, allowed for a denial of service or arbitrary code
execution, which could be exploited through viewing malicious content.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2007-1246 / CVE-2007-1387

    The DMO_VideoDecoder_Open function does not set the biSize before use in a
    memcpy, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a buffer overflow
    and possibly execute arbitrary code (applies to sarge only).

CVE-2008-0073

    Array index error in the sdpplin_parse function allows remote RTSP servers
    to execute arbitrary code via a large streamid SDP parameter.

CVE-2008-0486

    Array index vulnerability in libmpdemux/demux_audio.c might allow remote
    attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted FLAC tag, which triggers
    a buffer overflow (applies to etch only).

CVE-2008-1161

    Buffer overflow in the Matroska demuxer allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a Matroska
    file with invalid frame sizes.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
1.1.2+dfsg-6.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1sarge7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.11-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xine-lib package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
