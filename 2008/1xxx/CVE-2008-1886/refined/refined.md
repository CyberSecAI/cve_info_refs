Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `NeffyLauncher.dll` ActiveX control has two vulnerabilities:
1. **Arbitrary File Copy:** The ActiveX control allows an attacker to copy a malicious file to any path on the user's system via the `HttpSkin` and `SkinPath` parameters.
2. **Keycode Bypass:** An attacker can generate a valid keycode by reverse-engineering the ActiveX control. This keycode is used to restrict the execution of the ActiveX control to specific domains.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **Path Traversal:** The `SkinPath` parameter allows for path traversal using `../../` sequences, enabling the attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem.
2. **Lack of Input Validation:** The ActiveX control does not properly validate the `HttpSkin` and `SkinPath` parameters, which leads to arbitrary file copy.
3. **Insecure Keycode Generation:** The keycode mechanism can be bypassed by reverse engineering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can use the vulnerability to copy a malicious executable file to a startup directory, such as "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup", leading to code execution when the user restarts their computer.
- **Bypass Domain Restrictions:** An attacker can generate valid keycodes to bypass the domain restrictions of the ActiveX control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must have write access to a board on a website that uses this ActiveX control or obtain a valid keycode for the target website
- The attacker needs to host a malicious ZIP archive containing the payload on a web server they control.
- The attacker needs to craft a webpage that contains the vulnerable ActiveX control with modified `HttpSkin` and `SkinPath` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to write to a web forum or website that is utilizing the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- Alternatively, the attacker needs the capability to reverse engineer the ActiveX control and generate the keycode to bypass the security mechanism of the control.
- The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious ZIP archive and have knowledge of how to set `HttpSkin` and `SkinPath`.

The provided information gives more details than the official CVE description regarding the specific parameters (`HttpSkin`, `SkinPath`), the arbitrary file copy method, and the method of generating key codes.
