### Vulnerability Summary:
The web interface on the Linksys WRT54G router with firmware 1.00.9 does not require authentication when invoking scripts.

### Root Cause:
The scripts that process configuration changes do not require authentication.

### Weakness:
Missing authentication for sensitive administrative functions.

### Impact:
Remote attackers can perform arbitrary administrative actions.

### Attack Vectors:
Direct requests to specific `.tri` scripts (e.g., `Advanced.tri`, `AdvRoute.tri`, `Basic.tri`, etc.)

### Required Attacker Capabilities:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface, typically requiring network access to the router (either within the LAN or, if remote management is enabled, from the WAN). The attacker also needs to know or guess the correct parameters for the desired configuration change.

### Exploitation Details and Examples:
*   **Changing DNS Settings:** An attacker can poison the DNS settings by sending a POST request to `Basic.tri` with modified DNS server values.
*   **Restoring Factory Defaults:** An attacker can reset the router to factory defaults by sending a POST request to `factdefa.tri`.
*   **Resetting the Administrative Password:** An attacker can change the administrative password by sending a POST request to `manage.tri`.
*   **Enabling Mixed Wireless Network Mode:** An attacker can configure the wireless settings by sending a POST request to `WBasic.tri`.
*   **Disabling Wireless Encryption:** An attacker can disable wireless encryption by sending a POST request to `Security.tri`.
*   **Enabling DMZ:** An attacker can enable DMZ by sending a POST request to `dmz.tri`.
*   **Enabling Remote Management:** An attacker can enable remote management by sending a POST request to `manage.tri`.

### Mitigations:
*   **Change Default LAN IP:** The exploit relies on the default LAN IP address (192.168.1.1). Changing this makes the described attacks more difficult.
*   **Upgrade Firmware:** Upgrade to a firmware version that addresses this vulnerability.
*   **Disable Remote Management:** If remote management is not required, disable it.
