Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1875

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The PHP Photo Gallery 1.0 application uses insecure MySQL queries, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Insecure MySQL queries:** The application does not properly sanitize user inputs before using them in database queries. Specifically, the `photo_id` parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Admin Access:** In particular, the provided exploit demonstrates how an attacker can retrieve the administrator's username and password in plaintext. This allows full access to the application.

**Attack Vector:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable through an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `photo_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker should understand basic SQL injection techniques to manipulate the vulnerable parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit demonstrates a specific SQL injection technique using `UNION ALL SELECT` to extract data from the `users` table.
*   The application stores passwords in plaintext, exacerbating the severity of the vulnerability.
*   The provided exploit works by injecting SQL code into the `photo_id` parameter. The code uses `UNION ALL SELECT` to append the username and password from the users table to the query results.
*   The exploit directly retrieves admin credentials and displays them in the output, highlighting the significant risk this vulnerability poses.
