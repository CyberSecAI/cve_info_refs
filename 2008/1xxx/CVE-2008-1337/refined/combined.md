How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Application: Timbuktu Pro Remote Control Software
http://www.netopia.com/software/products/tb2/
Versions: <= 8.6.5 [RC 229]
Platforms: Windows
Mac OS X has not been tested
Bugs: A] Denial of Service

1) Introduction
===============
Timbuktu is a software for controlling the computer remotely.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
--------------------
A] Denial of Service
--------------------
The instructions which handle the incoming instant messages are
vulnerable to a couple of Denial of Service attacks.
The first one consists in the possibility of crashing the program
through an invalid Version field while the other type of bug is the
freezing and the subsequent termination of Timbuktu using an invalid or
incomplete message.
-------------------------------------
B] limited upload directory traversal
-------------------------------------
Each message or attachment is considered by Timbuktu as a file which is
stored in temporary folders in the program's directory.
Although the program uses various ways to avoid possible directory
traversal attacks is still possible for an attacker to upload files
with any filename in any location of the disk on which Timbuktu is
running.
The only limitation in this vulnerability is that Timbuktu changes the
name of the file if one with the same name already exists so for
example if we specify notepad.exe but it already exists, the program
will create the file notepad2.exe.
currently I have found no ways to bypass this limitation.

1) Introduction
===============
Timbuktu is a software for controlling the computer remotely.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
--------------------
A] Denial of Service
--------------------
The instructions which handle the incoming instant messages are
vulnerable to a couple of Denial of Service attacks.
The first one consists in the possibility of crashing the program
through an invalid Version field while the other type of bug is the
freezing and the subsequent termination of Timbuktu using an invalid or
incomplete message.
-------------------------------------
B] limited upload directory traversal
-------------------------------------
Each message or attachment is considered by Timbuktu as a file which is
stored in temporary folders in the program's directory.
Although the program uses various ways to avoid possible directory
traversal attacks is still possible for an attacker to upload files
with any filename in any location of the disk on which Timbuktu is
running.
The only limitation in this vulnerability is that Timbuktu changes the
name of the file if one with the same name already exists so for
example if we specify notepad.exe but it already exists, the program
will create the file notepad2.exe.
Currently I have found no ways to bypass this limitation.
