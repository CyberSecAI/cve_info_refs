Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1408

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the `banner_out()` function within `includes/functions/banners-external.php` of phpBP.
*   The function incorrectly uses `$_GET['id']` directly in an SQL query without proper sanitization, while attempting to validate `$_POST['id']`, which is not used. This is a simple oversight by the developer, filtering the wrong variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection.  The `$_GET['id']` parameter, intended to identify a banner, is directly concatenated into the SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Extraction:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database. The provided exploit demonstrates how to extract the username and password hash from the `phpbp_users` table.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly shown, SQL injection can potentially be leveraged further to execute arbitrary code on the server if the database user has sufficient permissions.
*   **Redirect Manipulation:** The vulnerability is in the context of a redirect to a banner URL, so it allows an attacker to redirect the user anywhere.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious `id` parameter in an HTTP GET request to `index.php` with `function=banner_out`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable phpBP instance.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `function` parameter (`banner_out`) and the `id` parameter.
*   **Basic SQL Injection Skills:** Basic knowledge of SQL is needed to craft the malicious injection.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Snippet (from exploit-db):**
    ```php
    3   function banner_out() //zlicza ilosc klikniec na banner
    4   {
    5    global $conf;
    6
    7    if($_GET['id'])
    8    {
    9     SQLvalidate($_POST['id']);
    10
    11    $db = new dbquery;
    12    $db->query("SELECT * FROM $conf[prefix]banners WHERE id=$_GET[id]") or $db->err(__FILE__, __LINE__);
    13
    14    if($db->num_rows()==0)
    15    {
    16     redirect('index.php?module=error?error=banners_error2');
    17     exit;
    18    }
    19
    20    $d=$db->fetch_object();
    21    $db->query("UPDATE $conf[prefix]banners SET views=views+1 WHERE id='$_GET[id]'") or $db->err(__FILE__, __LINE__);
    22
    23    redirect($d->url);
    24   }
    25
    26   exit;
    27  }
    ```
*   **Exploit Example:**
    ```
    http://[host]/[path]/index.php?function=banner_out&id=10000/**/LIMIT/**/0/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/1,2,concat(0x687474703A2F2F,login,0x5F,pass),4,5,6,7,8,9/**/FROM/**/phpbp_users/**/LIMIT/**/1/*
    ```

**Additional Information:**
*   The provided exploit in exploit-db demonstrates how to extract the username and MD5-hashed password of a user, redirecting to a URL that includes this information.
*   The vulnerability affects phpBP versions up to and including RC3 (2.204) FIX4.
*   The author of the exploit, irk4z, mentioned that a patch was released quickly by the phpBP support team.

The information from exploit-db provides a good understanding of the vulnerability with a functional exploit example, while irk4z's blog confirms the details and that a patch was provided.
