{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in three setuid-root binaries (pbksh, pbsh, pbrun) of Symark PowerBroker.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The programs use strcat() to append the command-line argument argv[0] to a statically-sized 1048-byte stack buffer without proper bounds checking.",
      "The affected binaries are setuid-root, which allows an attacker to escalate privileges."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain control of execution, escalate to root privileges, and potentially compromise the entire corporate network by exploiting this vulnerability, including the master server.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation by supplying a specially crafted value for argv[0] when invoking one of the vulnerable setuid-root binaries (pbksh, pbsh, or pbrun)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to a system running a vulnerable version of PowerBroker (up to and including 5.0.1). No prior privileges are required other than the ability to execute the vulnerable binaries."
