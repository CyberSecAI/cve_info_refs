NNL-Labs & MNIN | Symark PowerBroker Security Advisory

February 26, 2008

Summary

Symark  is  a  Software  500  company  and  the  producer  of  Symark  PowerBroker,  a  Unix/Linux
privilege management solution designed primarily for flexible and centralized access control to
the root accounts within a corporate architecture.  A stack-based buffer overflow exists in three
of the setuid-root binaries (pbksh, pbsh, pbrun) provided with PowerBroker, which allows for any
user with local access to escalate to the root level.

Given  the  nature  of  the  PowerBroker  environment,  these  vulnerabilities  can  rapidly  lead  to
accentuated  circumstances  and  the  compromise  of  root  accounts  on  all  Unix/Linux  systems
(including  the  master),  in  a  corporate  network,  provided  the  systems  are  also  running
PowerBroker  (they  should  be,  that’s  the  point)  by  using  the  same  three  PowerBroker  utilities  or
specially-crafted attack tools.

Affected Versions

These  vulnerabilities  apply  to  PowerBroker  up  to  and  including  5.0.1.  Symark  has  released  a
service pack for 2.8, 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, 4.0, and 5.0/5.0.1. For more information, including how to install
the  service  packs  and  how  to  determine  if  an  environment  has  been  affected,  please  consult
the vendor security update: www.symark.com/support/PBFeb2008Announcement.html.

Details

When  PowerBroker  clients  (pbksh,  pbsh,  pbrun)  initiate  a  command  request  to  the  master,  a
protocol/version  announcement  is  exchanged  between the  two  systems  over  the  network.  An
example  of  this  announcement  is  shown  below,  with  the  name  highlighted  to  indicate  that  it
differs between programs, depending on if pbksh, pbsh, or pbrun is used.

#!Proto pbksh version=4.0.8-03,MPX,MPX2,LOGSRV,[…]

The  name  is  not  hard-coded  in  each  respective  program,  rather  it  is  taken  from  the  argv[0]
command-line  argument  at  runtime.  It  is  appended,  via  strcat(),  to  the  announcement  string,
which is stored in a statically-sized 1048-byte stack buffer. By supplying a specially-crafted value
for argv[0] when invoking one of the three setuid-root binaries, an attacker can gain control of
execution when the function containing the stack buffer returns.

Exploit Design

The three PowerBroker binaries are setuid-root because they need to create a TCP-socket with
the  master  using  a  reserved  client/source  port  (see  allownonreservedconnections  setting).  The
process’ user id (uid) is switched to that of the calling user after creation of the socket, which is
before the buffer overflows.  However the effective user id (euid) is allowed to remain the same.
Since  the  program  is  setuid,  it  is  possible  to  leverage  the  root  euid  to  restore  a  root  uid,  thus
allowing an attacker to then gain a privileged shell.

The output below shows the parameters to setrestuid (in the middle), along with the before (left)
and after (right) status of the process privileges.

[mike@fedoravm ~]$ ./pbexploit_32bit_x86 (cid:1)Non-privileged shell
[setresuid]     500, 0, 0       (-1, 500, -1)   500, 500, 0
[setresuid]     500, 500, 0     (-1, 0, -1)     500, 0, 0
[setresuid]     500, 0, 0       (0, 0, 0)       0, 0, 0 (cid:1)Called from attack code
[root@fedoravm ~]# (cid:1)Privileged shell

The  design  should  avoid  the  use  of  system()  when  spawning  a  shell  (due  to  issues  with  setuid),
NULL bytes due to issues with strcat(), and forward slashes due to path-related string operations.
If the desired actions cannot be completed in 1024 bytes of shellcode or less, then a searching
algorithm can be implemented to locate pre-staged code in memory.

A  greedier  design  than  the  simple  root  shell  could  include  a  payload  that  immediately  begins
compromising other hosts by leveraging the ability for PowerBroker clients to run commands on
other (remote) PowerBroker clients (see allowremotejobs default setting). By cycling through the
IP  addresses  on  the  target  subnet  from  the  attack  code,  it  would  be  possible  to  compromise
hundreds or thousands of corporate systems in a matter of seconds.

This functionality can also be used to transfer and install a rootkit on the master using the same
network  ports  as  legitimate  PowerBroker  traffic.  By  then  designing  an  “in-socket”  rootkit  for  this
purpose, it would be possible to gain control of all root accounts in the corporate architecture
by coordinating with the compromised master over the covert channel.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
