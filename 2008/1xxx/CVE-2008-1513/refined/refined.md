Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in Danneo CMS versions 0.5.1 and earlier. It occurs because the application uses user-controlled input (the HTTP Referer header) in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The attacker cannot directly see the results of the SQL queries, but they can infer information based on the time it takes for the server to respond. This is exploited by using the `BENCHMARK()` function in MySQL to introduce delays, thus confirming successful queries.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or escape the `Referer` header before using it in a SQL query, allowing the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials (specifically the admin password hash, as demonstrated by the exploit).
*   **Potential Full System Compromise:** By gaining access to the administrator password, the attacker could potentially gain full control of the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Referer Header:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `Referer` HTTP header. The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query within the `Referer` header, and the vulnerable application executes this query on the backend database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft SQL queries that can be used for blind injection. The provided exploit script automates much of this process, making it easier for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **"Referers statistics" option turned ON:** The vulnerable code path is triggered by the "Referers statistics" option being enabled in the CMS.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit script is a timing-based blind SQL injection tool, utilizing the MySQL `BENCHMARK()` function to cause delays in the server's response. This allows the attacker to determine the truthiness of SQL conditions.
*   The script automatically detects the CMS version and database table prefix based on the response, although the prefix can be manually specified.
*   The script is designed to extract the administrator's password hash.
*   The script includes a verbose mode for troubleshooting purposes.
