Package        : python2.5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1679 CVE-2008-1721 CVE-2008-1887

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Python language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2007-2052

    Piotr Engelking discovered that the strxfrm() function of the locale
    module miscalculates the length of an internal buffer, which may
    result in a minor information disclosure.

CVE-2007-4965

    It was discovered that several integer overflows in the imageop
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, if a user is
    tricked into processing malformed images. This issue is also
    tracked as CVE-2008-1679 due to an initially incomplete patch.

CVE-2008-1721

    Justin Ferguson discovered that a buffer overflow in the zlib
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1887

    Justin Ferguson discovered that insufficient input validation in
    PyString_FromStringAndSize() may lead to the execution of arbitrary
    code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5-5+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.2-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.5 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : python2.4
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1679 CVE-2008-1721 CVE-2008-1887

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Python language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2007-2052

    Piotr Engelking discovered that the strxfrm() function of the locale
    module miscalculates the length of an internal buffer, which may
    result in a minor information disclosure.

CVE-2007-4965

    It was discovered that several integer overflows in the imageop
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, if a user is
    tricked into processing malformed images. This issue is also
    tracked as CVE-2008-1679 due to an initially incomplete patch.

CVE-2008-1721

    Justin Ferguson discovered that a buffer overflow in the zlib
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1887

    Justin Ferguson discovered that insufficient input validation in
    PyString_FromStringAndSize() may lead to the execution of arbitrary
    code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.4-3+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.5-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.4 packages.

## Details

It was discovered that there were new integer overflows in the imageop

module. If an attacker were able to trick a Python application into

processing a specially crafted image, they could execute arbitrary code

with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1679](/security/CVE-2008-1679))

Justin Ferguson discovered that the zlib module did not correctly

handle certain archives. If an attacker were able to trick a Python

application into processing a specially crafted archive file, they could

execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1721](/security/CVE-2008-1721))

Justin Ferguson discovered that certain string manipulations in Python

could be made to overflow. If an attacker were able to pass a specially

crafted string through the PyString\_FromStringAndSize function, they

could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1887](/security/CVE-2008-1887))

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Python's core and modules

including hashlib, binascii, pickle, md5, stringobject, unicodeobject,

bufferobject, longobject, tupleobject, stropmodule, gcmodule, and

mmapmodule. If an attacker were able to exploit these flaws they could

execute arbitrary code with user privileges or cause Python applications

to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-2315](/security/CVE-2008-2315), [CVE-2008-2316](/security/CVE-2008-2316),

[CVE-2008-3142](/security/CVE-2008-3142), [CVE-2008-3143](/security/CVE-2008-3143), [CVE-2008-3144](/security/CVE-2008-3144)).

Title: Buffer overflow in Python zlib extension module
Date Discoverd: ??-April-2008
Date Reported: 08-April-2008
Date Patched: 08-April-2008
Date Disclosed: 09-April-2008
Criticality: Critical
Affected Products
-----------------
Python 2.5.2, earlier and unstable version are likely to be vulnerable
Synopsis
--------
The zlib extension module contains a method for flushing decompression
streams
that takes an input parameter of how much data to flush. This parameter
is a
signed integer that is not verified for sanity and is thus potentially
negative.
When passed a negative value memory is misallocated and then the signed
integer
is converted to an unsigned integer resulting in buffer overflow.
Techical Details
-----------------

Python-2.5.2/Modules/zlibmodule.c:
761 PyDoc\_STRVAR(decomp\_flush\_\_doc\_\_,
762 "flush( [length] ) -- Return a string containing any remaining\n"
763 "decompressed data. length, if given, is the initial size of the\n"
764 "output buffer.\n"
765 "\n"
766 "The decompressor object can no longer be used after this call.");
767
768 static PyObject \*
769 PyZlib\_unflush(compobject \*self, PyObject \*args)
770 {
771 int err, length = DEFAULTALLOC;
772 PyObject \* retval = NULL;
773 unsigned long start\_total\_out;
774
775 if (!PyArg\_ParseTuple(args, "|i:flush", &length))
776 return NULL;
777 if (!(retval = PyString\_FromStringAndSize(NULL, length)))
778 return NULL;
779
780
781 ENTER\_ZLIB
782
783 start\_total\_out = self->zst.total\_out;
784 self->zst.avail\_out = length;
785 self->zst.next\_out = (Byte \*)PyString\_AS\_STRING(retval);
786
787 Py\_BEGIN\_ALLOW\_THREADS
788 err = inflate(&(self->zst), Z\_FINISH);
789 Py\_END\_ALLOW\_THREADS
The PyArg\_ParseTuple() function acts as a bridge between Python and C
and
initializes the length variable if one was provided. Then at line 777
this
variable is passed as the second parameter to
PyString\_FromStringAndSize().
The second parameter to PyString\_FromStringAndSize() is also signed, and
the API call itself does not validate the parameter in non-debug builds.
This value then has the size of a PyStringObject summed with it and is
passed to the Python allocator which services the request. Upon
successfull
allocation the assignment at line 784 causes a sign conversion as the
avail\_out
member of the zst structure is an unsigned variable. Then at line 785
the
pointer to the memory that was allocated at line 777 is assigned to the
next\_out
member of the zst structure. This culminates in buffer overflow at line
788
when the zlib inflate() function decompresses data.
Reproduction / Proof-of-Concept
-------------------------------
When the length variable contains a value of -24 then the allocator is
told
to reserve 0 bytes of memory, however the allocator modifies the request
and
will allocate one byte of memory. For values ranging between -2 and -23
a small
amount of memory will be allocated due to being summed with the size of
a
PyStringObject. Both will mislead zlib into believing that there is
several
gigabytes of space available. If an attacker controls the input stream
then they can avoid the obvious Denial of Service simply be making the
available input large than the output buffer, but smaller than the
size required to hit an unmapped or read-only page of memory.
A semi-interesting note is that the value -1 will not work as when
extracting
this integer an API call mixes the return value and error code, with -1
indicating that an error occurred. This check is done in conjunction
with
another check and thus does not cause the routine to fail, but rather
causes
PyArg\_ParseTuple() to initialize the length variable with a value of 1.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Python: Multiple integer overflows — GLSA **200807-01**

Multiple integer overflows may allow for Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/python** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.4-r13** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.3.6-r6**>= **2.4.4-r13** |

### Background

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Python:

* David
  Remahl reported multiple integer overflows in the file imageop.c,
  leading to a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2008-1679). This issue is
  due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-4965.
* Justin Ferguson
  discovered that an integer signedness error in the zlib extension
  module might trigger insufficient memory allocation and a buffer
  overflow via a negative signed integer (CVE-2008-1721).
* Justin
  Ferguson discovered that insufficient input validation in the
  PyString\_FromStringAndSize() function might lead to a buffer overflow
  (CVE-2008-1887).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a Denial
of Service or possibly the remote execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Python.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

The imageop module is no longer built in the unaffected versions.

All Python 2.3 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.3.6-r6"
```

All Python 2.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.4.4-r13"
```

---

## 1. Overview:

A new Sun Alert Notification from Sun Microsystems
has been issued and is described below. Additional information
about this issue may be found on the [sunsolve.sun.com](http://sunsolve.sun.com) website, although a maintenance contract with Sun may be required to view the information.

**273570**
Multiple Buffer and Integer Overflow Vulnerabilities in
Python (python(1)) May Lead to a Denial of Service
(DoS) or Allow Execution of Arbitrary Code

Product: Solaris 10 Operating System, OpenSolaris

Category: Security

Date Released: 11-Jan-2010
<http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-66-273570-1>

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2007-4965](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4965), [CVE-2008-1679](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1679), [CVE-2008-1721](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1721), and [CVE-2008-2315](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2315) to this issue.

## 2. Avaya System Products using Solaris 10 and Python:

Some Avaya system products are
delivered with an Operating System
from Sun Microsystems. Actions to be
taken on these products are described
below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CMS | R15, R16 | Low | Install patch 143506-01. |
| Avaya IR | 3.0, 4.0 | Low | Python is installed on IR by default, but is not enabled, configured, or supported. The Sun patch will not be tested for use on IR. If Python is used on IR, Avaya recommends using Sun's suggested workaround. |

**Recommended Actions:**

Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| ``` Just so you know, the scripts actually do two different things-- the bugs are both related to negative values though. One causes PyString_FromStringAndSize() to try an allocate zero bytes (the -24 one), the other causes like 22 bytes to get allocated and then takes advantage of the sign-conversion when the value is assigned to the zlib structure member (the member is unsigned, the value is signed)  Honestly, you guys should consider enforcing the safe downcast usage because signedness issues are all over your code base (as I'm sure you know) ``` | | | |

f. Updated Service Console package python

Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.
When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service.
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service.
An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721
CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143

g. Updated Service Console package bind

Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5
The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
is operating correctly.
A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.

h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
files.

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these
issues.

i. Updated Service Console package curl

Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5\_3.5
A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.

A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially
confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.
