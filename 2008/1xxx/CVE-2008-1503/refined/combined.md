F5 BIG-IP Web Management Audit Log XSS
Product: F5 BIG-IP
http://www.f5.com/products/big-ip/
The F5 BIG-IP web management interface contains a persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability in the audit log facility. Log entries are output raw, without being HTML-encoded first. This allows an attacker to create a log entry with an embedded script that gets executed any time the audit log is later reviewed by an administrator.
One of several exploit vectors is to create a node object with a script embedded in the node name. The creation will fail due to unsupported characters but an audit log entry still gets created. Other confirmed entry points are sysContact and sysLocation on the SNMP configuration page.
It is possible to craft URL links that would generate a suitable log entry with a simple HTTP GET request. This allows the attack to be carried out remotely.
The vulnerability has been identified in version 9.4.3. However, other versions may be also affected.
Solution:
Do not use the web management interface to review audit logs. Use SSH CLI instead.
