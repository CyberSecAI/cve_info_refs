```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The JoomlaXplorer component for Joomla! contains a local directory traversal vulnerability and an XSS vulnerability.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Local Directory Traversal: The `dir` parameter in the `show_error` action is vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing attackers to access files and directories outside the intended scope by using "../" sequences.
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The `error` parameter in the `show_error` action is vulnerable to XSS, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
- Impact of exploitation:
  - Local Directory Traversal: Attackers can potentially read sensitive files on the server's file system.
  - XSS: Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, which could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities.
- Attack vectors:
  - Local Directory Traversal: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a directory traversal sequence in the `dir` parameter of the `show_error` action.
  - XSS: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with JavaScript code in the `error` parameter of the `show_error` action.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable Joomla! application. The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges.
