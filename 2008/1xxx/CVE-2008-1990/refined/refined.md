Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1990:

**CVE-2008-1990** is one of multiple vulnerabilities identified in Acidcat CMS version 3.4.1.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is SQL injection in multiple locations, specifically in `default.asp` and `main_login2.asp`. This is due to unsanitized user inputs being used in database queries.
*  **Logical Vulnerability:** The email sending function allows arbitrary email sending without permission.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** There is an XSS vulnerability in `/admin/admin_colors_swatch.asp` due to unsanitized input.
*   **Insecure FCKEditor:**  An instance of FCKEditor is present without proper access control, allowing arbitrary file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to manipulate database queries.
*   **Insecure Email Functionality**: Allows sending emails without permission from the server.
*   **XSS:** Allows the injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** Via FCKEditor, allowing malicious file upload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Retrieval of usernames and encrypted passwords, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   Bypassing authentication and gaining admin access.
*   **Insecure Email Functionality:** Sending of arbitrary emails, could be used for phishing attacks.
*   **XSS:** Can lead to session hijacking, defacement or other malicious actions.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** Enables execution of arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** By crafting malicious queries in the `cID` parameter of `default.asp`, and in the username field of `main_login2.asp`
*   **Insecure Email Functionality:** By manipulating parameters in `default_mail_aspemail.asp`, `default_mail_cdosys.asp`, or `default_mail_jmail.asp`.
*   **XSS:** By crafting a malicious URL in `/admin/admin_colors_swatch.asp` with the `field` parameter.
*  **Insecure FCKEditor:** By uploading arbitrary files using `/admin/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/test.html`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the web application.
*   For the SQL injection, the attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax, which is not hard to obtain.
*   For the XSS,  the attacker needs to craft a malicious URL, and trick other users into visiting this URL.
*   For FCKEditor, the attacker needs to locate the exposed instance and have basic knowledge of file upload forms.
