Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1867:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `categorie` parameter within the `index.php` script of the Blog PixelMotion application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. This occurs because user-supplied input is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data within the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify or delete data stored in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, SQL injection can be used to gain administrative access to the application or even the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `index.php` script.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `categorie` parameter with malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable Blog PixelMotion application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker must have basic knowledge of SQL to craft the necessary SQL injection payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability since the `categorie` parameter is publicly accessible.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable URL is `http://[target]/index.php?categorie=[SQL]`
*   The exploit examples provided in the content demonstrate the injection of SQL statements using `UNION SELECT` to extract database information, including the database name and user credentials from the `blog_utilisateurs` table.
* Example payloads:
    * `http://www.xxx.org/blog/index.php?categorie=-1+union+select+0,1,2,database(),4,5,6/*`
    * `http://localhost/[script_path]/index.php?categorie=-1+union+select+1,2,concat(login,0x3a,pass),4,5,6+from+blog_utilisateurs/*`
