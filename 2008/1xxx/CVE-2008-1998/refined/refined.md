{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The NNSTAT procedure in IBM DB2 UDB allows for arbitrary file overwrites due to a lack of proper validation of the log file parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Arbitrary File Overwrite"
    ],
    "impact": "A low-privileged user can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files on the system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the database server.",
      "Exploiting the SYSPROC.NNSTAT procedure using a crafted log file parameter."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have valid database credentials to connect and execute the vulnerable procedure.",
     "additional_information": "The NNSTAT procedure is installed by default. The exploit can be executed remotely after authenticating to the database server."
