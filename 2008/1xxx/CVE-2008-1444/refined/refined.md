The attacker is remote, and successful exploitation requires convincing a user to open/access the crafted file."

      "analysis": "This document provides details about Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-033, which addresses multiple vulnerabilities including CVE-2008-1444.\n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because DirectX does not perform sufficient parsing of the parameters of Synchronized Accessible Media Interchange (SAMI) file types. Specifically, a stack overflow occurs when processing the \"Class Name\" variable due to a lack of bounds checking.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way DirectX handles SAMI files due to insufficient parsing, leading to a stack overflow.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take complete control of an affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.\n- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited if a user opens a specially crafted SAMI file.  This could occur through a specially crafted webpage or by sending the crafted file to a user via email or other means, where a user is convinced to open the file.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted SAMI file and then deliver it to a user. The user has to open the crafted SAMI file in order for the exploit to succeed. The attacker can be located remotely and does not need to be on the same network as the victim."
