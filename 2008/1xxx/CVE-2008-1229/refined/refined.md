```
- Root cause of vulnerability: An input validation problem exists within JSPWiki.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation:
  - Arbitrary local .jsp files can be executed (included), leading to the execution of arbitrary server-side script code with the privileges of the web server process.
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive .jsp files, resulting in information disclosure such as the full path of the application, page storage path, log files, and security configurations.
  - An attacker can upload a malicious .jsp file and locally execute it, potentially compromising the server.
- Attack vectors: By manipulating the 'editor' parameter in the `Edit.jsp` page request to include a path to a local .jsp file (e.g., `../../../rss`).
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable JSPWiki server and have knowledge of an existing page on the wiki.
