RELATED:
CVE-2008-1859 is related to an SQL injection vulnerability in iScripts Socialware.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the "id" parameter of the events.php page, allowing for SQL injection.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By crafting a malicious SQL query through the "id" parameter, an attacker can bypass intended SQL logic and execute arbitrary database queries.

Impact of exploitation:
- Database information disclosure: An attacker can retrieve sensitive information such as usernames, passwords (stored in plaintext), and email addresses.
- Remote code execution:  By exploiting the vulnerability to obtain admin credentials, an attacker can gain access to the administrative panel, and from there upload a malicious PHP shell to gain remote code execution.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted GET request to the `events.php` page. The malicious SQL injection is placed in the `id` parameter.
- File upload via admin panel: The exploit uses the SQLi to gain admin access and then a file upload vulnerability to upload a shell.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- Technical knowledge: The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax to craft malicious queries.
- Admin access to upload a shell: After exploiting the SQLi the attacker needs access to the admin interface to upload a malicious file.
