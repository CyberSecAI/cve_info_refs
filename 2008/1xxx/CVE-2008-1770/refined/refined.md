Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1770

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Akamai Download Manager ActiveX control (versions prior to 2.2.3.7) has a vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to download arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on the victim's machine. This occurs due to insufficient validation of the parameters passed to the ActiveX control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** The ActiveX control can be manipulated to download a file from a specified URL.
- **Arbitrary File Location:** The downloaded file can be saved to a specified location on the victim's file system, bypassing typical browser security restrictions.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `URL` parameter within the ActiveX object is not properly sanitized. This allows the attacker to specify both the download URL and the local save path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By downloading a malicious executable to a startup location, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's system upon reboot or user login.
- **Malware Installation:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to install malware without the user's consent or knowledge.
- **System Compromise:**  Full system compromise can be achieved via malware deployment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploited remotely through a web page containing malicious HTML/JavaScript code.
- **ActiveX Control:** The Akamai Download Manager ActiveX control is the target of the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page that the victim is tricked into visiting.
- The attacker must know the CLSID of the vulnerable Akamai Download Manager ActiveX control.
- The attacker must be able to host the malicious payload they intend to download on the victim machine
- The attacker leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control to perform the file download and save to a specific location.

**Additional Notes**
The provided exploit code demonstrates how to embed the vulnerable ActiveX control into a webpage, specify an arbitrary URL, and designate an arbitrary download location to run arbitrary code on the targeted system.
The exploit uses `calc.exe` as a demonstration of code execution, but it can be replaced with any other executable by the attacker.
