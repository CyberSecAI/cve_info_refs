  "CVE-2008-1945": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple",
      "Original Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "A flaw in QEMU's block format auto-detection when running fully-virtualized guests and using QEMU images written on removable media (USB storage, 3.5\" disks).",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Insecure handling of removable media and USB disk devices.",
        "Lack of validation when a guest writes a header to the disk image describing another format."
      ],
      "Impact": "Privileged users of fully-virtualized guests with a raw-formatted disk image can write a header to that disk image describing another format, which could allow such guests to read arbitrary files in their hypervisor's host (Dom0).",
      "Attack vector": "Local access by a privileged user within a fully-virtualized guest OS (DomU).",
      "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to have privileged access within the guest OS and the ability to write to the disk image on removable media."
    },
