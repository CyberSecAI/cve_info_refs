## Synopsis

Important: xen security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0892)

## Topic

Updated xen packages that resolve a couple of security issues and fix a bug
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The xen packages contain tools for managing the virtual machine monitor in
Red Hat Virtualization.

It was discovered that the hypervisor's para-virtualized framebuffer (PVFB)
backend failed to validate the frontend's framebuffer description properly.
This could allow a privileged user in the unprivileged domain (DomU) to
cause a denial of service, or, possibly, elevate privileges to the
privileged domain (Dom0). (CVE-2008-1952)

A flaw was found in the QEMU block format auto-detection, when running
fully-virtualized guests and using Qemu images written on removable media
(USB storage, 3.5" disks). Privileged users of such fully-virtualized
guests (DomU), with a raw-formatted disk image, were able to write a header
to that disk image describing another format. This could allow such guests
to read arbitrary files in their hypervisor's host (Dom0). (CVE-2008-1945)

Additionally, the following bug is addressed in this update:

* The qcow-create command terminated when invoked due to glibc bounds

checking on the realpath() function.

Users of xen are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
resolve these security issues and fix this bug.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=445844#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-05-09 11:15:49 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Chris Wright has reported the following qemu removable (usb, floppy) media related problem (pointed out by Markus Armbruster):  Previous commit didn't handle removable media or USB (thanks to Markus for noting this).  This patch adds a cmdline option for USB to allow admin to specify format type.  To avoid changing exists semantics a new option -usbdevice diskformat: is added (ugly name). This is valid from both command line and monitor interface.  Because of the comma delimiter, admin must use ',,' just as in -drive file=filename.  The patch also allows specifying image format when changing removable media.  It is an optional argument to the monitor command "change," so there is no change to existing semantics.  Longer term it'd be better to provide some safe defaults.  Additional info:  This issue is related with qemu block format auto-detection vulnerability ([CVE-2008-2004](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-2004)).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=445844#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-05-09 11:17:29 UTC  ``` Proposed patch from Chris Wright:  ---  hw/usb-msd.c  |   12 ++++++++++--  hw/usb.h      |    2 +-  monitor.c     |   20 ++++++++++++++------  qemu-doc.texi |    4 ++++  vl.c          |   13 ++++++++++++-  5 files changed, 41 insertions(+), 10 deletions(-)  diff --git a/hw/usb-msd.c b/hw/usb-msd.c index 01d492d..3c3f39a 100644 --- a/hw/usb-msd.c +++ b/hw/usb-msd.c @@ -513,17 +513,25 @@ static void usb_msd_handle_destroy(USBDevice *dev)      qemu_free(s);  }   -USBDevice *usb_msd_init(const char *filename) +USBDevice *usb_msd_init(const char *filename, const char *fmt)  {      MSDState *s;      BlockDriverState *bdrv; +    BlockDriver *drv = NULL;   +    if (fmt) { +        drv = bdrv_find_format(fmt); +        if (!drv) { +            fprintf(stderr, "%s: '%s' invalid format\n", __func__, fmt); +            return NULL; +        } +    }      s = qemu_mallocz(sizeof(MSDState));      if (!s)          return NULL;        bdrv = bdrv_new("usb"); -    if (bdrv_open(bdrv, filename, 0) < 0) +    if (bdrv_open2(bdrv, filename, 0, drv) < 0)          goto fail;      if (qemu_key_check(bdrv, filename))          goto fail; diff --git a/hw/usb.h b/hw/usb.h index 9b759d4..a2cb313 100644 --- a/hw/usb.h +++ b/hw/usb.h @@ -217,7 +217,7 @@ USBDevice *usb_tablet_init(void);  USBDevice *usb_keyboard_init(void);    /* usb-msd.c */ -USBDevice *usb_msd_init(const char *filename); +USBDevice *usb_msd_init(const char *filename, const char *fmt);    /* usb-wacom.c */  USBDevice *usb_wacom_init(void); diff --git a/monitor.c b/monitor.c index 236b827..8d79d5c 100644 --- a/monitor.c +++ b/monitor.c @@ -405,18 +405,26 @@ static void do_eject(int force, const char *filename)      eject_device(bs, force);  }   -static void do_change_block(const char *device, const char *filename) +static void do_change_block(const char *device, const char *filename, const char *fmt)  {      BlockDriverState *bs; +    BlockDriver *drv = NULL;        bs = bdrv_find(device);      if (!bs) {          term_printf("device not found\n");          return;      } +    if (fmt) { +        drv = bdrv_find_format(fmt); +        if (!drv) { +            term_printf("invalid format %s\n", fmt); +            return; +        } +    }      if (eject_device(bs, 0) < 0)          return; -    bdrv_open(bs, filename, 0); +    bdrv_open2(bs, filename, 0, drv);      qemu_key_check(bs, filename);  }   @@ -435,12 +443,12 @@ static void do_change_vnc(const char *target)      }  }   -static void do_change(const char *device, const char *target) +static void do_change(const char *device, const char *target, const char *fmt)  {      if (strcmp(device, "vnc") == 0) {         do_change_vnc(target);      } else { -       do_change_block(device, target); +       do_change_block(device, target, fmt);      }  }   @@ -1322,8 +1330,8 @@ static term_cmd_t term_cmds[] = {        "", "quit the emulator" },      { "eject", "-fB", do_eject,        "[-f] device", "eject a removable medium (use -f to force it)" }, -    { "change", "BF", do_change, -      "device filename", "change a removable medium" }, +    { "change", "BFs?", do_change, +      "device filename [format]", "change a removable medium, optional format" },      { "screendump", "F", do_screen_dump,        "filename", "save screen into PPM image 'filename'" },      { "logfile", "s", do_logfile, diff --git a/qemu-doc.texi b/qemu-doc.texi index 4a48f43..34743f2 100644 --- a/qemu-doc.texi +++ b/qemu-doc.texi @@ -547,6 +547,10 @@ mouse.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- multipath-tools
Default permissions on the multipathd socket file were to generous
and allowed any user to connect (CVE-2009-0115).
Affected products: SLES9, OES, NLD9
- bluez
The dbus package used a too permissive configuration. Therefore intended
access control for some services was not applied (CVE-2008-4311).
The new configuration denies access by default. Some dbus services may
break due to this setting and need an updated configuration as well.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3
- xntp
ntp didn't properly check the return value of the openssl function
EVP\_VerifyFinal (CVE-2009-0021).
Additionally a problem where ntpd refused to use keys from /etc/ntp.keys
has been fixed.
Affected products: SLES10-SP2
- apache-mod\_php4
Specially crafted strings could trigger a heap based buffer overflow
in the php mbstring extension. Attackers could potenially exploit
that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-5557).
Affected products: SLES9, OES
- apache2-mod\_php5
php 5.2.9 fixes among other things some security issues:
+ Missing bounds checks of an error in the imageRotate function of
the gd extension potentially allowed attackers to read portions of
memory (CVE-2008-5498).
+ the mbstring.func\_overload in .htaccess was applied to other virtual
hosts on th same machine (CVE-2009-0754)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- struts
Insufficient quoting of parameters allowed attackers to conduct
cross site scripting (XSS) attacks (CVE-2008-2025).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- qemu
qemu update to version 0.10.1 fixes the following security issues:
+ CVE-2008-0928: problems with range checks of block devices
+ CVE-2008-1945: problems with removable media handling
+ CVE-2008-2382: vnc server DoS
+ CVE-2008-4539: fix a heap overflow in the cirrus VGA implementation
+ CVE-2008-5714: off by one error in vnc password handling
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- libsndfile
Specially crafted CAF files could cause an integer overflow in
libsndfile (CVE-2009-0186).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- phpMyAdmin
This update of phpMyAdmin fixes multiple vulnerabilities:
+ CVE-2009-1148: directory traversal
+ CVE-2009-1149: CRLF injection
+ CVE-2009-1150: cross-site scripting
+ CVE-2009-1151: static code injection
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=447759#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-05-21 16:55:10 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The recent fix to validate the frontend's frame buffer description neglected to limit the frame buffer size correctly. This lets a malicious frontend make the backend attempt to map an arbitrary amount of guest memory, which could be useful for a denial of service attack against dom0.  Proposed upstream patch:  <http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/9044705960cb30cec385bdca7305bcf7db096721>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=447759#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-05-21 17:59:32 UTC  ``` This fix is a sophisticated solution (another catch) for [CVE-2008-1943](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-1943).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=447759#c3)  Chris Lalancette    2009-09-11 09:01:20 UTC  ``` This is fixed in all the relevant streams, so closing this tracker as CURRENTRELEASE.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-776-1: KVM vulnerabilities

12 May 2009

KVM vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [kvm](/security/cves?package=kvm) -

## Details

Avi Kivity discovered that KVM did not correctly handle certain disk

formats. A local attacker could attach a malicious partition that

would allow the guest VM to read files on the VM host. ([CVE-2008-1945](/security/CVE-2008-1945),

[CVE-2008-2004](/security/CVE-2008-2004))

Alfredo Ortega discovered that KVM's VNC protocol handler did not

correctly validate certain messages. A remote attacker could send

specially crafted VNC messages that would cause KVM to consume CPU

resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-2382](/security/CVE-2008-2382))

Jan Niehusmann discovered that KVM's Cirrus VGA implementation over VNC

did not correctly handle certain bitblt operations. A local attacker

could exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code on the VM

host or crash KVM, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-4539](/security/CVE-2008-4539))

It was discovered that KVM's VNC password checks did not use the correct

length. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause KVM to crash,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5714](/security/CVE-2008-5714))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [kvm](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/kvm)
  -
  [1:72+dfsg-1ubuntu6.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/kvm/1%3A72%2Bdfsg-1ubuntu6.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [kvm](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/kvm)
  -
  [1:62+dfsg-0ubuntu8.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/kvm/1%3A62%2Bdfsg-0ubuntu8.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart all KVM VMs to effect

the necessary changes.

CVE ID         : CVE-2008-0928 CVE-2008-4539 CVE-2008-1945

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the QEMU processor
emulator. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2008-0928

    Ian Jackson discovered that range checks of file operations on
    emulated disk devices were insufficiently enforced.

    host system.

CVE-2008-4539

    A buffer overflow has been found in the emulation of the Cirrus
    graphics adaptor.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
