  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) through the 'code' parameter in 'mod/mod.extmanager.php'.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a POST request to 'mod/mod.extmanager.php' with the 'extmanager_install' parameter, which contains a URL pointing to a malicious PHP file. The 'code' parameter is used to pass PHP code to be evaluated.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a web server to host their malicious PHP file."
