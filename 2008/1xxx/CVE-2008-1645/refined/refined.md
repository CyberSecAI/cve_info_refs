```
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the `filename` parameter in `body.php` is not properly sanitized. It allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path, which is then read by `file_get_contents()` and processed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Disclosure",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, system files (e.g., /etc/passwd), and source code.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious HTTP request with a `filename` parameter pointing to a sensitive file. For instance: `/phpspammanager.0.53.dev/body.php?filename=include/config.inc.php` or `/phpspammanager.0.53.dev/body.php?filename=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific privileges are needed, making it a remote, unauthenticated attack."
