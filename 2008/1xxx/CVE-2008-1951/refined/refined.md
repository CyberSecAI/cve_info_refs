{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2008-1951",
    "description": "It was discovered that certain sblim libraries had an RPATH (runtime library search path) set in the ELF (Executable and Linking Format) header. This RPATH pointed to a sub-directory of a world-writable, temporary directory. A local user could create a file with the same name as a library required by sblim (such as libc.so) and place it in the directory defined in the RPATH. This file could then execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running an application that used sblim (eg tog-pegasus).",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an insecure RPATH (runtime library search path) setting in the ELF header of the sblim libraries. This RPATH points to a subdirectory within a world-writable temporary directory, allowing local users to exploit it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure RPATH configuration",
      "Use of world-writable temporary directory for library search path"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application using sblim.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local user creates a malicious library with the same name as a required sblim library (e.g., libc.so)",
      "User places the malicious library in the directory specified in the RPATH of the sblim libraries"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have local user access to the system.",
       "additional_information": "The vulnerable RPATH was located at /var/tmp/sblim-<version>-<release>-root-brewbuilder//usr/lib. The affected applications are those which make use of the sblim library, such as tog-pegasus."
