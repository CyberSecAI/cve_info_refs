Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1541:

**1. Verification:**
The content from exploit-db.com directly references CVE-2008-1541 and provides details of a vulnerability related to it.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation of the `t` parameter in the `his-webshop.pl` script. This allows an attacker to manipulate the parameter, injecting directory traversal sequences.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (Directory Traversal):** The application does not properly sanitize the `t` parameter, which allows an attacker to use `../` sequences to navigate the file system outside of the intended directory.
- **Remote File Disclosure:** Due to the path traversal, the application can be tricked into disclosing arbitrary files from the server.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, configuration files, source code, or user data.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through an HTTP request to the `his-webshop.pl` script, by manipulating the `t` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable `his-webshop.pl` script. No prior authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit uses URL encoded directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`) in the `t` parameter. The `%00` is a null byte injection, which can terminate string parsing prematurely on some systems.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db.com entry provides a clear example of how to exploit the vulnerability with a specific URL and indicates that the vulnerability was discovered on 2008-03-24.
*  The content from securityreason.com is a captcha prompt, which is unrelated to the CVE.
*  The content from vupen.com and secunia.com do not provide information related to this specific CVE and are therefore not analyzed.

**Summary:**
CVE-2008-1541 is a remote file disclosure vulnerability in `his-webshop.pl` due to insufficient validation of the `t` parameter, leading to path traversal. This allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files from the server.
