{
  "CVE-2008-1149": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "phpMyAdmin used the $_REQUEST superglobal as a source for parameters, which includes $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE data. This allowed an attacker to set a malicious cookie that would override user-submitted parameters.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious SQL queries that would be executed with the privileges of the user authenticating in phpMyAdmin, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or unauthorized access.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker tricks the victim into visiting a malicious web application, hosted on the same domain as phpMyAdmin, that sets a cookie with the name of a phpMyAdmin parameter (e.g., 'sql_query'). When the victim subsequently accesses phpMyAdmin, the malicious cookie is used.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website on the same domain as the phpMyAdmin installation and be able to trick the victim to access it before accessing phpMyAdmin."
