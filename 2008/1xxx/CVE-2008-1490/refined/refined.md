Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Relates to CVE-2008-1490:** No, the provided content discusses a potential vulnerability in "Pizco" related to "Aurigma ImageUploader4.ocx". CVE-2008-1490 is for a vulnerability in "IBM WebSphere Application Server".

**Analysis of the Content**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the "Aurigma ImageUploader4.ocx" ActiveX control, which is suspected to also be present in the Pizco software. The vulnerability in "Aurigma ImageUploader4.ocx" was previously reported (BID 27539).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  The vulnerability is a buffer overflow within the ActiveX control. This can occur when the control processes more data than allocated for a buffer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact of exploitation is not explicitly stated in this content but generally, a buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This means an attacker could potentially gain control of the user's system by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious website using the vulnerable ActiveX control. A user browsing to a compromised or specially crafted site would load the control, and an attacker could then trigger the overflow.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to host or inject code into a webpage.
    *   The user must visit this page and use a browser that loads ActiveX controls.

**Additional Information:**

* The post indicates that the specific vulnerable version of Aurigma ImageUploader4 is 4.1.36.0
* The author found a CAB file `piczo_fast_uploader.cab` which contains the vulnerable control.
*  The author doesn't explicitly state that they have confirmed the vulnerability in the Pizco software, but suggests it is likely.
