Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-1002:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Apple Safari processes JavaScript URLs. Specifically, there is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the handling of `javascript:` URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page. In this case, the vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of `javascript:` URLs.
- **Insufficient Validation:**  Safari's lack of proper validation for `javascript:` URLs is the technical weakness that enables the XSS attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the security context of a different website. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Defacing websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted Web Page:** The primary attack vector involves enticing a user to visit a specially crafted web page containing a malicious `javascript:` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and host a malicious webpage or inject the malicious code into a vulnerable website.
- The attacker must also lure users into visiting the malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was reported by Robert Swiecki of Google Information Security Team.
- The issue is addressed in Apple Safari 3.1 and later, which includes "additional validation of javascript: URLs".
- CERT/CC assigned VU#766019 to track this specific vulnerability.
