      "Impact of exploitation": "Unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution",
      "Attack vectors": "Applications calling the strfmon function with format strings containing large integer values.",

        "Integer overflow when parsing width specifiers",
        "Unchecked sum of `left_prec` and `right_prec`",
        "Insufficient bounds checking in memory allocation and string formatting related to precision and width parameters."

      "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption, leading to segmentation faults, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. Memory exhaustion by allocating excessive memory.",
      "Attack vectors": "Crafted format strings passed to the `strfmon` function, triggering large width or precision values.",

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow vulnerabilities within the `GET_NUMBER` macro in the strfmon function of the C library.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Integer overflows in the `GET_NUMBER` macro due to lack of input validation.",
        "Unchecked sums of `left_prec` and `right_prec` that result in out of bounds writes when formatting a string with `snprintf`.",
        "Lack of proper size validation when creating format strings for other printing functions such as `asprintf`."

       "Impact of exploitation": "Crashes, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution by manipulating the format string argument to the strfmon function.",
      "Attack vectors": "Crafting a malicious format string with large numeric values to trigger the integer overflows in the `GET_NUMBER` macro and other integer operations within `strfmon`.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to control or influence the format string argument that is passed to the `strfmon` function, which is often a result of processing user provided data."
