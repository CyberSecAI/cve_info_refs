```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `id` parameter in the `com_garyscookbook` component for Mambo is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including usernames and password hashes of system users.
- Attack vectors: By manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
