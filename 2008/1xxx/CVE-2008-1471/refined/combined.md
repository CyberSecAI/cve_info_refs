Advisory: Panda Internet Security/Antivirus+Firewall 2008
cpoint.sys Kernel Driver Memory Corruption
Vulnerability
Advisory ID: TKADV2008-001
Revision: 1.1
Release Date: 2008/03/08
Last Modified: 2008/12/20
Date Reported: 2008/01/08
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: Panda Internet Security 2008
Panda Antivirus+Firewall 2008
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
Vendor URL: http://www.pandasecurity.com
Vendor Status: Vendor has released a hotfix
CVE-ID: CVE-2008-1471
Patch development time: 60 days
======================
Vulnerability Details:
======================
The kernel driver cpoint.sys shipped with Panda Internet Security and
Antivirus+Firewall 2008 contains a vulnerability in the code that handles
IOCTL requests. Exploitation of this vulnerability can result in:
1) local denial of service attacks (system crash due to a kernel panic), or
2) local execution of arbitrary code at the kernel level (complete system
compromise)
The issue can be triggered by sending a specially crafted IOCTL request.
No special user rights are necessary to exploit the vulnerability.
==================
Technical Details:
==================
The IOCTL call 0xba002848 of the cpoint.sys kernel driver shipped with
Panda Internet Security/Antivirus+Firewall 2008 accepts user supplied input
that doesn't get validated enough. In consequence it is possible to cause
an out-of-bound write in kernel memory.
Disassembly of cpoint.sys (Windows Vista 32bit version):

[...]
(1) Vulnerable IOCTL call
(2) IOCTL input size check
(3) The user supplied data is copied into esi
(4) + (5) Minor input data checks
- From this point there are two different vulnerable code paths. Both will
be described in the following:
Vulnerable code path 1:
[...]
.text:00012906 lea ecx, [esi+0Ch] <-- (6)
[...]
.text:00012909 loc\_12909:
.text:00012909 mov edx, [ecx] <-- (7)
.text:0001290B mov OVERWRITTEN\_DATA[eax\*4], edx <-- (8)
.text:00012912 inc eax
.text:00012913 add ecx, 4
.text:00012916 cmp eax, [esi+8] <-- (9)
.text:00012919 jb short loc\_12909
[...]
(6) Some user controlled data is copied into ecx
(7) The user controlled data is copied into edx
(8) The user controlled data is copied (as dwords) at the memory location
OVERWRITTEN\_DATA
(9) The size of the copied data (loop counter in eax) can be controlled by
the user
This leads to an out-of-bound write in kernel memory.
Vulnerable code path 2:
[...]
.text:0001291B loc\_1291B:
.text:0001291B xor eax, eax
.text:0001291D cmp [esi+10Ch], eax <-- (10)
.text:00012923 jbe loc\_129B4
[...]
.text:00012929 lea ecx, [esi+110h] <-- (11)
[...]
.text:0001292F loc\_1292F:
.text:0001292F mov edx, [ecx] <-- (12)
.text:00012931 mov OVERWRITTEN\_DATA2[eax\*4], edx <-- (13)
.text:00012938 inc eax
.text:00012939 add ecx, 4
.text:0001293C cmp eax, [esi+10Ch] <-- (14)
.text:00012942 jb short loc\_1292F
[...]
(10) Minor check of the user controlled data
(11) Some user controlled data is copied into ecx
(12) The user controlled data is copied into edx
(13) The user controlled data is copied (as dwords) at the memory location
OVERWRITTEN\_DATA2
(14) The size of the copied data (loop counter in eax) can be controlled by
the user
This leads to an out-of-bound write in kernel memory.
In both cases it is possible to write an arbitrary amount of user
controlled data into kernel memory. As the data that gets overwritten is in
the data section of the cpoint.sys kernel driver it is possible to control
adjacent data structures (e.g. some KEVENT structures). If these structures
are overwritten with carefully crafted data it is possible to force the
windows kernel into performing a memory corruption that leads to full
control of the kernel execution flow.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
