Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1086:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the `hxvz.dll` ActiveX control. This control, when used in Internet Explorer, can corrupt the system state, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Memory Corruption:** The ActiveX control `hxvz.dll` is susceptible to memory corruption.
-   **ActiveX Control Vulnerability:**  The core issue lies within the way the hxvz.dll ActiveX control handles memory, leading to exploitable corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
-   **Privilege Escalation:**  The attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-on user, potentially leading to full system control if the user has administrative privileges. An attacker with administrative rights could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Web-Based Attack:** Attackers can host a malicious webpage that exploits the vulnerability. This can be achieved through:
    -   Compromised websites
    -   Websites hosting user-provided content/advertisements
-   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website, typically by luring them through links in emails or instant messages, banner advertisements, or other methods of delivering web content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote.
-   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to employ social engineering techniques to trick users into visiting the malicious website.
-   **Malicious Website:**  The attacker needs to host a website containing specially crafted content to trigger the vulnerability.
-   **Understanding of ActiveX exploitation:** The attacker has knowledge to exploit the specific ActiveX control.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Kill Bit:** The security update addresses the vulnerability by setting a "kill bit" in Internet Explorer. This prevents the vulnerable ActiveX control from being loaded, effectively blocking the exploit even if the control is present on the system.
*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability impacts multiple versions of Windows, with varying severity ratings. It is rated as Critical for older systems like Windows 2000 and Windows XP, and Important for Windows Vista. It is rated as low for server editions of windows 2008.
*   **Third-Party Kill Bits:** The update also includes kill bits for other vulnerable ActiveX controls, such as those from Yahoo! Music Jukebox. This indicates that the kill bit mechanism is used to address vulnerabilities in third party software as well.
*   **Mitigating Factors:** Running Internet Explorer in Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Server 2003 and 2008 can mitigate the risk as it sets the internet zone to high. The ActiveX control is not included in the default allow-list in IE7.
*   **Workarounds:** The workaround is to manually set the kill bit for the control using the registry which will disable the control and prevent it from running in Internet Explorer.
