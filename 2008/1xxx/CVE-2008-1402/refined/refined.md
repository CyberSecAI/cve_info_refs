Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-1402, as well as related vulnerabilities, affecting MG-SOFT Net Inspector:

**Vulnerabilities Identified:**

*   **A] Format String Vulnerability in `mghttpd`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `mghttpd` service, a simple HTTP daemon running on port 5228, has a format string vulnerability in the function that logs client requests.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper handling of user-supplied input within the logging function allows format string specifiers to be interpreted by the application, potentially leading to information disclosure or remote code execution.
    *  **Impact:** An attacker can potentially read arbitrary memory locations or execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests containing format string specifiers (e.g., `%n`, `%s`).
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

*   **B] Directory Traversal Vulnerability in `mghttpd`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `mghttpd` service is vulnerable to directory traversal.
    *   **Weakness:** The service doesn't properly sanitize user-provided file paths allowing the use of `..` sequences in file requests.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can access and download arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending HTTP GET requests containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `\../`).
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

*   **C] Crash in `MgWTrap3`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The SNMP Trap Service (`MgWTrap3`) binds to a dynamically assigned UDP port in addition to the standard ports.
    *   **Weakness:** Sending a UDP packet to this dynamically assigned port causes an exception that terminates the service.
    *   **Impact:**  The vulnerability causes a denial of service by crashing the `MgWTrap3` service, which is a core component of many MG-SOFT products.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending a UDP packet to the dynamically assigned port. The content of the packet does not matter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the vulnerable service, and discover the dynamic UDP port.

*  **D] Denial of Service in `niengine`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The Net Inspector Fault Management server (`niengine`) is susceptible to denial of service
    *   **Weakness:** The server can be frozen through a malformed or incomplete packet.
    *   **Impact:** The server experiences 100% CPU usage and full memory consumption, leading to a denial-of-service.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending a malformed or incomplete packet to the `niengine` service.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the vulnerable service.

**Affected Software:**

*   MG-SOFT Net Inspector <= 6.5.0.828
*   Other MG-SOFT products that use the MgWTrap3 service (e.g., MIB Browser, Query Manager, Trap Ringer Pro).

**Platforms:**

*   Windows and Linux.

**Exploitation:**

*   Remote exploitation for all vulnerabilities.

**Fix:**

*   New versions of the affected software were released on April 7th, 2008, to fix the bugs.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides detailed proof-of-concept exploit code for each of the vulnerabilities.
*   The identified vulnerabilities impact multiple MG-SOFT products, making the issue widespread.
