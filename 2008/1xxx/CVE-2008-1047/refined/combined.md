How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Tiki **1.9.10.1** (a quickfix of never released 1.9.10) was released by Louis-Philippe Huberdeau and Marc Laporte on 2008-02-23.

Compared to 1.9.9, this release contains 78 code commits by franck, lphuberdeau, luciash, marclaporte, mose, nkoth and sylvieg from 2007-12-22 to 2008-02-23.

The main purposes of this release are:

1. Fix bugs introduced in 1.9.9
2. Deal with a [Cross Site Scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting "External link") (XSS) vulnerability reported by Fortify Software.
3. Make TikiWiki more secure against future potential vulnerabilities (hardened TikiWiki)

## Regression bugs introduced in 1.9.10.1 (which were ok in 1.9.9)

(07:01:41) peter__: Hello
(07:03:16) peter__: Just installed Tiki and now have the problem that the registration code as image does not show up (tiki-random_number). Any suggestions?
(07:04:35) sylvieg: check you have imagick or gd installed
(07:05:32) peter__: gd is installed and for example pictures are shown in galleries.
(07:17:38) marclaporte: peter__: which version?
(07:17:55) marclaporte: I saw a bug fix to that file recently (dunno if related)
(07:29:47) lphuberdeau_: problem introduced in 1.9.10 or 1.9.10.1 with the additional checks
(07:30:06) lphuberdeau_: fix is in CVS, was waiting for more reports before making an other release
(07:32:51) lphuberdeau_: tiki-login_validate.php and tiki-random_num_img.php were modified since the release
(07:33:58) marclaporte: you can get them here: http://tikiwiki.cvs.sourceforge.net/tikiwiki/tiki/?pathrev=BRANCH-1-9
(08:29:06) peter__: lphuberdeau_: Thanks for the hint!
(08:39:48) peter__: Report: tiki-login_validate.php and tiki-random_num_img.php from CVS fixed the problem with the registration code image. Thanks.
```

This was a bug introduced while making Tiki more secure (a little too secure in this case😊). Below are the tweaks needed to be done to 1.9.10.1:

<http://tikiwiki.cvs.sourceforge.net/tikiwiki/tiki/tiki-login_validate.php?r1=1.9.2.10&r2=1.9.2.11&pathrev=BRANCH-1-9>

<http://tikiwiki.cvs.sourceforge.net/tikiwiki/tiki/tiki-random_num_img.php?r1=1.5.2.3&r2=1.5.2.4&pathrev=BRANCH-1-9>

## Security

* Improving input sanitizer. Thank you to [Fortify software](http://www.fortifysoftware.com/ "External link") for reporting a [cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in tiki-edit\_article.php](http://dev.tiki.org/tiki-view_tracker_item.php?itemId=1498 "External link").

  **Note**: Until you upgrade, workaround is to *not* permit non-trusted users to add/edit articles, or to deactivate the [articles feature](http://doc.tiki.org/tiki-index.php?page=Articles&bl "External link") altogether.
* New pre-emptive securitycheck.php script. This check, which is now part of the release procedures, checks every single potentially dangerous file (.php, .sh, etc) to make sure it follows some basic checks (such as: a feature check, permission check, verify that it can't be called directly if it shouldn't, etc.). If you are not using feature X you will no longer potentially be affected in a security issue which is discovered in a feature using that file. If you are using that feature, you can turn it off until you upgrade.
* Adding feature and permission checks to all files to comply with the securitycheck.php script described above.
* Developer scripts now have extra protection to make sure they can't be run from the web (on a badly configured server).
* Some useless files were deleted.

## Fixes

* Fix a username/password/registration bug issue which was introduced in 1.9.9.
* [Image Gallery](http://doc.tiki.org/tiki-index.php?page=Image+Gallery&bl "External link"): Fixed the next-prev glitch which was introduced recently.
* Various fixes to [Live Support feature](http://doc.tiki.org/tiki-index.php?page=Live+Support&bl "External link").
* Various fixes to [InterTiki feature](http://doc.tiki.org/tiki-index.php?page=Intertiki&bl "External link")
* [Forums](http://doc.tiki.org/tiki-index.php?page=Forum&bl "External link"): Prevent forum pruning from removing comments as well, or from other forums.
* Fixes to "thumbnail" plugin

## Enhancements

* Better handling of usernames with special characters
* [tiki-contact.php](http://doc.tiki.org/tiki-index.php?page=Contact+us "External link") has anti-bot protection
* Some administrative fixes and enhancements to the release, security and developer scripts.
* New "superscript" plugin to make easy superscript in wiki page, without using html, like subscript plugin.
