# Cisco and Vocera wireless LAN VoIP devices don't check certificates

Looks like Vocera's wireless LAN VoIP communicators don't bother to
cryptographically confirm the validity of a digital certificate because
it's too much "processing overhead required".  This is clearly stated in
the Vocera documentation.  I am also waiting for verification on Cisco's
wireless VoIP handsets.  I heard that the Cisco devices have the same
design flaw, but it's fairly simple to confirm if you have one of those
wireless LAN VoIP handsets.

That means you can basically put up your own bogus access point with a
rogue RADIUS backend with your own self-signed digital certificate
claiming it's the same as the certificate the client is use to seeing.
Since the client never bothers to cryptographically check the signature,
it thinks it's talking to the right server and it will send its hashed
password or pin to the server making it very easy to crack.

I have more details here:

# Cisco confirms vulnerability in 7921 Wi-Fi IP phone

```
Two days after news of the Vocera Wi-Fi VoIP communicator PEAP security
bypass vulnerability, I received confirmation from Cisco that their
model
7921 Wi-Fi VoIP phone is also vulnerable to the same issue where digital
certificates aren't cryptographically verified.  Both Cisco and Vocera
have told me that they intend to fix future implementations of PEAP and
do the necessary steps to ensure certificate authenticity.  Cisco
released the following statement.

"Cisco confirms that the Cisco wireless IP phone model 7921 does not
currently validate server certificates when configured to use PEAP
(MS-CHAPv2). The Cisco 7920 model does not support PEAP. Cisco is
planning a long term solution to enable the option of client-side
validation of server certificates with PEAP; however, we do not
currently have a time line for when a software upgrade will be
available. To work around the problem, administrators can configure
EAP-TLS as an alternative to PEAP while ensuring mutual client-server
authentication."
