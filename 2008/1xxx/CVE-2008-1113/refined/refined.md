Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of cryptographic verification of digital certificates in wireless LAN VoIP devices when using Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP). Specifically, the devices do not check the signature of the certificate presented by the RADIUS server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Certificate Validation:** The primary vulnerability is that the devices do not validate the authenticity of digital certificates during the PEAP authentication process. This includes not checking the signature of the certificate.
*   **PEAP MS-CHAPv2 Vulnerability:** The vulnerability specifically impacts the use of PEAP with MS-CHAPv2.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** An attacker can set up a rogue access point that mimics the legitimate network.
*   **Credential Theft:** By presenting a self-signed, bogus certificate, the attacker can trick the VoIP device into connecting to their access point. The device will then send its hashed password or PIN to the rogue server, which allows the attacker to crack the credentials.
*   **Unauthorized Access:**  Successful exploitation grants the attacker unauthorized access to the VoIP system or potentially the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Rogue Access Point:** The primary attack vector is setting up a rogue access point with a malicious RADIUS server.
*   **Self-Signed Certificate:** The attacker uses a self-signed digital certificate that claims to be from the legitimate RADIUS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the targeted VoIP devices.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of setting up a rogue access point, configuring a RADIUS server, and generating self-signed certificates.
*   **Wireless Network:** Ability to create a wireless network that will be presented to the user devices.

**Affected Devices:**

*   Vocera wireless LAN VoIP communicators
*   Cisco 7921 Wi-Fi VoIP phones (Note: Cisco 7920 is not affected as it doesn't support PEAP)

**Additional Details:**

*   Cisco has acknowledged the vulnerability in their 7921 model and stated they plan a long-term solution for client-side certificate validation with PEAP, but there is no timeline for a software update.
*   Cisco recommends administrators configure EAP-TLS as an alternative to PEAP to mitigate this issue by ensuring mutual client-server authentication.
