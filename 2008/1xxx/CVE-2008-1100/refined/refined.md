Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2008-1100:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow exists within the `cli_scanpe()` function in `libclamav/pe.c` when processing Upack-packed PE (Portable Executable) binaries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running ClamAV.
- Denial of service: The vulnerability could also lead to a crash of the ClamAV service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- By enticing a user or automated system to scan a specially crafted file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious file to be scanned by a vulnerable ClamAV instance. The attacker does not need any credentials or be on the same system as the vulnerable software.

**Additional notes:**
- The ClamAV team had implemented a workaround for older versions of ClamAV by disabling the scanning of PE files packed with upack, preventing exploitation of this vulnerability until a full fix was available.
- This vulnerability is specific to ClamAV's handling of Upack-packed PE files.
- The vulnerability is addressed in ClamAV version 0.93 and later.
- Several sources also mention other CVEs patched in the same ClamAV update.
