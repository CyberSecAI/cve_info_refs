  "CVE-2008-1073": {
    "related_content": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to improper handling of HTML output when generating reports in IBM Internet Scanner. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize the output when creating HTML reports.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary script into the generated HTML report, which can then be executed by a user's web browser when the report is viewed. This can allow an attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform other actions in the context of the user's session.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is exploited by crafting malicious content within the scan results that is then included in the generated HTML report. When a user opens the HTML report, the malicious script is executed.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to influence the scan result content, to inject malicious script into the generated HTML report. The attacker also requires a user to open the crafted report."
