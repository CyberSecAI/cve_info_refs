{
  "CVE-2008-1090": {
    "root_cause": "Microsoft Visio does not properly validate memory allocations when loading specially crafted .DXF files from disk into memory.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper memory validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a malicious .DXF file received as an email attachment",
      "Visiting a compromised or specially crafted website hosting a malicious .DXF file."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to open a specially crafted .DXF file using an affected version of Microsoft Visio. The attacker would need to either send the file as an attachment or host it on a website and trick the user into downloading and opening it.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when Visio loads a specially crafted .DXF file, which is an AutoCAD drawing file. By default, Visio does not open .DXF files directly when double-clicked. The user must explicitly choose to open such files via the 'Open' dialog, selecting 'AutoCAD Drawing' as file type."
