# ViewVC: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-29**

Multiple security issues have been reported in ViewVC, which can be
exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/viewvc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.5** |

### Background

ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control
repositories.

### Description

Multiple unspecified errors were reportedly fixed by the ViewVC
development team.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted URL to the server to
list CVS or SVN commits on "all-forbidden" files, access hidden CVSROOT
folders, and view restricted content via the revision view, the log
history, or the diff view.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ViewVC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/viewvc-1.0.5"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-04 15:34:05 UTC  ``` Some security issues have been reported in ViewVC, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions.  1) An error can be exploited to list CVS or SVN commits on "all-forbidden" files via a ViewVC query.  2) An error can be exploited to directly access hidden CVSROOT folders via custom URLs.  3) An error can be exploited to expose restricted content via the revision view, the log history, or the diff view.  The security issues are reported in versions prior to 1.0.5.  Solution: Update to version 1.0.5. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-04 15:35:12 UTC  ``` Web-apps, please bump as needed. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Benedikt Böhm (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-07 10:02:57 UTC  ``` in cvs, please stabilize ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-07 16:33:26 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Ferris McCormick (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-07 17:12:19 UTC  ``` Sparc stable.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE-2008-1292

| **Name** | CVE-2008-1292 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | ViewVC before 1.0.5 provides revision metadata without properly checking whether access was intended, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading (1) forbidden pathnames in the revision view, (2) log history that can only be reached by traversing a forbidden object, or (3) forbidden diff view path parameters. |

```
Package: viewvc
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Viewvc 1.0.5 fixes several security issues:

  * security fix: omit commits of all-forbidden files from query results
  * security fix: disallow direct URL navigation to hidden CVSROOT folder
  * security fix: strip forbidden paths from revision view
  * security fix: don't traverse log history thru forbidden locations
  * security fix: honor forbiddenness via diff view path parameters

Please mention the following CVE IDs when fixing this:

[CVE-2008-1290](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1290) - list CVS or SVN commits on "all-forbidden"
files

[CVE-2008-1291](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1291) - directly access hidden CVSROOT folders

[CVE-2008-1292](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1292) - expose restricted content via the revision
view, the log history, or the diff view

Cheers,
        Moritz

Dear David et. al,

I am affected by bug #471380 regarding the viewvc package.  I have
therefore created a patch that will help you update the debian
subdirectory for this package.  I am successfully using this patch
on my machine at www.zap.org.au.

The patch updates the quilt files in debian/patches (and drops the
04_forbidden_files as it does not seem to be needed now).  It also
installs the (new) docs subdirectory into /usr/share/doc/viewvc and
the (new) templates-contrib subdirectory into
/usr/share/doc/viewvc/examples.

Please apply this patch (or your own variant) as quickly as
possible; alternatively, could someone with Debian developer
privileges do an appropriate NMU?

Yours truly,

John Zaitseff

Subject: Intent to NMU viewvc to fix pending po-debconf l10n and security
bugs
Date: Fri, 28 Mar 2008 23:55:05 +0100
```
[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=471380;msg=15) (text/plain, inline)]

Dear Debian maintainer,

The viewvc Debian package, which you are the maintainer of, has
pending bug report(s) which include translation updates or fixes
for po-debconf, namely bug number 426876 (and maybe other similar bugs).

Even if we're still far from the release of the next Debian version,
letting such bugs sleep in the BTS  is simply lowering
the chances that your package interaction with its users may be done
in something else than the English language. It is also not
encouraging for translators.

I have the intention, as part of a more general action of the Debian
i18n Task Force to build and possibly upload a non-maintainer upload
for viewvc in order to fix this as well as all pending translations
for the debconf templates.

I will also, while doing that, package the 1.0.5 upstream version that
fixes several security issues.

Of course, an upload made by you would even be better...:-)

Such changes are always harmless, which explains why I safely consider
building NMU's for such issues even though they're obviously non critical.

The schedule for the NMU (in case it happens, that is if you agree with it
or if I don't receive any answer in 14 days) is roughly the following:

 Friday, March 28, 2008   : send this notice
 Saturday, April 12, 2008       : post a NMU announcement to debian-i18n with you
                 (maintainer) CC'ed
 Tuesday, April 22, 2008       : deadline for receiving translation updates
 Wednesday, April 23, 2008       : build the package and upload it to DELAYED/2-day
                 send the NMU patch to the BTS
 Friday, April 25, 2008       : NMU reaches incoming

If you intent to upload yourself, please notify me so that I interrupt
the process on my side.

In case I upload an NMU, I will subscribe to the Package Tracking System for
viewvc and follow its life for 60 days after my NMU in order to fix
any issue potentially introduced by my upload.

Let me know, as soon as possible, if you have any kind of objection to this
process.

If you'd rather do the fix yourself, I will of course leave the package
alone. Same if you have reasons not to do the update now.
