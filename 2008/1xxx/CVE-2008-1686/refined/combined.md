All users with Speex handling enabled should upgrade.   Wed Feb 7 2007 -- Version 0.9.2New in this release  * ALSA is now the default driver. see README.OSS for oss * minimum supported gtk version raised to 2.4 * added the "hand tool" for panning the display with inertia   (Radoslaw Korzeniewski) * can now open multiple files via the gtk file selector * implemented accel editing via the usual gtk method * added tdb lock override (Takashi Iwai) * remove support for libsndfile0 (Erik de Castro Lopo) * remove direct flac support as it's supported by libsndfile now   (Erik de Castro Lopo) * added a new splash screen (Pascal Klein) * fix segfault when closing windows while others were still loading * other bugs addressed and changes made. run "svn log" on a copy of svn   trunk for details, or check the [timeline](http://trac.metadecks.org/timeline)   Tue Jan 31 2006 -- Version 0.9.1New in this release This is a maintainance release.  The previous release (0.9.0) had a bug that prevented sweep from populating the ALSA devices in settings. The bug was only apparent when you built with ALSA and didn't have a previous installation of sweep that used ALSA.  If you installed sweep 0.9.0 and had problems getting any sound output then please upgrade to 0.9.1.  Wed Jan 18 2006 -- Version 0.9.0New in this release This release is the first in a new unstable series. Changes include:  * sweep now uses gtk2 for it's interface* improved mp3 detection and loading* a new SVG icon for sweep (Alex Kloss)* corrected a note to key mapping for pc keyboard playback (Paul Brossier)* an updated Spanish translation (Waldo Ramirez Montano)* an updated Polish translation (Radoslaw Korzeniewski)* more minor tweaks and improvements.  Release plans This first release based on gtk2 begins what we hope will be a short lived unstable series, leading up to the stable 1.0 release. The priority will be ensuring that the gtk2 port really is complete and bug free, but it's likely that a few important or useful new features will be squeezed in. Hopefully including:  * jack support* simple file loading via drag and drop* some form of LADSPA plugin browser (with bookmarks, search etc)* modular drivers (no more hardcoded default)   When 1.0 is released, work will begin on what will become sweep 2.0. this will be based around Conrad's libremix library and will enable sweep to perform on disk editing (removing the need to load entire files into memory), non destructive editing and much more besides. Development news The only significant change over 0.8.4 comes from the use of gtk2 for the interface. as such, you will now need gtk-2.0 (version 2.2.0 or greater) and it's dependencies to use sweep and the associated development packages to build sweep 0.9.0 from source.  See [here](http://www.metadecks.org/software/sweep/development.html) for information on accessing or contributing to sweep's development code.  You can find a nice overview of recent changes or report bugs [here](http://trac.metadecks.org/sweep/).  And of course, drop by our irc channel #sweep on irc.freenode.net and you can talk to us directly.  Mon Aug 22 2005 -- Version 0.8.4New in this release This is maintainance release, including:  * updates for ALSA 1.0 (Daniel Dreschers, Charles Turner),* a new Polish translation (Radoslaw Korzeniewski),* an updated russian translation (Alex Prokoudine),* a small fix to the German translation, and* various minor tweaks and improvements.  Release plans This is likely to be the last Sweep release based on GTK+-1.2. Further development will use GTK+-2.0 for the interface. Over the last year, Peter Shorthose has developed a comprehensive set of GTK+-2.0 patches for Sweep, and will handle their merging and ongoing release management towards Sweep 1.0. Welcome Peter!Development news The trunk of sweep CVS has been migrated to a new Subversion repository. See the [development](development.html) pages for details.  Fri Apr 30 2004 -- Version 0.8.3New in this release This is a maintainance release, including a new Spanish translation, various bugfixes and no new functionality. Sweep has moved back into CVS at SourceForge. Five new developers have been added to the project: Yuri Bongiorno, Erik de Castro Lopo, Torben Hohn, Andrï¿½ Pang, and Alexandre Prokoudine. Internationalization (i18n) improvements  * a new Spanish translation by Juan Manuel Martinez* an updated Italian translation by Yuri Bongiorno  Bugfixes  * resampler bug fixed by Erik de Castro Lopo* made main scrollbar arrows useful (bug #821596)* seven other bug reports closed* compile warning fixes for GCC3   The dependency on libtdb has been removed. TDB sources are now pulled directly from the upstream Samba subversion repository.  Wed Apr 30 2003 -- Version 0.8.2New in this release This release contains support for ALSA 0.9; this is configurable and could do with widespread testing. To build with ALSA support, simply configure with: ./configure --enable-alsa  Note that this will build a binary which will work with ALSA only, and not attempt to use OSS. In future this will be replaced with plugins for different pcm i/o methods, which should ease binary distribution. Internationalization (i18n) improvements  * a complete audit of untranslateable strings, including   mis-configured source files and unmarked strings, by   Silvia Pfeiffer.* a new Greek translation by Dokianakis Fanis* a new Russian translation by Alexandre Prokoudine* an updated Italian translation by Yuri Bongiorno* an updated German translation by Silvia Pfeiffer   There is a new mailing list: sweep-i18n. List information is [here](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sweep-i18n). Additional changes  * added VBR without DTX option for Speex 1.0 speech encoding* improved accuracy of sliders in processing dialogs   Events Conrad will presenting and demoing Sweep at the following upcoming events: | Jul 10-13 | [LinuxTag 2003](http://www.linuxtag.org/) (Karlsruhe, Germany) Conference and Linux Audio Dev (LAD) exhibition booth | | --- | --- | | Jul 31 - Aug 3 | [UKUUG Linux Developers Conference](http://www.ukuug.org/events/linux2003/) (Edinburgh, Scotland) |   Plus, the Call for Participation for the [Linux Audio Mini-Conf @ LCA2004](http://www.metadecks.org/events/lca2004/) (Jan 12-13 2004, Adelaide, South Australia) is announced [at metadecks.org](http://www.metadecks.org/events/lca2004/).

This contains all the features listed in earlier news items, and fixes a configuration error in version 0.1.0. See the [Release Notes](release_notes/0.1.1) for more information.   Mon Sep 25 2000Random updates to sweep in CVS over the last month include [LADSPA](http://ladspa.org/) support and a change in colours. Over the weekend I used sweep (in conjunction with [aube(/metadecks)](http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/aube/)) to make some sounds for Gnome desktop events. You can grab them from [here](http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/sounds/gnome-audio/).   Tue Aug 22 2000I've populated the CVS repository at sourceforge, check [here](http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=4854) for details. I've been working on a plugin infrastructure recently. The aim is to make plugins as simple to write as possible. Dialogs for setting parameters are generated on the fly by sweep, and various kinds of parameter types and constraints are available. The code is in CVS, and more details are in [this message](http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/3203/0/4232157/) on sweep-devel.   Fri May 19 2000[ASCII Corp](http://www.ascii.co.jp/) of Japan will be including Sweep 0.0.9 in their "COOL Software for Linux" bundle with *TECH Linux*, a Linux Magazine for Japanese Linux Gamers.

## Details

Alin Rad Pop discovered an array index vulnerability in the SDP

parser. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

malicious RTSP stream, a remote attacker may be able to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2008-0073](/security/CVE-2008-0073))

Luigi Auriemma discovered that xine-lib did not properly check

buffer sizes in the RTSP header-handling code. If xine-lib opened an

RTSP stream with crafted SDP attributes, a remote attacker may be

able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-0225](/security/CVE-2008-0225), [CVE-2008-0238](/security/CVE-2008-0238))

Damian Frizza and Alfredo Ortega discovered that xine-lib did not

properly validate FLAC tags. If a user or automated system were

tricked into opening a crafted FLAC file, a remote attacker may be

able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-0486](/security/CVE-2008-0486))

It was discovered that the ASF demuxer in xine-lib did not properly

check the length if the ASF header. If a user or automated system

were tricked into opening a crafted ASF file, a remote attacker

could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1110](/security/CVE-2008-1110))

It was discovered that the Matroska demuxer in xine-lib did not

properly verify frame sizes. If xine-lib opened a crafted ASF file,

a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2008-1161](/security/CVE-2008-1161))

Luigi Auriemma discovered multiple integer overflows in xine-lib. If

a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted FLV,

MOV, RM, MVE, MKV or CAK file, a remote attacker may be able to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2008-1482](/security/CVE-2008-1482))

It was discovered that xine-lib did not properly validate its input

when processing Speex file headers. If a user or automated system

were tricked into opening a specially crafted Speex file, an

attacker could create a denial of service or possibly execute

arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1686](/security/CVE-2008-1686))

Guido Landi discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in xine-lib

when processing NSF files. If xine-lib opened a specially crafted

NSF file with a long NSF title, an attacker could create a denial of

service or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2008-1878](/security/CVE-2008-1878))

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- xine NSF buffer overflow
Specially crafted NSF files could potentially be exploited to
execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-1878).
Specially crafted files or streams could potentially be abused to
trick applications that support speex into executing arbitrary code
(CVE-2008-1686).
Updated packages have been released for all SUSE distributions
containing XINE.
- xemacs and emacs fast-lock file problems
Emacs and Xemacs automatically loaded fast-lock files which allowed
local attackers to execute arbitrary code as the user editing the
associated files (CVE-2008-2142).
Xemacs and Emacs have been updated on all SUSE distributions.
- opensuse-updater tmp problems and off-by-one problems
The opensuse-updater on openSUSE 10.2 was updated to fix a symlink
problem and two off-by-one vulnerabilities.
The overflows can be considered no security problem and are tracked
by CVE-2008-2388.
The symlink flaw could be used by local users to gain unauthorized
access to information (like passwords) and is tracked by
CVE-2008-2389.
Only openSUSE 10.2 was affected by this problem.
- libvorbis security problems
Several security problems were fixed in libvorbis:
CVE-2008-1419 - Division by zero
CVE-2008-1420 - integer overflow
CVE-2008-1423 - integer overflow
libvorbis was updated on all SUSE distributions.
- xine sdpplin\_parse overflow
Xine was updated to fix a bug in the function sdpplin\_parse()
that allowed remote attackers to access process memory out-of a
buffers bound.
This vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary code remotely
if successfully exploited. (CVE-2008-0073)
Xine was updated on all SUSE distributions.
- vorbis-tools speex code execution problem
Specially crafted files or streams could potentially be abused to
trick applications that support speex into executing arbitrary code
(CVE-2008-1686) using vorbis-tools.
vorbis-tools was fixed on all SUSE distributions.
- pdns-recursor spoofing problems
Pdns-recursor was prone to a spoofing vulnerability which could be
abused to redirect clients or manipulate data. (CVE-2008-1637)
pdns / pdns-recursor is shipped on SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2
and 10.3 and was fixed there.
- openwsman post-auth remote code execution
Openwsman was updated to provide a fix for the included shttpd
web-server to patch a buffer overflow vulnerability in the HTTP
request parser.
This bug can only be exploited by authenticated users to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the openwsman/shttp
daemon. (CVE-2008-2097)
Only openSUSE 10.3 contains openwsman and was fixed.

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- Linux kernel update
We are currently preparing a kernel update for all products to catch up on security
problems and bugs found in the last months.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Speex: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code â GLSA **200804-17**

Improper input validation in Speex might lead to array indexing
vulnerabilities in multiple player applications.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/speex** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2\_beta3\_p2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2\_beta3\_p2** |

### Background

Speex is an audio compression format designed for speech that is free
of patent restrictions.

### Description

oCERT reported that the Speex library does not properly validate the
"mode" value it derives from Speex streams, allowing for array indexing
vulnerabilities inside multiple player applications. Within Gentoo,
xine-lib, VLC, gst-plugins-speex from the GStreamer Good Plug-ins,
vorbis-tools, libfishsound, Sweep, SDL\_sound, and speexdec were found
to be vulnerable.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted Speex
file or network stream with an application listed above. This might
lead to the execution of arbitrary code with privileges of the user
playing the file.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Speex users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/speex-1.2_beta3_p2"
```

This is an update for use with python-2.1  It can be tested by starting a python shell (need a PPM image viewer installed: tkinter will suffice) and >>>from NumTut import * >>>view(greece)  should see a pretty picture.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:05:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10](attachment.cgi?id=10 "Numeric-20.3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=10&action=edit "Numeric-20.3.ebuild")] Numeric-20.3.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:06:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 11](attachment.cgi?id=11 "Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=11&action=edit "Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff")] Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 21:17:27 UTC  ``` This ebuild gives a Access violtion when run through the sandbox.  --------------------------- ACCESS VIOLATION SUMMARY ---------------------------LOG FILE = "/tmp/sandbox-Numeric-20.3-15709.log"  unlink:    /usr/lib/python2.1/distutils/command/install_headers.pyc open_wr:   /usr/lib/python2.1/distutils/command/install_headers.pyc -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-05 03:51:53 UTC  ``` The sandbox violation seems to be python version related.  I don't get a violation building against python-2.2. I even doubted that sandbox was working so I added a 'echo "fail" > /home/tod/tmp/fail.test' to the ebuild install function, and it then generated a access violation (sandbox is nice!).    Bottom line.  The simple fix seems to be change the depends to >=python-2.2 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-10 07:34:59 UTC  ``` added dep on >=python 2.2   ``` |  |

## Details

USN-611-1 fixed a vulnerability in Speex. This update provides the

corresponding update for ogg123, part of vorbis-tools.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that Speex did not properly validate its input when

processing Speex file headers. If a user or automated system were

tricked into opening a specially crafted Speex file, an attacker could

create a denial of service in applications linked against Speex or

possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

**oCERT-2008-004 multiple speex implementations insufficient boundary checks**

**Description**:

The reference speex decoder from the [Speex library](http://speex.org)
performs insufficient boundary checks on a header structure read from user input, this
has been reported in [oCERT-2008-002](ocert-2008-002.html)
advisory.

Further investigation showed that several packages include similar code and
are therefore vulnerable.

In order to prevent the usage of incorrect header processing reference code,
the speex\_packet\_to\_header() function has been modified to bound the returned mode
values in Speex >= 1.2beta3.2. This change automatically fixes applications that
use the Speex library dynamically.

**Affected version**:

[gstreamer-plugins-good](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/gst-plugins-good.html) <= 0.10.7

[SDL\_sound](http://icculus.org/SDL_sound) <= 1.0.1

[Speex](http://www.speex.org) <= 1.1.12 (speexdec)

[Sweep](http://www.metadecks.org/software/sweep) <= 0.9.2

[vorbis-tools](http://xiph.org) <= 1.2.0

[VLC Media Player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc) <= 0.8.6f

[xine-lib](http://xinehq.de) <= 1.11.1.1

XMMS speex plugin

**Fixed version**:

[gstreamer-plugins-good](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/gst-plugins-good.html) >= 0.10.8 (patched in CVS)

[SDL\_sound](http://icculus.org/SDL_sound) >= 1.0.2

[Speex](http://www.speex.org) >= 1.2beta3.2 (patched in CVS)

[Sweep](http://www.metadecks.org/software/sweep) >= 0.9.3

[vorbis-tools](http://xiph.org), patched in CVS

[VLC Media Player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc), patched in GIT

[xine-lib](http://xinehq.de) >= 1.1.12

XMMS speex plugin, N/A

**Credit**: see [oCERT-2008-002](ocert-2008-002.html),
additionally we would like to thank Tomas Hoger from the Red Hat Security Response Team for his help
in investigating the issue.

**CVE**: [CVE-2008-1686](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1686)

**Timeline**:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

An overflow was found in the Speex decoder that could lead to a crash or possible execution of arbitrary code.   Xine-lib <= 1.1.12 was also found to be vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow in the NES demuxer (thanks to milw0rm.com).  More details about the first issue may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1686   Here are the details from the Slackware 12.0 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/xine-lib-1.1.11.1-i686-3_slack12.0.tgz:   Recompiled, with --without-speex (we didn't ship the speex library in   Slackware anyway, but for reference this issue would be CVE-2008-1686),   and with --disable-nosefart (the recently reported as insecurely   demuxed NSF format).  As before in -2, this package fixes the two   regressions mentioned in the release notes for xine-lib-1.1.12:     http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=592185&group_id=9655   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com? Give slackware.osuosl.org a try.  This is another primary FTP site for Slackware that can be considerably faster than downloading directly from ftp.slackware.com.  Thanks to the friendly folks at the OSU Open Source Lab (http://osuosl.org) for donating additional FTP and rsync hosting to the Slackware project!  :-)  Also see the "Get Slack" section on http://slackware.com for additional mirror sites near you.

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in xine-lib, a library
which supplies most of the application functionality of the xine
multimedia player.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following three problems:

CVE-2008-1482

    Integer overflow vulnerabilities exist in xine's FLV, QuickTime,
    RealMedia, MVE and CAK demuxers, as well as the EBML parser used
    by the Matroska demuxer.  These weaknesses allow an attacker to
    overflow heap buffers and potentially execute arbitrary code by
    supplying a maliciously crafted file of those types.

CVE-2008-1686

    Insufficient input validation in the Speex implementation used
    by this version of xine enables an invalid array access and the
    execution of arbitrary code by supplying a maliciously crafted
    Speex file.

CVE-2008-1878

    Inadequate bounds checking in the NES Sound Format (NSF) demuxer
    enables a stack buffer overflow and the execution of arbitrary
    code through a maliciously crafted NSF file.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.12-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your xine-lib packages.

Vulnerability  : integer overflow
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1686
Debian Bug     : 475152

It was discovered that libfishsound, a simple programming interface that
wraps Xiph.Org audio codecs, didn't correctly handle negative values in
a particular header field.  This could allow malicious files to execute
arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.7.0-2etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.0-2.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libfishsound package.

# USN-611-1: Speex vulnerability

8 May 2008

Speex vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [speex](/security/cves?package=speex) -

## Details

It was discovered that Speex did not properly validate its input when

processing Speex file headers. If a user or automated system were

tricked into opening a specially crafted Speex file, an attacker could

create a denial of service in applications linked against Speex or

possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

FishSound 0.9.1 Release
-----------------------

libfishsound provides a simple programming interface for decoding and
encoding audio data using Xiph.Org codecs (FLAC, Speex and Vorbis).

This release is available as a source tarball at:

<http://www.annodex.net/software/libfishsound/download/libfishsound-0.9.1.tar.gz>

New in this release
-------------------

This is a maintenance release, containing the following changes:

    * Fixed bounds checking of mode in Speex header (merged from speexdec)
    * Updated Visual Studio solution file with recently added sources and
      headers (arke)
    * Updated FLAC configure checking and testing
    * Support for automake 1.10 and other build cleanups (johnf)

About libfishsound
------------------

libfishsound by itself is designed to handle raw codec streams from a
lower level layer such as UDP datagrams. When these codecs are used in
files, they are commonly encapsulated in Ogg to produce Ogg FLAC, SPeex
and Ogg Vorbis files.

libfishsound is a wrapper around the existing codec libraries and provides
a consistent, higher-level programming interface. It has been designed for
use in a wide variety of applications; it has no direct dependencies on
Ogg encapsulation, though it is most commonly used in conjunction with
liboggz to decode or encode FLAC, Speex or Vorbis audio tracks in Ogg files,
including Ogg Theora and Annodex.

FishSound has been developed and tested on GNU/Linux, Darwin/MacOSX and
Win32. It probably also works on other Unix-like systems via GNU autoconf.
For Win32: nmake Makefiles, Visual Studio .NET 2003 solution files and
Visual C++ 6.0 workspace files are all provided in the source distribution.

Full documentation of the FishSound API, customization and installation,
and complete examples of Ogg FLAC, Speex and Ogg Vorbis decoding and
encoding are provided in the source tarball, and can be read online
at:

    <http://www.annodex.net/software/libfishsound/html/>

FishSound is Free Software, available under a BSD-style license.

More information is available online at the FishSound homepage:

    <http://www.annodex.net/software/libfishsound/>

enjoy :)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
