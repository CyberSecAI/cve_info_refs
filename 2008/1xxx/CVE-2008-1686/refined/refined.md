{
  "CVE-2008-1686": {
    "Description": "It was discovered that Speex did not properly validate its input when processing Speex file headers. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted Speex file, an attacker could create a denial of service in applications linked against Speex or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input validation in the Speex library when processing Speex file headers.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Insufficient boundary checks on a header structure read from user input.",
      "An array index vulnerability due to improper validation of the 'mode' value derived from Speex streams.",
       "Integer overflow in a header field.",
      "Negative offsets in a header field not correctly handled."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted Speex file or network stream with a vulnerable application, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user playing the file, or a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Opening a crafted Speex file.",
      "Opening a malicious RTSP stream.",
      "Opening an RTSP stream with crafted SDP attributes.",
      "Opening a specially crafted Speex file or network stream.",
       "Crafted FLAC file.",
       "Specially crafted files or streams."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted speex file or stream to the user. They can be a remote attacker."
