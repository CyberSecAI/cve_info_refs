 CVE-2008-1340
##### 1. Summary

Several critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed in the newest releases of VMware's hosted product line.

#####

##### 2. Relevant releases

VMware Workstation 6.0.2 and earlier
VMware Workstation 5.5.4 and earlier
VMware Player 2.0.2 and earlier
VMware Player 1.0.4 and earlier
VMware ACE 2.0.2 and earlier
VMware ACE 1.0.2 and earlier
VMware Server 1.0.4 and earlier
VMware Fusion 1.1.1 and earlier

##### 3. Problem description

a. Host to guest shared folder (HGFS) traversal vulnerability
On Windows hosts, if you have configured a VMware host to guest shared folder (HGFS), it is possible for a program running in the guest to gain access to the host's file system and create or modify executable files in sensitive locations.

NOTE: VMware Server is not affected because it doesn't use host to guest shared folders. No versions of ESX Server, including ESX Server 3i, are affected by this vulnerability. Because ESX Server is based on a bare-metal hypervisor architecture and not a hosted architecture, and it doesn't include any shared folder abilities. Fusion and Linux based hosted products are unaffected.

VMware would like to thank CORE Security Technologies for working with us on this issue. This addresses advisory CORE-2007-0930.

The Common Vulnerabilities and exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-0923 to this issue.

#####

b. Insecure named pipes
An internal security audit determined that a malicious Windows user could attain and exploit LocalSystem privileges by causing the authd process to connect to a named pipe that is opened and controlled by the malicious user.

The same internal security audit determined that a malicious Windows user could exploit an insecurely created named pipe object to escalate privileges or create a denial of service attack. In this situation, the malicious user could successfully impersonate authd and attain privileges under which Authd is executing.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2008-1361, CVE-2008-1362 to these issues.

#####

c. Updated libpng library to version 1.2.22 to address various security vulnerabilities
Several flaws were discovered in the way libpng handled various PNG image chunks. An attacker could create a carefully crafted PNG image file in such a way that it could cause an application linked with libpng to crash when the file was manipulated.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-5269 to this issue.

#####

e. VIX API default setting changed to a more secure default value
Workstation 6.0.2 allowed anonymous console access to the guest by means of the VIX API. This release, Workstation 6.0.3, disables this feature.

This means that the Eclipse Integrated Virtual Debugger and the Visual Studio Integrated Virtual Debugger will now prompt for user account credentials to access a guest.

#####

f. Windows 2000 based hosted products privilege escalation vulnerability
This release addresses a potential privilege escalation on Windows 2000 hosted products. Certain services may be improperly registered and present a security vulnerability to Windows 2000 machines.

VMware would like to thank Ray Hicken for reporting this issue and David Maciejak for originally pointing out these types of vulnerabilities.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-5618 to this issue.

#####

h. Local Privilege Escalation on Windows based platforms by Hijacking VMware VMX configuration file
VMware uses a configuration file named "config.ini" which is located in the application data directory of all users.

By manipulating this file, a user could gain elevated privileges by hijacking the VMware VMX process.

VMware would like to thank Sun Bing for reporting the issue.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-1363 to this issue.

#####

i. Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) memory corruption resulting in denial of service
VMCI was introduced in VMware Workstation 6.0, VMware Player 2.0, and VMware ACE 2.0. It is an experimental, optional feature and it may be possible to crash the host system by making specially crafted calls to the VMCI interface. This may result in denial of service via memory exhaustion and memory corruption.

VMware would like to thank Andrew Honig of the Department of Defense for reporting this issue.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-1340 to this issue.

# VMware Player, Server, Workstation: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation, allowing remote and local attackers to conduct several
attacks, including privilege escalation, remote execution of arbitrary
code, and a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-player** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-workstation** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **6.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-server** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0.9.156507** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

VMware Player, Server, and Workstation allow emulation of a complete PC
on a PC without the usual performance overhead of most emulators.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

Local users may be able to gain escalated privileges, cause a Denial of
Service, or gain sensitive information.

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code, or a Denial
of Service. Remote attackers also may be able to spoof DNS traffic, read
arbitrary files, or inject arbitrary web script to the VMware Server
Console.

Furthermore, guest OS users may be able to execute arbitrary code on the
host OS, gain escalated privileges on the guest OS, or cause a Denial of
Service (crash the host OS).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Player. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Player:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-player"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
“>=app-emulation/vmware-player-3.1.5”, however these packages are
not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Workstation. We recommend that
users unmerge VMware Workstation:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-workstation"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
“>=app-emulation/vmware-workstation-7.1.5”, however these packages
are not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Server. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Server:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-server"

```
