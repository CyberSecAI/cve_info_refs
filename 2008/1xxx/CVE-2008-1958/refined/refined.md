Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `news.php` file of TR News version 2.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `nb` parameter of the `news.php` script, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. The provided example demonstrates how to retrieve user credentials (username, password, email) from the `tr_user_news` table.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** By gaining access to user credentials, an attacker can potentially gain access to the administrative interface. The content mentions that a shell can be uploaded using the admin panel, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to `news.php` with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `nb` parameter.
*   **Publicly Accessible Web Application:** The vulnerable `news.php` file is part of a web application, making it accessible to remote attackers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through a web browser.
*   **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL injection techniques to construct the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit information also provides a method to upload a shell via the admin panel, illustrating another attack vector.
*   The exploit was originally published on milw0rm.com on April 21, 2008.
*   A "dork" is provided to help identify vulnerable instances of TR News 2.1 on the internet: `inurl:news.php?mode=voir`
