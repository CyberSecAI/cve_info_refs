How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the

* **001: SECURITY FIX: October 8, 2007**
    *All architectures*

  Malicious DHCP clients could cause dhcpd(8) to corrupt its stack

  A DHCP client that claimed to require a maximum message size less than
  the minimum IP MTU could cause dhcpd(8) to overwrite stack memory.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/001_dhcpd.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: October 10, 2007**
      *All architectures*

    The SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function in OpenSSL contains an off-by-one overflow.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/002_openssl.patch)

    * **003: CD BOOT FAILURE ON OLDER COMPUTERS : October 30, 2007**
        *i386 only*

      Some older BIOSes are unable to boot CD1 (ie. the commercial release sold
      by the project, not the CD images available on the net).
      A workaround using CD2 (amd64 architecture) is as follows.
      (An amd64 machine is *NOT* required for this to work.)

      1. Insert CD2 and tell your computer to boot it;
         * When the `boot>` prompt appears, stop the automatic boot
           by pressing the space bar;
           * Remove CD2 and insert CD1;
             * Erase the character you typed to stop the boot, type

               `boot /4.2/i386/bsd.rd`

               then press *Enter*.

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: November 27, 2007**
          *All architectures*

        A memory leak in pf can lead to machine lockups.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/004_pf.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: January 11, 2008**
            *All architectures*

          A missing NULL pointer check can lead to a kernel panic.

              *All architectures*

                    execute arbitrary commands. This behaviour was documented, but was an unsafe
                    default and an extra hassle for administrators.

                          A vulnerability has been found with BIND. An attacker could use this vulnerability
                          to poison the cache of a recursive resolving name server.

                              *All architectures*

                            Some kinds of IPv6 usage would leak kernel memory (in particular, this path
                            was exercised by the named(8) patch for port randomization). Since INET6 is
                            enabled by default, this condition affects all systems.

                                *All architectures*

                              The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ndp) did not correctly verify neighbor
                              solicitation requests maybe allowing a nearby attacker to intercept traffic.
                              The attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for
                              this vulnerability to be exploited.
