  "cve": "CVE-2008-1057",
  "source": "www.openbsd.org_e44b99c5_20250125_134053.html",
  "description": "The provided content from OpenBSD errata indicates that this CVE is related to a vulnerability in OpenBSD's Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ndp). This vulnerability allows a nearby attacker to potentially intercept traffic by exploiting a lack of proper verification of neighbor solicitation requests in the ndp implementation.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ndp) did not correctly verify neighbor solicitation requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of neighbor solicitation requests."
    ],
    "impact": "A nearby attacker with IPv6 connectivity to the same router as the target could intercept traffic.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network, specifically exploiting IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ndp)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network segment and have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as the target."
  }
