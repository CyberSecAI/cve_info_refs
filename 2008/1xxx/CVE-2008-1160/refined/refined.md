{
  "CVE-2008-1160": {
    "description": "The vulnerability in the Quagga/Zebra routing daemon exists because the appliance fails to change the password needed to log into the Quagga/Zebra daemon running on ports 2601, 2602 (Quagga/RIP) & 2604 (Quagga/OSPF) /TCP. Even though the appliance's password has been changed, an attacker can still use the default password 'zebra' to log into the Quagga/Zebra service to view and manipulate the routing information, etc. of the appliance.",
    "root_cause": "The Quagga/Zebra routing daemon's default password is not changed when the appliance's password is changed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of hard-coded default password",
      "Failure to update service credentials after a password change"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the Quagga/Zebra service, allowing them to view and manipulate the routing information of the appliance.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the exposed ports (2601, 2602, 2604/TCP)"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the device and knowledge of the default password 'zebra'. No prior authentication with the appliance itself is required.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability was discovered on a ZyWall 1050 appliance, but other versions could be affected. The vulnerability allows remote code execution."
