Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1111:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from lighttpd's behavior when it fails to fork a CGI process, usually due to resource limits. Instead of returning an error, it discloses the source code of the CGI script to the client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the disclosure of sensitive information, specifically the source code of CGI scripts.
- **Improper Error Handling:** lighttpd fails to properly handle the `fork()` system call failure, leading to the source code disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Source Code Exposure:** Attackers can gain access to the source code of CGI scripts, which may contain sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, or other application logic.
- **Increased Attack Surface:** The exposed source code can be used to discover other potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending requests to execute a CGI script on a vulnerable server.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** An attacker might try to intentionally exhaust server resources (e.g. hitting ulimit) to trigger the failure of the fork system call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the targeted lighttpd server.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of how HTTP requests work to access a cgi-script.
- **No authentication:** No prior authentication or special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The Gentoo bug report indicates that the default configuration of lighttpd in Gentoo was not vulnerable out of the box because mod_cgi was not included by default. The vulnerability was only present if mod_cgi.conf was included in the lighttpd configuration.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves lighttpd returning a 500 error instead of the source code of the CGI script upon failure.
- Debian also released an advisory for this vulnerability, stating the issue was fixed in version 1.4.13-4etch5.
- openSUSE also listed this vulnerability as one of the fixed issues in their security summary report.

In summary, CVE-2008-1111 is a remote information disclosure vulnerability in lighttpd, caused by improper error handling when executing CGI scripts, where the server reveals the script's source code instead of returning a 500 error when forking fails.
