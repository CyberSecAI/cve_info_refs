```
<!--
The problem is in wkimgsrv.dll module shipped with many MS Offiice
Suite (tested on MS OF 2003,MS OF 2007)
Actually,this is not the case of buffer overflow attack,just a exploit
of insecure method WKsPictureInterface.
Setting this point to any where in memory and IE will crash when
wkiimgsrv's trying to access an invalid memory location.

Let's get into detail :

00D473BD              PUSH EBP                                 ;
Begin of Set WksPictureInterface method
00D473BE   	 MOV EBP,ESP
00D473C0              SUB ESP,1C
00D473C3  	MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+C]   ;  Move paramater to EAX
00D473C6  	PUSH ESI
00D473C7 	TEST EAX,EAX                             ;  Checking whether
EAX is NULL
00D473C9 	JNZ SHORT wkimgsrv.00D473D5    ;  OK,if it is not null continue
00D473CB  	MOV EAX,80004005	        ;
00D473D0  	JMP wkimgsrv.00D47456               ;No,it's is NULL,exit method
00D473D5  ==>	MOV ESI,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8] ; Do some other stuffs, we don't care
00D473D8  	LEA EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-1C] ;
00D473DB  	PUSH EDX
00D473DC 	PUSH EAX
00D473DD 	MOV DWORD PTR DS:[ESI+2A0],EAX        ; =============
00D473E3   ==>	MOV ECX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX]              ; Here is the
problem,the data stored by EAX is referenced and moved into ECX
00D473E5 	CALL DWORD PTR DS:[ECX+30]               ;Next the address
in some struct pointed by ECX is called

Now if we're able to setup memory satisfied :
Create a struct in memory where the first DWORD in the struct point to
itself and the DWORD at offset 0x30 from struct address is point to
our shellcode.
We should be able to exploit this vulnerability.
This seem to be nightmare because there is nothing to inject except an
integer as paramater for the method.
Fortunately we have prefered heapspray method
Howerver we can't spray with nop (0x90 ) anymore(if this happens, all
address will be 90909090 which is invalid address) ,
The addresses and byte to spray must comply some restrictions
- Byte to spray must be single byte length instruction (or somewhat
that not change execution of the program or causing exception)
- Combination of 4 byte must refer to valid memory address which will
point to it self.

I have chosen 0x0A to spay on IE 7, and 0x05 to spay on IE 6. In
Internet Explorer 7 the number passes to method is 168430090 which is
0x0A0A0A0A in
hexa mode.Let's assume that we has fill 0x0A into memory at
0x0A0A0A0A. EAX will hold value of 0x0A0A0A0A.
Mov ECX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX]  ;=> ECX= 0x0A0A0A0A
CALL DWORD DTR DS:[ECX+30] ;=> CALL DWORD DTR:[0x0A0A0A3A] => CALL 0x0A0A0A0A
Memory at 0x0A0A0A0A is filled with 0x0A ~ instruction is OR CL,BYTE
PTR DS:[EDX]
Fortunately this hadn't caused exception and not changed execution
path of our shellcode

Shellcode should be executed as expected(calc will be opened).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
