# VLC: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-13**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC, allowing for the execution of
arbitrary code and Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/vlc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.6e** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.6e** |

### Background

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC:

* Michal Luczaj
  and Luigi Auriemma reported that VLC contains boundary errors when
  handling subtitles in the ParseMicroDvd(), ParseSSA(), and
  ParseVplayer() functions in the modules/demux/subtitle.c file, allowing
  for a stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-6681).
* The web
  interface listening on port 8080/tcp contains a format string error in
  the httpd\_FileCallBack() function in the network/httpd.c file
  (CVE-2007-6682).
* The browser plugin possibly contains an
  argument injection vulnerability (CVE-2007-6683).
* The RSTP
  module triggers a NULL pointer dereference when processing a request
  without a "Transport" parameter (CVE-2007-6684).
* Luigi
  Auriemma and Remi Denis-Courmont found a boundary error in the
  modules/access/rtsp/real\_sdpplin.c file when processing SDP data for
  RTSP sessions (CVE-2008-0295) and a vulnerability in the
  libaccess\_realrtsp plugin (CVE-2008-0296), possibly resulting in a
  heap-based buffer overflow.
* Felipe Manzano and Anibal Sacco
  (Core Security Technologies) discovered an arbitrary memory overwrite
  vulnerability in VLC's MPEG-4 file format parser (CVE-2008-0984).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a long subtitle in a file that a user is
enticed to open, a specially crafted MP4 input file, long SDP data, or
a specially crafted HTTP request with a "Connection" header value
containing format specifiers, possibly resulting in the remote
execution of arbitrary code. Also, a Denial of Service could be caused
and arbitrary files could be overwritten via the "demuxdump-file"
option in a filename in a playlist or via an EXTVLCOPT statement in an
MP3 file.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.8.6e"
```

# VLC: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200804-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC, allowing for the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/vlc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.6f** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.6f** |

### Background

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC:

* Luigi Auriemma discovered that the stack-based buffer overflow when
  reading subtitles, which has been reported as CVE-2007-6681 in GLSA
  200803-13, was not properly fixed (CVE-2008-1881).
* Alin Rad Pop of Secunia reported an array indexing vulnerability in the
  sdpplin\_parse() function when processing streams from RTSP servers in
  Xine code, which is also used in VLC (CVE-2008-0073).
* Drew Yao and Nico Golde reported an integer overflow in the
  MP4\_ReadBox\_rdrf() function in the file libmp4.c leading to a
  heap-based buffer overflow when reading MP4 files (CVE-2008-1489).
* Drew Yao also reported integer overflows in the MP4 demuxer,
  the Real demuxer and in the Cinepak codec, which might lead to buffer
  overflows (CVE-2008-1768).
* Drew Yao finally discovered and a
  boundary error in Cinepak, which might lead to memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-1769).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted media
file or stream, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary
code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.8.6f"
```

# Security Advisory 0803

```

Summary           : Buffer overflows in multiple modules
Date              : 13 April 2008
Affected versions : VLC media player 0.8.6e and earlier
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-0803
CVE reference     : CVE-2008-0073, CVE-2008-1489, CVE-2008-1768, CVE-2008-1769

```
## Details

VLC media player's following modules suffer from arbitrary memory overwrite vulnerabilities when using specially crafted (invalid) input streams / files:
Real RTSP and Real media demuxers, MP4 demuxer, Cinepak decoder.

## Impact

If successful, a malicious third party could trigger the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the running instance or terminate the application unexpectedly.

## Threat mitigation

Exploitation of the MP4 / Real Media demuxer or the Cinepak decoder issues requires the user to explicitly open specially crafted files or streams.

Exploitation of the Real RTSP problems requires the user to explicitly open streams provided by malicious third parties.

## Workarounds

The user is asked to open Real RTSP / Real Media streams and MP4 files as well as files containing Cinepak video streams from trusted content providers only. In case of uncertainess, it is recommended not to open this kind of streams or files. RTSP streams can easily be identified by the `rtsp` prefix of their URL/MRL, while the MP4 container file type is recognizable by the `mp4` suffix. Cinepak encoded video streams are usually found in MOV and MP4 container files only, which may be perceived by their `mp4` and `mov` suffixes. Real Media files usually include `ram`, `ra` or `rm` suffixes.

## Solution

VLC media player 0.8.6f addresses these issues and introduces further
usability fixes.

Pre-compiled packages are available at the usual download locations.

## Credits

The Real RTSP demuxer, Real media demuxer, MP4 demuxer and Cinepak codec vulnerabilities were discovered by Drew Yao of Apple Product Security.
