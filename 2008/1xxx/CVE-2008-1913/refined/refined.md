Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-1913:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `index.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is the presence of an SQL injection flaw, which enables an attacker to manipulate the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as database name, usernames, passwords, and version information.
*   **Potential for Data Manipulation:** While not explicitly mentioned in this exploit, SQL injection can often be leveraged to modify or delete database records, leading to further compromise of the application.
*   **Complete System Takeover:** Depending on the privileges of the database user being used by the web application, and any additional vulnerabilities, it may be possible for an attacker to achieve a complete takeover of the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` script with a malicious value for the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker does not require any prior authentication or privileged access to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network connectivity to the vulnerable web server.

**Specific exploit details:**
* The exploit string is provided as `http://www.xxx.org//index.php?id=new&new=-1'%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%201,2,concat(database(),char(58),user(),char(58),version()),concat(username,0x3e,password),5,6,7,8,9+from+admins/*`
* This exploit uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to append a malicious query to the original SQL query.
* The injected query retrieves the database name, user, version, username and password from the admins table
* The `admins` table is specifically targeted, but the attacker could retrieve other data by changing the query.
*  The exploit is specifically crafted for Lasernet CMS v1.5.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit information confirms that this is a remote SQL injection vulnerability and was discovered by cO2 of the Algeria Security Crew.
*   The content also provides a link to the CVE page on nvd.nist.gov for the vulnerability.
