  "CVE-2008-1084": {
    "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists due to the Windows kernel improperly validating input passed from user mode to the kernel. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to run code with elevated privileges. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
