Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-1534:

**Vulnerability:** Multiple Local File Inclusion

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `footer.inc.php` and `header.inc.php` files within the PowerPHPBoard application. Specifically, the application directly includes files specified by the `$settings[footer]` and `$settings[header]` variables without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI. Attackers can control the file path used in the `include()` function, allowing them to include and execute arbitrary local files from the server.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the values of `$settings[footer]` and `$settings[header]`, which makes it vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
*   **Reliance on `REGISTER_GLOBALS`:** The exploitability relies on the `REGISTER_GLOBALS` PHP option being enabled. This feature, while deprecated, could still be enabled in some environments, making them vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including files containing PHP code, attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use path traversal to include sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` and potentially gain access to system credentials or other sensitive information.
*   **Website Defacement:** By including malicious files, attackers can alter the content of the website, leading to defacement or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** Attackers can manipulate the `settings[footer]` and `settings[header]` variables through HTTP GET requests.
*   **Path Traversal:** Attackers can use path traversal techniques (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`) in the provided variables to include files outside the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** Attackers need to know the names of the vulnerable parameters `settings[footer]` and `settings[header]`.
*   **PHP `REGISTER_GLOBALS` Enabled:** The vulnerability is fully exploitable if the PHP configuration option `register_globals` is enabled on the target system.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in `footer.inc.php` and `header.inc.php`.
*   The vulnerable code segments are:
    ```php
        if ($settings[footer]) {
            if (file_exists("inc/$settings[footer]")) {
              include("inc/$settings[footer]");
            } else {
              echo "<center>$lang_footerdoesntexists</center>";
            }
        } else {
            include("inc/footer.ppb");
        }
    ```
    and
    ```php
         if ($settings[header]) {
            if (file_exists("inc/$settings[header]")) {
              include("inc/$settings[header]");
            } else {
              echo "<center>$lang_headerfiledoesntexists</center>";
            }
        } else {
            include("inc/header.ppb");
        }
    ```
*   Example exploit URLs:
    *   `http://[server]/[installdir]/footer.inc.php?settings[footer]=../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
    *   `http://[server]/[installdir]/header.inc.php?handler=1234&settings[header]=../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a detailed description of the vulnerability and sample exploit URLs.
*   The advisory mentions that the vendor did not respond and no solution was provided.
*   The vulnerability requires the deprecated `register_globals` PHP setting to be enabled.
