```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input passed through the 'C_ID' parameter in the URL.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can bypass authentication and potentially gain access to sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords, stored in the 'users' table.
- Attack vectors: Sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable application containing a malicious SQL query in the 'C_ID' parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
