Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application, "Affiliate Market Ver.0.1 BETA", is vulnerable to both SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  The `detail.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter. The provided exploit string demonstrates how an attacker can inject SQL code to extract admin login and password information from the database.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `sideblock.php` script is vulnerable to reflected XSS via the `sideblock4` parameter, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Allows an attacker to retrieve sensitive data, such as admin credentials (username and password), potentially gaining full control of the application.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or defacement of the website.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  The attack is performed by crafting a malicious SQL query within the `id` parameter of the `detail.php` script.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting:** The attack is performed by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `sideblock4` parameter of the `sideblock.php` script.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application. No prior authentication is required for the exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided exploit code is written in Perl and automates the process of exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
* The exploit targets the admin table to retrieve login credentials.
* The XSS attack vector is provided as a proof-of-concept.
