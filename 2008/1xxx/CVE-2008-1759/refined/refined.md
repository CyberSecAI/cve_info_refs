Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `jeuxflash` module of KwsPHP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `cat` parameter in `index.php?mod=jeuxflash` is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords (as demonstrated in the provided exploit).
- **Database Manipulation:**  It's likely that a successful SQL injection attack could also allow an attacker to modify or delete data within the database, although this is not explicitly stated in the provided exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack is carried out via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` script.
- **Malicious Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `cat`, which is used within the SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server running the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to craft SQL injection payloads, which would usually require some knowledge of the database structure and SQL syntax.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit demonstrates the vulnerability by using the following malicious URL:
```
http://server.com/Path/index.php?mod=jeuxflash&cat=-1%20union%20select%201,concat(pseudo,0x3a,pass),3%20from%20users%20where%20id=1--
```
This URL exploits the SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve the username (`pseudo`) and password (`pass`) of the first user in the `users` table. The use of `UNION SELECT` allows the attacker to inject their own SQL query into the original query, effectively reading data from tables other than the one originally intended for retrieval.

The exploit uses:
- `-1`: To ensure no original data is returned.
- `union select 1,concat(pseudo,0x3a,pass),3`: To return a specific data set concatenating username and password from the database.
- `from users where id=1`: Specifies the table and condition to retrieve the data.
- `--`: A SQL comment to terminate the rest of the original query.

This shows a classic SQL injection scenario where the attacker is able to read data directly from the database.
