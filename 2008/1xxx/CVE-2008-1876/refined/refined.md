{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses an include statement with a variable that is directly controllable by the user.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file containing malicious code which will then be executed by the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `_CONFIG[files][functions_page]` parameter in the URL, the attacker can specify a remote file to be included.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application and have access to a server hosting the malicious file."
