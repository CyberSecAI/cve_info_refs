# bzip2

The bzip2 file compression program was developed by Julian Seward and launched on the 18th of July in 1996. It has remained an open source program, available to all for free, for over twenty two years now. The last stable release was seven years ago. The version 1.0.6 was released on the 20th of September in 2010. bzip2 compression program is based on Burrows–Wheeler algorithm. The program can compress files but cannot archive them. Julian Seward is still in charge of maintaining the program. The compression application works on all major operating systems and is available as a BSD-like license. The program uses .bz2 as its filename extension, application/x-bzip2 as the media type on internet and public.archive.bzip2 as the uniform type identifier.

bzip2 is suitable for power users. The command line enabled file compression program has fifteen options. Initiating and running the program is a cakewalk. Every option is well explained. The program can be used in batch files. It cannot recover from syntax errors but it can force compression and even decompress damaged archives. There are specific options to overwrite files, to suppress errors and compel compression. The simple operation and quick decompression or extraction would suit many heavy users. As per the information published by the developer, the file compression program is capable of compressing files down to 15% or 10% of other available techniques and operates at twice the compression speed and six times the decompression speed than gzip. Although not an archiving tool, the program can extract undamaged files in disks or tapes that have errors.

The file compression program can be downloaded and installed for free. It is compatible with Windows 2000 and XP, subsequently all later versions. There are no specific requirements or additional specifications that must be satiated. The total size of the file to be downloaded is 76KB. You would use the bzip2-105-x86-win32.exe file to install. bzip2 is used by a few million people around the world. bzip2 file compression can convert almost everything that you may test it with. The simplicity and reliability of the program have earned it many laurels but there has been some criticism for its lack of archiving ability. The efficacy of the program to extract some damaged parts of files in otherwise inaccessible tapes or discs is worthwhile. This blog was created as an informational portal on bzip2. Scott Chow has [a good guide on how to start a blog](https://www.theblogstarter.com) that is suitable for beginners if you are looking to start your own blog on file compression or any other topic.

There has been no major update to the file compression program in recent years. This is partly because such updates have been unnecessary. It can still work on all popular files and can compress or decompress with utmost ease. The space you can save with files compressed using bzip2 is sufficient when you factor in heavy documents or materials. There is no premium version of the file compression program so you can bid adieu to the recurrent messages prompting you to pay up and upgrade. There is no advanced or full version. You get everything there is in the free and open source version of bzip2. In fact, there is only one version you can download and use. It has been criticized by some for having only one algorithm powering the compression.

**Comprehensive Guide to bzip2**

bzip2 became quite popular in the late nineties and the subsequent updates made it more widespread. The program is more effective than Deflate and LZW programs but is also slower. The LZW or .z and the Deflate algorithms such as .gz and .zip are less effective but they operate quickly. As a result they end up taking more space than what bzip2 can achieve. The bzip2 compression program facilitates considerably faster decompression compared to its pace of compression.

bzip2 file compression program works on data in different sizes of blocks, usually from 100 to 900 kilobytes. It relies on Burrows–Wheeler transform or algorithm to convert all character sequences recurring frequently into identical letters strings. The program then uses the Huffman coding move to front transform. bzip, which was the predecessor of bzip2, employed arithmetic coding but the successor uses Huffman coding. The performance of bzip2 is asymmetric. It has a relatively fast decompression. For a while in the early years of the century, the program did factor in the scope of multi threading and it was aimed at linear speed enhancements on multi core or multi cpu computers but this functionality has not been made available in subsequent versions released by the developer.

bzip2 is similar to gzip. Both are data compressors. bzip2 is not like zip or tar. Those have archiving ability. bzip2 is also only meant for single files. It cannot work on multiple files, archive splitting or encryption. It can work with external utilities like GnuPG and tar to facilitate such tasks. In a way, bzip2 stays true to its UNIX tradition.

bzip2 employs a compression stack technique that involves several layers atop one another and then the decompression follows a reverse order. The program carries out run length encoding of the initial data, applies the Burrows–Wheeler algorithm which is also known as block sorting, goes for the move to front transform and runs run length encoding of the MTF outcome, then applies the Huffman coding before selecting from different tables and using a unary base 1 encoding of the selected table, subsequently delta encoding of the code bit lengths and sparse bit array, which shows the used symbols.

There is no formal file format or specification but a reverse engineered informal spec is used. There is a four byte header for every .bz2 stream with none or some compressed blocks and a marker at the end of the stream that has a thirty two bit CRC. The signature or magic number of bzip2 is BZh. Many programs support the bzip2 file compression format including 7-Zip, micro-bzip2, Pbzip2, bzip2smp, smpbzip2, pyflate, bz2, Arnaud Bouchez’s bzip, lbzip2, mpibzip2, Apache Commons, jbzip2, DotNetZip and DotNetCompression.

**Technical Overview of bzip2**

The initial run length encoding has a sequence of four to two hundred and fifty five duplicate symbols. The consecutive sequence is then replaced by four symbols with a repeat length varying from zero to two hundred and fifty one. For instance, AAAAAAABBBBCCCD sequence gets replaced by AAAA\3BBBB\0CCCD. The 3 and 0 are byte values. The symbols are transformed only after the first four symbols so the run length is zero and the transformation is reversible. bzip2 can cause an expansion of a file in worst case scenarios but up to 1.25. In best case scenarios, the reduction is less than 0.02. This run length encoding has been criticized and even Julian Seward had admitted that it was a mistake and was only applicable to avert pathological instances.

The Burrows–Wheeler algorithm is at the crux of the file compression program. It is the main block sort that determines reversibility. This block is self contained and both input & output buffers do not undergo any changes in size. The limit at this stage is preset at nine hundred kilobytes and it does not change. The move to front transform during the file compression also remains completely distant in terms of its impact on the size. There is no change to the processed block. The symbols are used in an array. Every replaced symbol during processing has a location or index as an integral part of the array. Since identical characters or symbols that recur immediately are replaced with zero symbols, the program can maintain a low range of integers and this simplifies the encoding. Any legacy method of compression can work on the data that is transformed using this system.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

specially crafted file that triggers a buffer overread, causing a
Denial of Service. libbz2 and programs linking against it are also
affected.

### Workaround

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Analog: Denial of service — GLSA **200903-40**

A Denial of Service vulnerability was discovered in Analog.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/analog** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.0-r2** |

### Background

Analog is a a webserver log analyzer.

### Description

Diego E. Petteno reported that the Analog package in Gentoo is built
with its own copy of bzip2, making it vulnerable to CVE-2008-1372 (GLSA
200804-02).

### Impact

A local attacker could place specially crafted log files into a log
directory being analyzed by analog, e.g. /var/log/apache, resulting in
a crash when being processed by the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Analog users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/analog-6.0-r2"
```

NOTE: Analog is now linked against the system bzip2 library.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Slackware](http://www.slackware.org/)

# Slackware

The story of Slackware is pretty darn interesting, when you start to dig a little deeper. Perhaps the most compelling element to the narrative is its longevity. Some twenty-five years after it was first released to the world, Slackware is indeed still going strong. It remains a preferred Linux distribution method by many. As of this writing, it is also still being updated at a decently steady pace.

If you’re just starting to learn about Linux distribution options, you will hear about Slackware a lot. There are several reasons as to why that is the case.

An Introduction To Slackware
In order to better appreciate the longevity of Slackware, we have to cover two major subjects. First, let’s take a quick at the history of Slackware. That begins in 1993, although work began on it even earlier than that. With this foundation, we can then move on to the benefits of Slackware. These are benefits that have remained consistent through the decades. They can go a long way towards explaining the appeal of Slackware in 2019.

As of this year, Slackware is the longest-standing Linux distribution choice that is still being updated.

A Brief History Of Slackware
Working from an even older Linux distribution known as Softlanding Linux, Patrick Volkerding created Slackware in 1993. It was released to the world at large in April of that year, and it has been well-regarded and updated ever since. One of the main purposes for the creation of Slackware in the first place was to establish the most Unix-like distribution option for Linux. Many believe they have succeeded in this regard time and time again.

Both stability and simplicity in design have always been the goals of Slackware. According to Scott Chow of [Theblogstarter.com](https://www.theblogstarter.com), Slackware continues to aspire to make as few changes as humanly possible to software packages that come from the upstream. Furthermore, it also tries to avoid anticipating use cases, or precluding the decisions of the user. There is nothing in the way of a graphical procedure for installation. You also won’t find automatic dependency resolutions for any given software package. It utilizes plain text files, and utilizes a small set of shell scripts, when it comes to configuration and administration. Booting it will take you to an environment of what can be described as a common-line interface.

Slackware has been updated a few times throughout the years. Volkerding continues to spearhead these updates, which is perhaps why Slackware has maintained such impressive consistency from 1993 to the present. The most recent update was released in June of 2016—just two years ago.

As we get ready for a more detailed look at the benefits of Slackware, let’s take a quick look at some of the main Slackware features you can expect.

Slackware Features
One of the great things about Slackware is that it covers a lot of different needs right out of the gate. It is designed in such a way that you should be able to start working with it pretty quickly, and that would be regardless of your level of experience.

We won’t cover every single Slackware feature here, but let’s unpack some of the top things to expect:

• X-Window Systems
• Developmental environments for both C and C++
• The ability to use Perl
• Various utilities related to networking
• A server for mail
• A server for the web
• A server for FTP-related needs
• GNU Image Manipulation capabilities

As you can see, Slackware brings a lot to the table from the beginning. That is certainly an impressive benefit unto itself, but there are so many other potential advantages of using Slackware to keep in mind.

Slackware Benefits Explained
Ultimately, it is obviously up to you to decide if Slackware is right for your needs. The great thing about Slackware is that you will know the answer to that almost immediately. Many find it to be a straightforward collection of features that they can engage immediately. Others see management and administration of Slackware as being riddled with tedious challenges and time-consuming requirements.

For now, let’s explore some of the most commonly-cited benefits of using Slackware for Linux:

• Stability: Even the people who find Slackware to be too challenging will tell you that it at least benefits from being enormously stable. Over the course of the past twenty-five years, Slackware has continued to function without a whole lot of problems. It has moved nicely with the times, but it really hasn’t changed all that much. Few things related to computers have such stability.
• Security: Even for Linux distributions, there are traps and pitfalls that need to be constantly kept in mind. By and large, Slackware doesn’t have that problem. It probably helps that new versions of Slackware do not come out until everything is absolutely ready.
• Neutral: Remember that Slackware isn’t dependent upon a package manager. This is largely due to the fact that the applications are installed through a source. Slackware is not affiliated with any company either. Distribution was community-driven in the early 90s, and Slackware remains committed to that a quarter of a century later.
• Speediness: Another thing to keep in mind with Slackware is that it will only install what you absolutely want. Because of this, and keeping in mind the release policy we mentioned above, Slackware tends to run the fastest of the Linux distributions.
• Clean configuration: One of the big knocks against Slackware is that it doesn’t have graphical config utilities. No matter what you want to do, you are going to need to use the command line. Some people find this frustrating, but others would argue that this gives you the cleanest possible config files to work with.
• Want to understand Linux: There are other benefits to Slackware, but this one might just be our favorite. Even if you initially think Slackware has a higher learning curve than other distributions, there is a strong argument to be made that it will be worth the extra effort. Some don’t even experience this extra effort. However, if you do, think about Linux in broader terms. If you need to have a comprehensive understanding of Linux, you really can’t ask for a better teacher than Slackware. When you’ve mastered everything there is to know about Slackware, you will have pretty much mastered using Linux, as well.

Conclusion
Slackbuilds and strong IT cred are two more benefits that are worth taking to heart. At the end of the day, nothing in the world of Linux distributions can exist without a certain measure of controversy and disagreement. People also tend to be fiercely passionate and loyal about their favorite distribution. Nonetheless, Slackware has a staying power that would be absurd to ignore. It has worked for an incredibly long time, and it has done so in a field that has little time or patience for things that can’t be intensely/comprehensively useful. You could certainly make the argument that it has done more for bringing people to the world of Linux than just about anything else.

Is Slackware right for you? At this point, you are in the best position possible to make that determination. As we mentioned before, Slackware is best experienced in a hands-on capacity. You can research the subject to death, and you still won’t really know for sure. The only thing we can promise you, as we mentioned before, is that you are going to be able to decide how you feel about Slackware pretty quickly. It could be one of the best decisions you have ever made, in terms of working with a distribution that helps you meet your goals.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- rsync heap overflow in xattr code
A remotely exploitable heap overflow in rsync's xattr code has
been fixed. CVE-2008-1720 has been assigned to this issue.
rsync was fixed on openSUSE 10.3.
- MozillaFirefox 2.0.0.14 security release
Mozilla Firefox was brought to security update version 2.0.0.14.
Following security problems were fixed:
- MFSA 2008-20/CVE-2008-1380: Fixes for security problems in the
JavaScript engine described in MFSA 2008-15 (CVE-2008-1237) introduced
a stability problem, where some users experienced frequent crashes
during JavaScript garbage collection. These crashes may be exploitable
if someone finds a reliable way to trigger the crash.
We were not able to reproduce the crashes internally. Updates have been
released on SLE 10, SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- poppler PDF problems
Specially crafted PDF files with embedded fonts could potentially be
abused to trick applications that process PDF files into executing
arbitrary code (CVE-2008-1693).
Fixes for poppler for all distributions containing poppler have
been released.
- nagios cross site scripting problems
Several cross site scripting (XSS) issues in nagios were fixed
(CVE-2007-5624, CVE-2007-5803, CVE-2008-1360).

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
