Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-1055:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The `webmail.exe` CGI script uses a format string when constructing an error message for a missing template file. Specifically, user-supplied input (the `page` parameter) is directly incorporated into the error message passed to `lvprintf` without proper sanitization or format specifiers.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow exists in the handling of HTTP requests for CGI executables. The server allocates a 20000-byte buffer to store environment variables extracted from the HTTP request. The size of parameters and their values are truncated at 200 and 800 bytes, respectively. However, there are no checks on the total size of these variables, leading to a buffer overflow if the combined size of the variables exceeds the buffer capacity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:**  Improper handling of format strings can lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the format string specifiers.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** Lack of proper bounds checking when copying HTTP parameters to the environment variables buffer leads to memory corruption, potentially leading to code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Format String:** Remote code execution may be possible via crafted `page` parameters, but it's not explicitly confirmed.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** While the buffer overflow can lead to control of some registers, it's stated that code execution is "not certain." However, it can potentially lead to code execution or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Format String:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a malicious HTTP request to `webmail.exe` with the `page` parameter set to format string specifiers. Example URL: `http://SERVER/scripts/webmail.exe?page=%n%n%n%s%s%s%s`
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The attacker sends an HTTP request to a CGI executable (like `webmail.exe`) with many parameters or large parameter values to overflow the environment variables buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**

* The affected software is SurgeMail Mail Server and Netwin's WebMail.
* The vulnerabilities affect multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, MacOSX, and Solaris.
* No fix was available at the time of the report.
*  The buffer overflow affects both the `surgemail` and `swatch` (port 7027) processes.
