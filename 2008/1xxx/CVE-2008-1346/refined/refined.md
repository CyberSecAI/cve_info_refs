    "ID": "CVE-2008-1346",
    "content": "The provided content indicates multiple vulnerabilities in EasyGallery 5.0tr:\n\n**1. SQL Injection:**\n\n*   **Root cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `catid` parameter within the `index.php` file.\n*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection. An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the `catid` parameter.\n*  **Attack vector:** The vulnerability is accessed via an HTTP GET request to index.php\n*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database. The example provided demonstrates how to extract username and password hashes from the `edp_puusers` table.\n*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious HTTP request to the vulnerable file.\n\n**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in URI:**\n\n*   **Root cause:** The application does not properly sanitize the URI, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.\n*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The URI itself is vulnerable to code injection.\n*   **Attack vector:** An attacker can inject JavaScript code into the URI, which will be executed by the victim's browser.\n*   **Impact:**  An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, allowing them to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.\n*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to get a user to access the malicious link.\n\n**3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Query Parameter:**\n\n*   **Root cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `q` parameter in the `index.php` file when `help=about` is set.\n*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the `q` parameter.\n*   **Attack vector:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP GET request to index.php with help=about and the malicious code in q parameter.\n*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, allowing them to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.\n*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to get a user to access the malicious link.\n",
