### FAQs

[What is antivirus software?](#collapse-88635)
Antivirus software is a type of software designed to detect, prevent, and remove dangerous software or malware from your computer — including viruses, trojans, ransomware, adware, spyware, and more. It starts by scanning a computer’s files, programs, and disks for any hidden malware or other sophisticated threats. If threats are detected, antivirus software can quarantine infected files to prevent them from taking over your whole device.

It’s essential to have antivirus software installed on your computer because it adds a layer of [cybersecurity protection](/c-b-what-is-cybersecurity) and strengthens your online privacy and security. [Choosing the right antivirus software](https://blog.avast.com/which-type-of-antivirus-should-you-choose) can help can prevent threats that could cause data loss, system corruption, financial loss, [identity theft](/c-identity-theft), and privacy breaches.

[Is there a 100% free antivirus?](#collapse-85128)
Yes, there are various free antivirus software, although not all of them will provide you with full protection. Avast Free Antivirus is completely free and offers all the security you need.

[How do I detect and remove viruses and other malware?](#collapse-69715)
Avast’s free antivirus software detects and blocks all [types of malware](/c-malware) in real time to prevent them from infecting your computer. At the same time, it scans your PC to [remove viruses and other malware](/c-virus-removal-tool) automatically before they can do real damage.

[Is free virus protection enough protection?](#collapse-67298)
The basic level of virus protection, like Windows Defender (Windows built-in security), may not offer the same comprehensive features, updates, and support as advanced antivirus software.

Technology is always changing which means cybercriminals can develop new tactics. Windows Defender can serve as basic protection for your computer but may not be enough to protect you from new emerging threats. It's important to consider a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity for optimal protection in the long run and you can start by trying out a free virus protection software, like **Avast Free Antivirus.**

[What does antivirus software do?](#collapse-26057)
Trusted by hundreds of millions of users around the world, Avast uses advanced machine learning techniques to [protect against ransomware attacks](/c-ransomware-protection-tool) and other emerging threats. Avast Free Antivirus software detects, blocks, and removes all types of malware: viruses, adware, [spyware](/c-spyware), [Trojans](/c-trojan), and more. You’ll also get security for your Wi-Fi network and real-time defense against [phishing attacks](/c-phishing), unsafe websites, and other threats to your devices.

[Why is Avast one of the best free antivirus solutions?](#collapse-8404)
Avast’s free antivirus software combines cutting-edge, AI-driven cybersecurity with a massive threat-detection network of over 435 million users that lets us protect our entire community in real time against online threats whenever they appear.

Our industry-leading antivirus engine is just one of the many reasons why Avast Free Antivirus consistently earns high praise and top awards from PCMag, AV-Comparatives, AV-Test, and other independent experts. We have one of the [best antivirus software solutions](/c-best-free-antivirus-software) available, because we have the right antivirus protection for all your needs.

In 2021, Avast released a new and enhanced product called [Avast One](https://www.avast.com/avast-one), which is now available in the [United States](https://www.avast.com/en-us/avast-one), [United Kingdom](https://www.avast.com/en-gb/avast-one), [Canada](https://www.avast.com/en-ca/avast-one), [Australia](https://www.avast.com/en-au/avast-one), [Switzerland](https://www.avast.com/fr-ch/avast-one), [France](https://www.avast.com/fr-fr/avast-one), and [Germany](https://www.avast.com/de-de/avast-one).

[Why is Avast Free Antivirus even better than Windows Defender?](#collapse-5685)
Now known as Microsoft Defender, [Windows Defender isn’t enough](/c-is-windows-defender-enough) to match leading third-party PC antivirus programs. While it’ll keep your computer relatively safe against most types of malware, its anti-phishing protection is limited to Microsoft Edge — so you’ll need Avast Free Antivirus to protect you on other browsers like Chrome and Firefox. Microsoft Defender also doesn’t score quite as highly with independent testing labs like AV-Comparatives. For comprehensive threat protection on your PC, go with Avast — the world’s most trusted antivirus.

[How long can I use Avast Free Antivirus on my device?](#collapse-40894)
You can use our free antivirus for as long as you want once you activate it. After 12 months, our app might prompt you to reactivate your free subscription so that you can keeping using it.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Advisory: avast! 4.7 aavmker4.sys Kernel Memory Corruption
Advisory ID: TKADV2008-002
Revision: 1.1
Release Date: 2008/03/30
Last Modified: 2008/12/20
Date Reported: 2008/03/16
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: avast! 4.7 Professional Edition
avast! 4.7 Home Edition
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
Vendor URL: http://www.avast.com
Vendor Status: Vendor has released a fixed version
CVE-ID: CVE-2008-1625
Patch development time: 13 days
======================
Vulnerability details:
======================
The kernel driver aavmker4.sys shipped with avast! 4.7 contains a
vulnerability in the code that handles IOCTL requests. Exploitation of this
vulnerability can result in:
1) local denial of service attacks (system crash due to a kernel panic), or
2) local execution of arbitrary code at the kernel level (complete system
compromise)
The issue can be triggered by sending a specially crafted IOCTL request.
No special user rights are necessary to exploit the vulnerability.
======================
Technical description:
======================
The IOCTL call 0xb2d60030 of the aavmker4.sys kernel driver shipped with
avast! 4.7 accepts user supplied input that doesn't get validated enough.
In consequence it is possible to overwrite arbitrary memory addresses with
arbitrary values.
Disassembly of aavmker4.sys (version 4.7.1098.0):

(1) Vulnerable IOCTL control code
(2) ESI now points to user controlled IOCTL input data
(3) The size of the IOCTL input data must be 0x878
(4) Minor check of the user supplied data
(5) EAX now also points to the user controlled IOCTL input data
(6) + (7) Minor checks of the user supplied data
(8) The user supplied data (ESI) is used as source data for the following
memcpy function
(9) The number of bytes that get copied by the following memcpy function
(ECX)
(10) A user controlled memory address (EDI) is used as a destination for
the following memcpy function
(11) The memcpy function copies 0x21a bytes of user controlled data to a
user controlled memory address
This can be exploited to control the kernel execution flow and to execute
arbitrary code at the kernel level.
