    "ID": "CVE-2008-1906",
    "content": "The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in CPCommerce 1.1.0, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Local File Inclusion (LFI). This entry focuses on the Local File Inclusion vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input passed to the 'language' and 'action' parameters before using it in file inclusion operations.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nLocal File Inclusion: Unsanitized input in the 'language' parameter within `actions/language.act.php` and the 'action' parameter in `_functions.php` allows for the inclusion of arbitrary local files.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAn attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, or other confidential data by manipulating the 'language' and 'action' parameters in the URL.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nHTTP GET requests with malicious values for the 'language' or 'action' parameters. The attacker crafts a URL containing the LFI payload that traverses directories.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAttacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server. No authentication is needed.",
    "additional_information": "The content includes Proof of Concept (POC) URLs demonstrating the vulnerability, showcasing the ability to include arbitrary files using directory traversal sequences within the 'language' and 'action' parameters."
