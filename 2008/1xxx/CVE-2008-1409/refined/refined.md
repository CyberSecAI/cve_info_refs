Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1409

**Vulnerability:** Multiple Local File Inclusion (LFI)

**Root Cause:** The Exero CMS 1.0.1 application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `theme` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files on the server. Specifically, the application uses the value of the `theme` parameter to determine which file to include in various scripts without proper input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The core weakness is the ability to include local files. The application uses the `theme` parameter in several scripts to determine which file to include, without proper sanitization or validation, enabling the LFI vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't sanitize or validate the user-provided `theme` parameter before using it in file inclusion operations. This allows an attacker to manipulate it to include arbitrary files.
*  **Null byte injection:** The usage of `%00` in the exploit demonstrates that the vulnerability is also exploitable through null byte injection, which can be used to bypass some file extension checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, database credentials, and source code.
*   **Potential for Code Execution:** If the attacker can include a file containing malicious code (e.g., a PHP script), it could be executed by the server, leading to complete compromise.
*   **Data Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive information contained in the included files.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `theme` parameter in the URL.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application to send HTTP requests.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of web request parameters.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit examples do not seem to require any authentication.

**Specific Vulnerable Files:** The exploit examples provided show that the `theme` parameter vulnerability exists in multiple files within the Exero CMS 1.0.1 application, including:
    *   `themes/Default/usercp/index.php`
    *   `themes/Default/usercp/editpassword.php`
    *   `themes/Default/usercp/avatar.php`
    *   `themes/Default/custompage.php`
    *   `themes/Default/errors/404.php`
    *   `themes/Default/members/memberslist.php`
    *   `themes/Default/members/profile.php`
    *   `themes/Default/news/index.php`
    *  `themes/Default/news/fullview.php`
    * `themes/Default/nopermission.php`

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit examples use `Local File %00`, demonstrating the use of a null byte to terminate the file path, which could bypass certain file inclusion checks.
*   The exploit examples specify the vulnerable script and the `theme` parameter used for exploitation.

This information provides a clear understanding of the LFI vulnerability present in Exero CMS 1.0.1, its exploitation method, and its potential impact.
