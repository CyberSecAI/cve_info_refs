How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Comix: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200804-29**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Comix may lead to execution of arbitrary
commands and a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/comix** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.6.4-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.6.4-r1** |

### Background

Comix is a GTK comic book viewer.

### Description

Comix does not properly sanitize filenames containing shell
metacharacters when they are passed to the rar, unrar, or jpegtran
programs (CVE-2008-1568). Comix also creates directories with
predictable names (CVE-2008-1796).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit the first vulnerability by enticing a
user to use Comix to open a file with a specially crafted filename,
resulting in the execution of arbitrary commands. The second
vulnerability could be exploited by a local attacker to cause a Denial
of Service by creating a file or directory with the same filename as
the predictable filename used by Comix.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Comix users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/comix-3.6.4-r1"
```

Comix uses insufficient shell escaping when calling external programs

This all bombs out when faced with file or directory names that contain
the double quote character (") or a backslash.

   * Non-maintainer upload by the Security Team.
   * Apply patch by Mamoru Tasaka to fix arbitrary code execution
     via crafted file names because of passing the filename directly

   * Apply patch by Mamoru Tasaka to use empfile.mkdtemp() to enable comix
     for multi-user environments and thus prevent a race condition in /tmp
     without a real security impact (Closes: #[462836](bugreport.cgi?bug=462836)).
