Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1383:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper use of the `docert()` function within the `ssl-cert.eclass` in Gentoo Linux. This function, designed to generate SSL certificates and keys, was being called during the source building stages (specifically, `src_compile()` or `src_install()`) of certain ebuilds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Private Key Exposure:** When `docert()` is called in the source building phases, the generated SSL private keys are included in the binary packages (binpkgs).
- **Lack of Protection:** These binpkgs are publicly readable, meaning a local attacker or a remote attacker (if the packages are served over a network) can extract the private keys from the binary package.
- **Shared Keys:** If the same binpkg is used on multiple machines, all the machines will end up using the same SSL private key, leading to security risks and functional issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Attackers:** A local attacker can easily recover the SSL private keys from the generated binary packages on the system.
- **Remote Attackers:** Remote attackers can also recover the keys if they have access to the packages served over the network.
- **Compromised SSL/TLS:** Exploitation of this vulnerability compromises the confidentiality and integrity of SSL/TLS-based communication, as the private keys used for encryption are exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the system can directly extract private keys from binary packages.
- **Network Access:** If binary packages are served over a network, a remote attacker can obtain the packages and subsequently extract private keys.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local:** The attacker needs local user access to the system where the vulnerable packages were built.
- **Remote:** The attacker requires network access to a location where the vulnerable binary packages are stored.
- **Technical Skill:** The attacker requires basic technical skill to unpack archive files.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue primarily affects binary packages created using the "*emerge --buildpkg (-b)*" or "*--buildpkgonly (-B)*" options, but not those created using "*quickpkg*".
- The vulnerable packages include `app-admin/conserver`, `mail-mta/postfix`, `net-ftp/netkit-ftpd`, `net-im/ejabberd`, `net-irc/unrealircd`, `net-mail/cyrus-imapd`, `net-mail/dovecot`, `net-misc/stunnel`, and `net-nntp/inn`.
- The vulnerability was resolved by moving the SSL certificate generation to the `pkg_postinst()` phase of the ebuild process and by renaming the function to install_cert.
- The original `docert()` function was replaced with a dummy function in the eclass to prevent further insecure use.
- Users were advised to upgrade to the fixed versions of the affected packages and remove the compromised SSL certificates.
