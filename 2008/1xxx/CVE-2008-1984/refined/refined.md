Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1984

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The eTrust Common Services (Transport) Daemon (eCSqdmn), which listens on port 1882, has a vulnerability caused by an unchecked 32-bit number provided by a client. This number is used to determine the position of the next data block.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of the 32-bit number. A malformed value can be provided by the attacker.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Providing a malformed value can crash the `eCSqdmn` service. The service automatically restarts after a short period, requiring the attacker to repeatedly exploit the vulnerability to maintain a denial-of-service state.
    *   CPU exhaustion: Malformed values can also trigger an endless loop within the service, leading to 100% CPU usage.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability over a network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker only needs the ability to send network packets to port 1882 on the target machine where the vulnerable `eCSqdmn` service is running. They do not need any authentication credentials.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable software is "eTrust Secure Content Manager" specifically, versions eCSqdmn <= 8.0.28000.511.
*   The exploit is performed over port 1882.
*   A proof of concept (PoC) exploit is available at `http://aluigi.org/poc/ecsqdamn.zip`.
*   There is no fix available at the time of the report.
