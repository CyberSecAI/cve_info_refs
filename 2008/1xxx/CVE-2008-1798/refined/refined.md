```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses user-supplied input (`$_GET['lng']`) in a file include statement without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files on the server, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities or attack vectors.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `lng` parameter in the URL, an attacker can specify a path to a file they want to be included.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication or special privileges are needed."
