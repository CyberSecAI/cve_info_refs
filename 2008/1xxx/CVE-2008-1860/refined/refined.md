      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_34a14301_20250125_013559.html",
      "root_cause": "PHP Code Injection via the 'default' parameter in admin.php",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a file write operation.",
        "Specifically, the 'default' parameter from $_GET is not properly validated before being passed to the writeconfig() function, which writes to Config.php."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote Command Execution",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting a malicious URL with PHP code in the 'default' parameter to admin.php, an attacker can inject code into the Config.php file.",
        "This injected code can be executed by later accessing Config.php with a crafted 'cmd' parameter."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is needed.",
      "additional_information": "The exploit works even with magic_quotes_gpc = On, because stripslashes is called on the input before writing to the file. An example perl exploit script is included in the text provided."
