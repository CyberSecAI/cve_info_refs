  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2008-1631",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user input within the login functionality. The application also has multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication and potentially gain unauthorized access to the application and the database.

      "attack_vectors": [
        "The SQL injection vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted login request using the 'UserId' parameter.",
         "The XSS vulnerabilities are triggered by injecting malicious javascript code into the 'language' parameter in several PHP pages"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special system access is required."
