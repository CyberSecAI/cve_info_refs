Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2008-1515:

**Summary:**

This CVE relates to a vulnerability in the OTRS (Open Ticket Request System) trouble ticket system. A bug in OTRS allows a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access via the SOAP interface without needing a valid username.

**Details:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the OTRS software related to how it handles authentication through the SOAP interface. Specifically, it appears that the system does not properly validate or require a valid username when handling SOAP requests.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** The core issue is the ability to bypass authentication checks when accessing OTRS via its SOAP interface.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Access:** An attacker could potentially gain complete access to the OTRS system, including the ability to read, modify, or create tickets, access sensitive data, and potentially compromise the entire system.
    *   **Command Execution:** While not explicitly stated, unauthorized access through SOAP interface could lead to command execution, depending on the privileges granted to the attacker via the unauthorized access.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via the SOAP interface of the OTRS system.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the OTRS server.
    *   **SOAP Interface Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware of the existence of the SOAP interface and how to send the malicious requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was specifically addressed in openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 where OTRS was included.
*   The SUSE Security Summary Report explicitly lists this vulnerability as "otrs SOAP command execution"
*   The SUSE security report mentions that the fix was available on their FTP server and via YaST Online Update.
