  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the 'roomid' parameter within the 'modules/WebChat/index.php' script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, potentially leading to the retrieval of sensitive data (e.g., usernames and passwords from the 'exv2_users' table). It could also allow for further database manipulation or unauthorized access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to 'modules/WebChat/index.php' with a malicious 'roomid' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application, meaning they require network access to the application."
