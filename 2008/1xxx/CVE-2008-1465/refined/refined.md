Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1465

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `com_restaurante` component for Joomla!.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `detail` task is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and password hashes from the `jos_users` table.
- Potential for full system compromise (depending on database access and further vulnerabilities)

**Attack Vectors:**
-  HTTP GET request to the vulnerable component, specifically the `index.php` file, with a crafted `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Joomla! application.
- No special privileges are required beyond the ability to send requests.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses a crafted URL: `index.php?option=com_restaurante&task=detail&Itemid=S@BUN&id=-99999/**/union/**/select/**/0,0,0x3a,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11,12,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,concat(username,0x3a,password)/**/from/**/jos_users/*`
- This URL injects SQL code via the `id` parameter using a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve username and password information from the `jos_users` table.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable component is called "Restaurante" version 1.0, created by "Detodas".
- A Google dork for finding vulnerable sites is provided: `allinurl: "com_restaurante"`.
