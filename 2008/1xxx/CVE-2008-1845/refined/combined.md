## [mksh(1)](htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm) R59c

This is the website of the MirBSD‚Ñ¢ Korn Shell, an actively developed free
implementation of the Korn Shell programming language and a successor to the
Public Domain Korn Shell (pdksh).

![mksh Logo](pics/mksh128x100.png)
This page is always accessible via a redirection at <http://mirbsd.de/mksh>, which is
the canonical homepage URI. There also is (most of the time) [mksh on Freshmeat](http://freecode.com/projects/mksh) and an [mksh project page on ohlol](https://www.ohloh.net/p/mksh), a
statistics site. mksh is [experimentally
tracked at Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/mksh). Download the Logo as [SVG](pics/mksh.svg) if you want. There‚Äôs also a [full licence terms](TaC-mksh.txt) overview; it suffices
to say mksh is [‚íª Copyfree](http://copyfree.org/) licenced.

mksh *must* always be written either ‚Äúmksh‚Äù (all-lowercase) or
‚ÄúMirBSD Korn Shell‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthere is no other spelling. It‚Äôs usually pronounced
by spelling out the four letters m, k, s and h individually, or by saying
‚ÄúMirBSD Korn Shell‚Äù.

## Introduction

The current version of mksh is **mksh R59c** from
*31 October 2020*.

Thanks to ‚ÄúDer Verein [trash.net](http://www.trash.net/verein/)‚Äù
for providing access to a Solaris 8 box. Thanks to Julian ‚Äúyofuh‚Äù Wiesener

AIX 5.3 system with gcc and xlC installed. (Both are now defunct.) Thanks to
Jupp ‚Äúcnuke‚Äù S√∂ntgen for building on AIX in Dresden nowadays. Thanks to HP
TestDrive/PvP/DSPP/CLOE, which helps in keeping mksh portable to several
Unixes and compilers, and track down some architecture- or glibc-specific
bugs. (These days, HP-UX/IA64 only, though.) Thanks to gnubber‚Äôs admin (Barry
‚Äúbddebian‚Äù deFreese), as well as Samuel ‚Äúyoupi‚Äù Thibault, for providing shell
access to a Debian GNU/Hurd system. Thanks to Lucas ‚Äúlaffer1‚Äù Holt for ssh
access to the MidnightBSD server. Thanks to Waldemar ‚Äúwbx‚Äù Brodkorb for

Thanks Stanley J. Johnson and the MirBSD southern hemisphere manager
Finn Thain, who made the A/UX port possible. Thanks to Redfoxmoon for
testing on several old systems, such as HP-UX 9 (m68k), and sometimes
even getting me access.
No thanks to Intel for not including mksh in their programme analysing code.
(Did I miss anyone? Mail me if so. Some of these are past, anyway.)

What is [mksh(1)](htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm)?‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäShort answer: The MirBSD Korn Shell. Okay, but what
exactly does it do, or why another shell? These questions will be answered
[here](mksh_old.htm#contrib) for the people interested. Right now, you only
need to know that mksh is a [DFSG](http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)-free
and [OSD](http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd)-compliant (and OSI
approved)
successor to pdksh, developed as part of [the
MirOS Project](http://mirbsd.de/) as native Bourne/POSIX/Korn shell for MirOS BSD, but also
to be readily available under other UNIX¬Æ-like operating systems.

The source code for mksh is available at the MirOS Project mirrors
as well as these of other operating system projects due to being [included](#otheros) in these; however, we do not provide binaries.
Find [instructions to build and install mksh](#build) below, or
ask your operating environment vendor to package and include mksh; we provide
assistance for this task if asked. *Licencing* permits this as long
as due credit is given to the authors and contributors and the copyright
notices are not removed in their entirety; modifying is allowed (but if
the result is still called mksh, it‚Äôs discouraged; talk with us if you
feel you have to modify mksh). The individual licences used are the ‚íª MirOS
licence, and (for BSD compatibility on other operating systems) the 3-clause
UCB licence and the ISC licence; [full
terms](TaC-mksh.txt) are available. pdksh originally was public domain, with a few
exceptions, but these files are not part of mksh R21 or up. The [mksh(1)](htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm) author
(mirabilos) acknowledges the contributions of these people who dedicated pdksh
and oksh to the public, and asserts a collective copyright on the code.
All these licences are DFSG clean and conform to the OSD, and the MirOS
Licence is listed on the pages of the ifrOSS licence centre as well as
in the FSF/UNESCO Directory of Free Software. The MirBSD Korn Shell is [OSI Certified ![Open Source Software‚Ñ¢](pics/open_source_button.png)](permalinks/news_e20081114-nn.htm) and its [manual](/man/mksh.1) is [Open Knowledge](http://www.opendefinition.org/1.0).

To compile mksh, you will need a Bourne or POSIX shell (Solaris
/bin/sh is enough, the Z shell works), a C compiler, system and C
library header files and the standard C runtime. You will also need a set of
standard UNIX¬Æ tools on a supported operating system: any recent BSD; Darwin,
Apple Mac OSX; Interix (Microsoft¬Æ Services for Unix 3.5, maybe Subsystem for
Unix Applications on Win2003/Vista); GNU/Cygwin; UWIN; GNU/Linux (libc5,
glibc, dietlibc, ¬µClibc, some klibc systems are tested), Debian GNU/kFreeBSD,
GNU/Hurd or GNU/Linux; Sun Solaris (8, 9, 10, 11), OpenSolaris; AIX; IRIX;
HP-UX 11i; OSF/1; ULTRIX; Minix 3; NeXTstep (but not OpenStep 4.2); QNX;
BeOS (with limitations) or Haiku; Xenix, SCO OpenServer 3.2r4.2 or 5 (with
limitations) or 6 or SCO UnixWare;¬†Minoca OS; ‚Ä¶

To run the regression test suite, you will need a not
too antiquated Perl optimally with POSIX.pm or Errno.pm as well as [/bin](mksh_old.htm#editor)/ed (whose installation is
strongly suggested anyway, because it‚Äôs the standard FCEDIT history
editor and standard UNIX¬Æ text editor), as well as a controlling terminal,
usually /dev/tty or provided from [script(1)](htman/i386/man1/script.htm) or GNU screen.

To use mksh, you only need the C runtime (and any supplemental libraries
the binary was linked against) and, optionally, /bin/ed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor
interactive use, a controlling terminal is highly recommended because job
control does not work without one.

To make full use of [mksh(1)](htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm)‚Äôs interactive features, it is recommended to
copy the dot.mkshrc file from the source distribution as
~/.mkshrc into the user‚Äôs home directory and let the user adjust
it to suit his needs. The sample file configures a few aliases and shell
functions as well as a sensible prompt ($PS1) and some csh-like
directory stack functions and zsh-like hooks. Full use of this file requires
a few special UNIX¬Æ tools. Note that $ENV must not be set for
[mksh(1)](htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm) to parse the ~/.mkshrc file at startup.

## Support

We provide an online manual page in [HTML](/man/mksh.1) and [PDF](/MirOS/dist/mir/mksh/mksh.pdf) format.
Reading books about Korn Shells in general is recommended as further help,
but beware of the [differences](mksh_old.htm#contrib) (ATTENTION
outdated content behind that link) to other shells. Some
ISBNs are listed at the end of the manual page.

A collection of some frequently asked questions is available as the [mksh FAQ](mksh-faq.htm).

If you require additional assistance or want to discuss bugs, features
or enhancements, write to the [miros-mksh
mailing list](rss.htm#lists) (or subscribe to it by sending an eMail to the postmaster telling which address
to subscribe to which list(s)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin your case, the miros-mksh list, but we
have [more mailing lists](rss.htm#lists)).
The mailing list can be reached via the GMane archive using either NNTP or [HTTP](http://news.gmane.org/gmane.os.miros.mksh), or at [The Mail
Archive](http://www.mail-archive.com/miros-mksh%40mirbsd.org/), although not at MARC.
Joining the [IRC](irc.htm) channel #!/bin/mksh (no
joke, this is really the channel‚Äôs name) is recommended as well.

## Installation

Skip to the section about being [included in operating
environments](#otheros) unless you really want to compile mksh from source yourself
or create a package for your operating system of choice.

First off, you have to download the source code from any of the mirrors
listed below, or any other mirror you know of. Alternatively, use the [development version](#getcvs) from CVS. Official source code
distributions are digitally signed with [gzsig(1)](htman/i386/man1/gzsig.htm) using the MirOS Project‚Äôs [current signature key](/gzsigkey.cer). Please verify the signature
*as well as* the hashes and/or checksums below, so you‚Äôre sure the
content is intact and the version number on the archive is correct.

### Decompression

We‚Äôre using [gzip(1)](htman/i386/man1/gzip.htm)-compressed POSIX us[tar(1)](htman/i386/man1/tar.htm) distfiles nowadays,
so a simple tar -xzf mksh-R59c.tgz will work. It will create all
files in a subdirectory ./mksh/.

### Patching

If you‚Äôre a packager/vendor and need to patch mksh and deviate from the
default behaviour for that version which is indicated from $KSH\_VERSION,
define the [cpp(GNU)](htman/i386/manINFO/cpp.html) KSH\_VERSIONNAME\_VENDOR\_EXT macro to a C string
beginning with a space and a plus sign, followed by a tag of yours, e.g. add
-DKSH\_VERSIONNAME\_VENDOR\_EXT=\"\ +aCoolDistro\" to CPPFLAGS
so they can be distinguished. I think this is a reasonable request.

In contrast to the old patching mode, this does not require patching the
testsuite any more.

### Compilation

In the currently recommended mode of installation, the source code is
compiled twice, once for mksh and once for lksh, in different build
directories. It‚Äôs possible, even customary, to build them with diverging
options‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääe.g. it‚Äôs strongly recommended to build lksh with
-DMKSH\_BINSHPOSIX so it auto-enables set -o posix when
called as /bin/sh; linking it statically is also very common,
although less wise when using glibc; some add -DMKSH\_BINSHREDUCED
and/or the [printf(1)](htman/i386/man1/printf.htm) builtin as well.

##### Building mksh

Consider reading [operating environment-specific
notes](mksh_oe.htm) first. **RUN THE TESTSUITE after building** (or,
when cross-building, on the target system); several ‚Äúalternative libcs‚Äù
and other environments have *known* bugs that *cannot* be
detected at configure or compile time (otherwise, we‚Äôd do that already).

Now you‚Äôre in the source code directory; Build.sh does all the
magic for you. In theory, invoking the command

% /bin/sh ./Build.sh

should work. Relative paths can be used too, for example, instead of [cd(1)](htman/i386/man1/cd.htm)ing
to the source directory, you could‚Äôve done

% mkdir build; cd build; /bin/sh ../mksh/Build.sh

Doing such an ‚Äúout-of-tree‚Äù build is recommended.

It is optionally possible to place files, such as printf.c, into
either the current or the source directory. It will need a compile option
(see [building](mksh_old.htm#compile)) to be activated.

The build script requires a Bourne shell (Solaris /bin/sh, the [Heirloom sh](http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/sh.html), DEC OSF/1
V2.0 /bin/sh), Korn shell (ksh, ksh88, ksh93, pdksh, mksh, oksh,
maybe the MKS ksh), POSIX shell (posh, /usr/xpg4/bin/sh, ash, dash,
yash), a related shell (JÔøΩrg/Jvrg/Joerg/J√∂rg Schilling‚Äôs bosh or sh, or the
Z Shell), or a Bourne or POSIX superset (such as GNU bash) to work; the
ULTRIX /bin/sh or the C shell (csh, tcsh) or ‚Äúbsh‚Äù or a scripting
shell like the wish won‚Äôt.
Accepted arguments are:

* -A‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääinstead of adding the autoconfiguration results to
  $CPPFLAGS, write them into a file; for when command line or
  compiler limits would otherwise be reached
* -c *mode*‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääset compiler mode:
  + dragonegg to use the LLVM Dragonegg plugin with GCC
  + llvm to compile to bytecode, optimise there (see the
    -O/-o options) and link with LLVM tools
  + ~~The options combine and lto were removed, as
    link-time optimisation has proven to be too fragile in compilers.~~
  + trace (with GCC) to trace the input files (source, headers,
    objects, static libraries, dynamic libraries) which go into the binary;
    e.g. for determining mksh-static Built-Using (requires POSIX sh)
* -g‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbuild with debug info, Valgrind and LLVM/Clang scan-build
  assertions, and -DDEBUG in place
* -j‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääparallel build
* -M‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädo not compile but create Makefrag.inc
* -O‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää(default) with ‚Äú-c llvm‚Äù use ‚Äú-std-compile-opts‚Äù
* -o *opts*‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith ‚Äú-c llvm‚Äù use these optimisations
* -Q‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbe (only) a little less verbose
* -r‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädon‚Äôt try to build a pre-formatted version
  of the manual page using [nroff(1)](htman/i386/man1/nroff.htm) if found‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää*recommended*
* -v‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädisplay version and exit

Note: ‚Äú-M‚Äù is incompatible with ‚Äú-c *somemode*‚Äù and ‚Äú-j‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääspecify
LTO and parallel make using your [make(1)](htman/i386/man1/make.htm) tool‚Äôs facilities instead. Also,
‚Äú-c dragonegg‚Äù does not work with ‚Äú-j‚Äù (the former is ignored).

Note: any kind of ‚Äú-c *somemode*‚Äù optimisation is brittle: LLVM
(both llvm and dragonegg) have not been used for a long time; GCC‚Äôs LTO
breaks so often we forcibly disable it nowadays and stopped offering it.
**Run the testsuite** if you use one!

The [build
script](cvs.cgi/src/bin/mksh/Build.sh?rev=HEAD) also honours some environment variables detailed at its end.

Install this binary as /bin/mksh and its manual page; you may
want to also install dot.mkshrc, either directly into the skeleton
directory, or with [a
wrapper /etc/skel/.mkshrc file](http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/mksh.git/plain/debian/.mkshrc) that reads /etc/mkshrc,
especially if packaging for a GNU distribution.

##### Building lksh

Add the -L flag to the Build.sh to create [lksh(1)](htman/i386/man1/lksh.htm),
a variant of the shell that uses POSIX-compliant arithmetics with the
host ‚Äúlong‚Äù data type, instead of mksh‚Äôs guaranteed-reliable 32-bit
arithmetics. You probably want to add -DMKSH\_BINSHPOSIX and,
possibly, -DMKSH\_BINSHREDUCED to the command line and install
the lksh binary as your system /bin/sh if you go that
route. (This shell is not intended to be used interactively. Its purpose
is to run legacy sh scripts (especially with the MKSH\_BINSHREDUCED
option) and POSIX sh scripts, including Debian maintainer scripts.)

Install this binary as /bin/lksh and its companion manpage,
but remember that it does not come stand-alone and to always ship the
full proper mksh shell alongside it.

#### Operating Environment-specific notes

‚Ä¶ are now on [their own page](mksh_oe.htm).

### After compiling

The Build.sh script generates an executable (‚Äúmksh‚Äù, except on
GNU/Cygwin, where it is called ‚Äúmksh.exe‚Äù), a shell script to use the newly
built mksh to run the regression test suite (‚Äútest.sh‚Äù), and (unless the
-r option was given) a pre-formatted manual page (‚Äúmksh.cat1‚Äù).
It also lists installation instructions unless -Q was provided.
Now it‚Äôs the time to run
% ./test.sh -v -f

in order to see if the shell works. The regression testsuite will exit
with errorlevel 1 if any tests failed that are not marked as allowed to
fail (e.g. OS dependent) or expected to fail, 0 otherwise. Use instead a ‚Äò+f‚Äô
option if you do not have a fast (say 1¬Ω GHz Pentium-M) machine.

The regression tests need a controlling tty. Please ensure you have one,
even for bulk/d√¶monised builds; you can use GNU screen or [script(1)](htman/i386/man1/script.htm) to
provide one by running the testsuite inside it (see the Debian and OpenSuSE
Buildservive packaging for examples of how to do it). If, however, you
absolutely cannot get the necessary utilities and devices installed in
the build chroot, run: ./test.sh -v -C regress:no-ctty

To actually install mksh, copy the binary to some place in $PATH, i.e.
/bin/mksh, $HOME/.bin/mksh, /usr/local/bin/mksh, or whatever your packaging
system wants; strip it and run chmod 555 on it. (This can easily be achieved
with [install(1)](htman/i386/man1/install.htm)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääon Solaris, this is /usr/ucb/install not /usr/bin/install ‚Äì
with the arguments -c, -s, -m 755¬π, and -o/-g. ‚ë† with 555, [strip(1)](htman/i386/man1/strip.htm) cannot
write the file any more, chmod 555 afterwards.) Also append its installation
path to /etc/shells, install the dot.mkshrc file (usually
alongside with the copyright file and other documentation), copy it to
/etc/skel/.mkshrc if your operating environment has this means to
include default dotfiles; install either the catman page (mksh.cat1) to,
for example, /usr/share/man/cat1/mksh.0, or the mdoc page (mksh.1) to the
standard location (/usr/share/man/man1/ or /usr/man/man1/ or whatever your
operating environment requires). The manual page requires the Berkeley mdoc
macros (either the BSD or the GNU groff version) to be installed during
formatting time.

Note that a ~/.mkshrc file will *not* be executed if
$ENV is set and not empty, nor is there an /etc/mkshrc.

## For packagers: Upgrades

**Note:** This is *not* [the
ChangeLog](#clog), these are the packager-visible upgrade notes regarding
changes in the build system (Build.sh and friends, compiler
support, packaging conventions, bad examples, etc). This is also *not*
[the users' upgrade caveat list](#caveat).
Packagers also
please note: it‚Äôs mksh or ‚ÄúThe MirBSD Korn Shell‚Äù (‚ÄúMidnightBSD
Korn Shell‚Äù is also appropriate), but *never* ~~Mksh~~ or
somesuch!

*current*: Please remember to subscribe to the mksh
mailing list, either directly or via GMane, if you have an interest
in mksh, such as packaging it. Thanks!

[Building lksh](#compile_lksh), *with*
-DMKSH\_BINSHPOSIX, and installing it alongside mksh,
is now recommended more strongly, as only lksh -o posix is
close to POSIX compliant. The cat and sleep builtins
are gone, so linking either as multi-call binary will now fail; a [portable MirBSD sleep](subprj.htm#sleep) is available to plug
the hole if your system utility lacks sub-second sleep support. Please
update all cached references to our IRC channels, the network we had
been using was obliterated. printf.c updated. The testsuite‚Äôs
default UTF-8 locale is now C.UTF-8 (except on HP/UX where we
know better) so use -U if you don‚Äôt have that. When passing
-DMKSH\_ASSUME\_UTF8={0|1} in CPPFLAGS now also set
HAVE\_SETLOCALE\_CTYPE=0 in the environment as the former used
to imply the latter but is now going to go away with locale tracking.
GNU‚Äôs [sigabbrev\_np(3)](htman/i386/man3/sigabbrev_np.htm), [sigdescr\_np(3)](htman/i386/man3/sigdescr_np.htm) and [strerrordesc\_np(3)](htman/i386/man3/strerrordesc_np.htm) are now
preferred over \_sys\_signame[], \_sys\_siglist[] and
\_sys\_errlist[]/sys\_nerr respectively if present.
**Read [musl-specific notes](mksh_oe.htm#oe_musl)
if building for musl! RUN THE TESTSUITE!** mksh is now tested
upstream with ASan/UBSan but this needs the Build.sh -g
option which enables debug mode whose resulting binaries, due to
arbitrarily limiting e.g. recursion depth (to help fuzzers), shall
*not* be distributed to end users. It is no longer necessary
to run ./test.sh with -f, it is now the default; on
slow systems (way below 1¬†GHz or so) add +f instead. Please
message us if an earlier supported platform no longer works, it may
just need some more portability glue in newer places (check [the mbsd{cc,int}.h
testsuite](https://github.com/MirBSD/int) first if you can). If your OS lacks ssize\_t,
contact me, it needs more generic handling then.
*(unfinished‚Ä¶)*

R59c: Please remember to build and install the HTML FAQ.
Ignore deprecation warnings regarding sys\_errlist and sys\_nerr as
alternatives will be used automatically once these are not available
any more (glibc users). When using GNU coreutils consider patching
dot.mkshrc to drop the -o option from lo.

R59b: Correction: Normally, that link goes from rksh,
or just ship both.

R59: You can install a link from rmksh to mksh
(same for lksh or sh). If necessary, an R58b with the fixes but not the
breaking changes can be spun; contact me if needed.

R58:
*in-tree build of FAQ is broken*, sorry‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbuild out-of-tree or [with
this hotfix](http://www.mirbsd.org/cvs.cgi/src/bin/mksh/Build.sh.diff?r1=1.752;r2=1.753) instead (cause was Build.sh removed mksh.faq‚Ä¶).
GCC‚Äôs LTO support was, as announced, removed. Do *not* build
with LTO if you have GCC as compiler, it has wrong-code generation bugs!
We try to add -fno-lto to CFLAGS if GCC is detected,
since some GNU distributions forcefully enabled LTO by default despite
the bugs and upstream not caring about them. The FAQ is now shipped as
XHTML snippets with the source code; run FAQ2HTML.sh to build
a valid local HTML page, consider installing it

R57: The MKSH\_EARLY\_LOCALE\_TRACKING code was fixed.
The testsuite now checks whether there is actually a controlling tty
available or not and whether it matches what‚Äôs passed for options.
The [vendor patching](#vendorpatching) info was updated.

R56c: SuSE provided a patch to implement medi√¶val-scope
locale tracking (set ¬±U if the POSIX locale variables change within
the shell); this is provided as-is, use with care, and especially
do *not* use it in a system shell (with -o posix, it
throws a warning when triggered, as it invokes non-compliance).

R56b: The offsetof macro of dietlibc and klibc,
which is upstream-buggy, is overridden with GCC 3+ to avoid a warning.

R56: Building with -DMKSH\_ASSUME\_UTF8=0 no longer causes a
known failure in the testsuite. Building with dietlibc or klibc though
causes a warning about offsetof and dynamic ‚Äúcommand‚Äù. You can
now choose which UTF-8 locale to use with test.sh -U.

R55: make repool needs mksh R55‚Äôs bugfix on the host.
OS/2 builds with ‚Äútextmode‚Äù (CR+LF as newline) now need Build.sh -T.
Persistent history is now supported by lksh as well, unless explicitly
disabled. There were some changes related to the build system.

R54: Build.sh now installs both manpages (lksh.1 and
mksh.1) independent of how it‚Äôs called. Several additional compiler
flags are attempted. Porters to Harvey-OS and OS/2 should review
their patches.

R53a: this is a botched R53.

R52c: prepare to review use of set +o.

R52b: nothing of note, but prepare to review all mksh
scripts to ensure they start with export LC\_ALL=C soon.

R52:
Android can define MKSH\_DEFAULT\_PROFILEDIR itself but we don‚Äôt.
We no longer ship the stop alias.

R51: Please review all mksh scripts, such as a skeleton
~/.mkshrc file, for alias safety and security‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin case of
doubt, contact us. The EBCDIC and OS/2 ports are not finished, but
some improvements are already included. CVS snapshots now use ‚Äòj‚Äô ipv
‚Äòi‚Äô making room for one more stable version; after R51, we will release
R53, mostly bugfixes, and roll them all up in R50g.

R50f: If you patch mksh, please do not only update the
version in check.t (twice) and sh.h but now in
mksh.1 as well; thanks!
Please let the mksh developer
team review your .mkshrc files for robustness!

R50e: Better portability; no conflict with system headers
defining a ‚Äútilde‚Äù function; no use of ptrdiff\_t any more.
The old workarounds for static code checkers are gone. NSIG
generation works with GCC 5.

R50d: Nothing to note.

R50c: New HAVE\_ISSETUGID define. The example Debian
/etc/skel/.mkshrc moved. **Security release.** [Details.](permalinks/wlog-10_e20141003-tg.htm)

R50b: test.sh output is now clearer.

R50: test.sh now uses $TMPDIR. If you want
to build without SSP, define HAVE\_CAN\_FSTACKPROTECTORSTRONG in
addition to HAVE\_CAN\_FSTACKPROTECTORALL if you have GCC 4.9+.

R49: There is now generated content at build time; it is known
that this is beyond the capabilities of some shells such as Coherent
/bin/sh. We plan to address this in a later release by rewriting
the relevant parts in C, so that a *host* C compiler will, in
addition to a *target* C compiler, also be required to build mksh.

R48b: Nothing of notewortiness.

R48: We now ship a Windows¬Æ icon; just ignore it if you don‚Äôt
want it. We regularly update dot.mkshrc so you‚Äôd better think
of a way for your users to get those updates.

[older entries](mksh_old.htm#upgrade)

## Download the development version via CVS

You can use [cvs(GNU)](htman/i386/manINFO/cvs.html) to download the development version of [mksh(1)](htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm),
commonly called HEAD (or ‚Äútrunk‚Äù to some). Beware of bugs though we
strive to make it installable (at least on MirBSD ‚ò∫) at all times.

```
% env CVS_RSH=ssh cvs -qd _anoncvs@anoncvs.mirbsd.org:/cvs co -PA mksh
```

You might also want to get the printf.c builtin (choose the [right version](mksh-faq.htm#printf-c)), but this is
optional, strongly discouraged and use it only if you really must:

```
% env CVS_RSH=ssh cvs -qd _anoncvs@anoncvs.mirbsd.org:/cvs co src/usr.bin/printf
```

Installation instructions as [above](#compile), although
the Build.sh options, CPPFLAGS, etc. might have changed a
little in the meantime. In general, you want the following:

```
% cd mksh
% sh Build.sh -r
```

Optionally set CC and other variables, as usual.

### Unofficial git mirror

[github](https://github.com/MirBSD/mksh) (chosen only for
popularity) hosts a read-only, push-only, possibly n≈çn-fastforward,
unofficial git mirror of the mksh source tree. Use at your own risk.

## Users' Upgrade Caveat

This does not necessarily list new features, only these which users
should be aware of for existing scripts.

*current*:
The cat and sleep builtins have been removed. In
restricted shells, HISTFILE is now read-only. *Do not*
rely on the BOM enabling UTF-8 mode or turning on POSIX mode disabling
UTF-8 mode any more, full locale tracking may drop these, and only the
LANG and LC\_*\** variables (and manually running
set ¬±U and that being restored upon returning from Korn-style
functions) determine UTF-8 mode then. (A preview of this change is
already available via Debian bullseye, but more remains to be done.)
The Emacs mode editing command capitalize-word[sic!] was renamed
to capitalise-word (to fix spelling), prev-hist-word to
prev-hist-bigword (consistency with the new bigword commands).
Converting variables imported from the environment to integer will discard
their value if it isn‚Äôt purely numeric, for security reasons (‚Äútaint‚Äù).
The IRC channels moved to a different network. Escaping was improved and
thus, for some characters/bytes, changed. Builtins now error out if they
returned true otherwise but encountered write errors on stdout. Expect
persistent history to require PostgreSQL in the future for reliability.
If an environment variable occurs more than once on shell startup, the
last match used to win; this is changed to the first for consistency
with libc even if this mismatches other duplicate resolution algorithms.
The kill-region editing command used to be bound to ^W
like in Emacs, but ^W is usually taken by WERASE so it
was moved to Esc+^W so users reading the manual page
aren‚Äôt confused about what it does. The caret notation used by bind
changed, see its documentation in the manpage, or the 2021-09-26 IRC
heads-up mesaage, for details. Mapping of raw octets in UTF-8 mode will be
moved from U+EF80‚Ä•U+EFFF to U-001BBB80‚Ä•U-001BBBFF (out of the PUA and past
anything actually occupied by UCS) for R60, when moving from OPTU-16 (UTF-8
and CESU-8) to 21-bit UTF-8. Value substitutions now handle exit
(also set -e, etc.) correctly; function substitutions still don‚Äôt
for AT&T ksh93 compatibility. BOM (byte order mark) handling removed.
A subtle change to the hash algorithm (affects both ${var@#} and
the Lbafh\_\* functions in dot.mkshrc) delivers better performance but no
overall degradation in avalanche / quality; the hashes of anything not a
single byte change from older releases‚Äô, though. lksh LONG\_MIN/-1
now properly raises an implementation-defined signal (SIGFPE on MirBSD)
if the result is >¬†LONG\_MAX. Escape a caret if it is the first
character in a shellglob group [\^a-z] since the unescaped meaning
may be changing to [!a-z] at some point. Read the FAQ and TFM!
dot.mkshrc also adds ~/.local/bin/ to $PATH if
it exists. ulimit options -v and -m now honour
both POSIX‚Äô and NetBSD¬Æ‚Äôs assumptions in all possible cases. /
and ^ are no longer permitted in function names.
*(unfinished‚Ä¶)*

R59c: On Mac OSX 10.4 and up, ulimit -m is now an
alias for ulimit -v, which was the one older versions had (so
pkgsrc¬Æ can use it consistently). Some changes to path normalisation
and here document handling might introduce breakage, but we hope they
only *correct* things ‚òª Also, read the FAQ.

R59b: The output format of set +o changed.

R59: On OS/2 the test/[/[[ builtins now add executable file
extensions to several more checks. The output of some commands changed
adding quoting for re-entry safety. Restricted mode is now enabled if
the shell is called as rmksh, rsh, rlksh, ‚Ä¶. The right-hand side of a
string comparison (=, ==, !=) in [[‚Ä¶]] now uses full Korn Shell extglobs
(breaking, but eliminating the need for many eval). There‚Äôs now
a which function in dot.mkshrc. The global
builtin is gone (use typeset -g from R55+ instead), breaking.

R58:
HISTSIZE is now limited to 65535, as pre-announced for years.
Running set -p interactively in privileged shells obtains the
effective privileges.

R57: Bugfix / rollup release, with only a few changes‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit has
some known bugs; no (known) regressions though.

R56c: Bugfix-only release; some fixes might cause new warnings

R56b: Bugfix-only release

R56: Aliases support ‚Äò.‚Äô, ‚Äò:‚Äô and ‚Äò[‚Äô in names again (though
‚Äú[[‚Äù is still forbidden). POSIX character classes and the BSD [re\_format(7)](htman/i386/man7/re_format.htm)
extensions [[:\<:]] and [[:\>:]] (quoted due to
shell syntax issues) have been added (ASCII/EBCDIC only). Some experimental
changes to the history code might help with the vanishing entries phenomena.
Switching to POSIX mode now disables UTF-8 mode and forces exec
to a PATH search and to use [execve(2)](htman/i386/man2/execve.htm). In dot.mkshrc the
hd\_mksh function to hexdump using builtins is now always available,
and **the default editor selection has changed**: it‚Äôs moved
to near the top of the file and now has a priority list users can change.

R55:
The POSIX declaration utility concept is introduced, which also applies
to commands having variable assignments and redirections preceding them.
wait however does not keep assignments any longer. The new
\builtin utility forwards the declaration utility flag exactly
like command does. The new typeset -g replaces mksh‚Äôs
previous home-grown global builtin, which is now deprecated
and *will* be removed from a future version. Aliases are now
expanded for command, function and value substitutions at parse time
(like for functions, and excepting accent gravis-style substitutions),
and typeset -f output is alias-resistent; furthermore, alias
names are now limited to [A-Za-z0-9\_!%,@], following POSIX,
although a non-leading hyphen-minus is also permitted. print -R
is now (correctly) roughly equivalent to the POSIX mode echo.
The deltas between mksh and lksh, and between normal, POSIX and ‚ÄúSH‚Äù mode,
are now properly documented in the manual pages. The let] hack
is gone. ulimit -a output changed to display the associated flag.
$PATHSEP is now pre-defined to ‚Äò:‚Äô (‚Äò;‚Äô on OS/2). $LINENO
is now incremented better in eval and alias expansions.

R54: Lazy evaluation side effects and set -e-related
error propagation in || and && constructs are
now handled properly.

R53a:
Tilde expansions of parameters (~, ~+, and ~-)
now strip . and .. components from their results. The
sample PS1 in dot.mkshrc was corrected for users whose
home directories are pr√¶ficƒìs of others‚Äô. Rotation operators were renamed
from <<< and >>> to ^< and
^>. var=<< may now be used. Many fixes.

R52c: Prepare to audit all uses of set +o. Handling
of "`\"`" is now considered not a POSIX violation, until this
issue is officially resolved. Our PDF manpages now use the PA4 paper size
enabling printing without the need to scale of crop on both DIN ISO A4 and
USA ‚Äúletter‚Äù paper. The manpages now compile with an older version of the
mdoc macropackage (in use by e.g. Schillix) installed. command -pv
and command -pV now behave POSIX conformant.

R52b: Prepare to audit all scripts to ensure they begin with
export LC\_ALL=C as we‚Äôll implement locale trackiing some day.
Handling of "`\"`" is now again not POSIX-compliant even in
posix mode to unbreak existing code (Austin#1015, mktexlsr).
set -C; :>foo is now race-free. Some bugfixes.

R52: (( ‚Ä¶ )) is now a compound command, which changes
the way I/O redirections work. ${x#~}, ${x/y/z}, etc.
now have tilde expansion enabled. ${x//#y} no longer works, for
anchored patterns use only one slash; quotes are now honoured better in
such expressions, though. alias stop='\kill -STOP' is no longer
defined by default anywhere; source is no longer an alias but a
built-in utility, unbreaking it in some cases; the lksh hack to
remove an alias upon function definition is removed. [issetugid(2)](htman/i386/man2/issetugid.htm) is no
longer used for set ¬±p checks, unbreaking suid in some cases.
Handling of "`\"`" is now POSIX-compliant (this breaks scripts)!
More bugfixes, although there are (sorry!) still some known bugs ‚òπ

R51: Integers with bases outside of the permitted
range are handled as base 10 instead of failing to parse, like ksh93.
Korn shell style functions (function foo {) now have locally
scoped shell options (e.g. set -o noglob) except in lksh. Much
standard code is now protected from being overridden by aliases; the new
enable function in dot.mkshrc can be used to enable or
disable a built-in utility (such as rename) or function (including
those in dot.mkshrc) by means of an alias. The feature to
unalias an identifier when a POSIX-style function with the same
name is defined only persists in lksh, as it is a legacy feature. [cat(1)](htman/i386/man1/cat.htm),
when a flag is given, and [printf(1)](htman/i386/man1/printf.htm), now prefer an external utility over
the builtin reliably. Several bugfixes, such as command -v now
handling shell reserved words, impact compatibility.

R50f: unset HISTFILE actually works. Several more
bugfixes and robustness improvements. The [mksh(1)](htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm) manpage now documents
how to enable/disable the UTF-8 mode based on the current POSIX locale
according to how it‚Äôs done at startup on some OSes.

R50e: **Warning:** do not use x=<<
inside a function, it has never worked.
Lots of POSIX compliance and
bug fixes. New options for the exec builtin.

R50d: Fixed a segfault and a regression in field splitting
breaking update-initramfs. Sorry! Also, added a warning about not using
unchecked user input in arithmetics‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää[[ $x = +([0-9]) ]] || die
is a useful check. We‚Äôll link a more detailed writeup about it later.

R50c: $RANDOM is no longer exported. Field splitting
has improved. This version fixes one security issue of low importance ([details](permalinks/wlog-10_e20141003-tg.htm)) which
is mksh-specific, and mksh is not vulnerable to all those GNU bash bugs,
some of which affect AT&T ksh93 as well.

R50b: nameref can alias $1, etc. again.

R50: Arithmetic expressions are now IFS-split, as per POSIX;
this matches what the manpage always documented. Due to regressions, the
arr=([index]=value) syntax (naming the indicƒìs during setting an
array) is gone for now, and will not reappear in ‚Äúset -A‚Äù, only in the
‚Äú=(‚Ä¶)‚Äù syntax once we get its parsing fixed. Privileges are now dropped
upon start unless the shell is started with ‚Äú-p‚Äù.

R49: The hash algorithm has changed (for, hopefully, the last
time); the old algorithms are gone from dot.mkshrc too, and the
${foo@#} syntax no longer accepts a seed value (for more variety
use the functions from dot.mkshrc; for hash tables, just xor and
rotate the finished stable hash). Some terminal and other issues have been
fixed, don‚Äôt be surprised.

R48b: Bugfix for multi-line prompts.

R48: The ‚Äúdoch‚Äù alias in dot.mkshrc now keeps standard
input usable at the cost of the command to be run being logged by [sudo(8)](htman/i386/man8/sudo.htm).
If you notice anything unusual (regression) in the interactive display code
please report it; sections of that code have been refactored and improved.

  issue in AT&T ksh); honour -o posix for leading-zero as
  octal, though (but continue not in importing array indicƒìs)

  codepath instead of the uncommon one) in code and testsuite
* [tg] EBCDIC: codepage consistency check, diagnostic; document more
* [tg] Plug a couple memory leaks; slightly increase performance

  some cases, including escape sequences for them
* [tg] Improve outputting job information
* [tg] Harmonise some error reporting and use string pooling more
* [tg] Wrap all builtin calls into a check, run if the builtin would exit
  true (zero) otherwise, for stdout write errors; diagnostic and exit false

* [tg] Allow for <sys/select.h> substituting <sys/time.h> if
  both may not be included at the same time (scosysv 3.2r4.2)
* [tg] Elide some configure-time tests on OEs where they are known
* [tg] Not only is [fgrep(1)](htman/i386/man1/fgrep.htm) unportable, but so is [grep(1)](htman/i386/man1/grep.htm) -F‚Ä¶

  normal case, whitelist OSes with reliable [signal(3)](htman/i386/man3/signal.htm) bsd\_signal
* [tg, RT] Xenix has reliable signals but broken [termios(4)](htman/i386/man4/termios.htm); cope
* [tg] Speed up configuring: skip a few checks for ancient compilers
* [RT, tg] Update and promote to working the port to Syllable Desktop;
  improve the situation for LynxOS 3.0 and BeOS 6.2 ‚ÄúZeta‚Äù and, slightly,
  for BeOS 5.1 ‚ÄúDano‚Äù and 5.0 ‚ÄúMaui‚Äù
* [tg] Check whether exec -a newargv0 prog args‚Ä¶ works separately
  so it isn‚Äôt caught through sh-mode-1 indirectly only; split that
* [tg] Begin switching to‚Ä¶ slightly less insane‚Ä¶ integer types
* [RT] Port to SkyOS (fragile), Minoca OS (good)
* [tg] Sanity-check some usual tools before using (build, test)
* [tg, RT, komh] Handle broken-but-extant [getrusage(2)](htman/i386/man2/getrusage.htm)
* [tg] Make [times(3)](htman/i386/man3/times.htm) use work in the absence of CLK\_TCK
* [tg] Actually act on [getrusage(2)](htman/i386/man2/getrusage.htm) and [times(3)](htman/i386/man3/times.htm) errors
* [tg] When tabcompleting, set the mark to the beginning of the
  inserted substring (the cursor is at or just one space past the end),
  similar to how other editing commands behave; for xthechar on IRC
* [tg] When importing env vars, first match now wins, like in libc
* [tg] Exporting parameters to the environment now uses a stable order
* [tg] Move kill-region default binding to Esc+^W
  because ^W is usually taken by WERASE, to unconfuse
* [RT, tg] Work around NeXTstep [cc(1)](htman/i386/man1/cc.htm) more
* [tg] Testsuite: C.UTF-8 is now the default UTF-8 locale on all
  operating systems except HP/UX where it still defaults to en\_US.utf8
  and Darwin (Mac OSX) which uses just UTF-8 for some reason‚ÄΩ
* [tg] Run all tests with LANG=C since musl defaults to C.UTF-8
  if all locale parameters are unset (and talk about Debian glibc to do the
  same exists and I‚Äôm considering this for MirBSD maybe as well)
* [tg] Make base-1 integers pass typeset -p reentry-safe

## Future Plans

* Diagnostics for [signal
  handling](https://upsilon.cc/~zack/teaching/1314/progsyst/cours-05-signals.pdf) will be added soon so we can debug NOPROSPECTOFWORK ports
  better and maybe make those fully workable. More remains to be seen.
* more diagnostics: the extant EBCDIC ones; whether [sigsetjmp(3)](htman/i386/man3/sigsetjmp.htm) properly
  does not ignore the second argument (\*cough\*klibc\*cough\*), etc.
* consider building a diagnostic shell always alongside the normal one,
  with same flags; perhaps, can we also build lksh always as well? (or do
  we want a diagnostic lksh?) for the former we‚Äôd need to always do BINSHPOSIX
  but I doubt everyone wants it even if it probably was good‚Ä¶
* history: fix concurrency with truncation
* ‚Ä¶ possibly make persistent history a PostgreSQL-only feature
* add a pre-exec hook for liwakura
* bind keys of dynamic length ‚Ä£ begun in a branch
* dynamic input LINE length, instead of a hardcoded value at compile time
* cache optimised extglobs (especially for ${foo/bar/baz})
* typed variables; using ${var@?} more (JSON!)
* make arrays use hashtables internally ipv linear linked lists
* associative, multidimensional arrays
* Build with more platforms‚Äô native tools or other compilers
  ‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäACK, kencc, ICC/UWIN, egcs/UWIN
* Build and actually work on more platforms‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDJGPP, PW32,
  Plan 9, Syllable, NuttX‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädebug these
* Bugfix for suspending a && b chain
* ‚Äúprocess substitution‚Äù echo diff <(echo 1) <(echo 2)
* read -e (or something): use the edit.c stuff for inputting
* ‚Üë actually make a libmkshedit, see my mirtoconf v2 plans
* Allow trimming arrays (e.g. ${foo[\*]@Q})
* Array slicing (${foo[2:3]}), combinable with the above
* Add -DMKSH\_BAIKA\_NO\_JUTSU (trade more size for more speed)
* Someone should run mksh through afl and fix everything it finds
* some sort of [mktemp(1)](htman/i386/man1/mktemp.htm) builtin; the functionality is already
  mostly there, but we keep it open already in C and don‚Äôt do dirs,
  this must be rethinked wrt. UI (the UI can also be used for some
  file-based locking builtin)
* [older/unrealistic plans](mksh_old.htm#plans)

* Although there is *definite* need, eventually, to have
  64-bit arithmetics, possibly using a long typeset flag and something
  similar to $((#x)) for unsigned arithmetics
* arbitrary-precision arithmetics?
* The DEBUG trap (although GNU bash also has a RETURN
  trap, and both bash and ksh93 write *lots* about this, so
  careful design is required before attempting this) ‚Üí Ypnose

  Shell-private variable namespaces have their use. Accessors too.
* more interesting or realistic:
* make KSH\_MATCH into an array
* Possibly x=<&0 or $(<&0)
* Can we optimise bracket matches where the bracket content is
  comprised solely of character classes?
* zsh-like ${${foo#bar}%quux} (leah2 via IRC)
* Handle n≈çn-BMP Unicode and \Uxxxxxxxx (Mingye Wang
  via Debian)
* Trim a vector (some unspecified, but in general valid POSuX)
* BASH\_SOURCE, FUNCNAME, BASH\_LINENO, etc. so that we can both
  generate full backtraces and dot-sourced scripts know their name

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
