```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `include()` function in JAF CMS, where the `website` and `main_dir` parameters are used to construct the path to the included file without proper sanitization.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application is vulnerable to remote file inclusion because it directly uses user-supplied input (`website` and `main_dir` parameters) in the `include()` function, allowing an attacker to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server.

Impact of exploitation:
- System access: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete system compromise by allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP GET requests: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious HTTP GET requests containing the `website` or `main_dir` parameters, pointing to a malicious script on a remote server.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable JAF CMS server and have access to a remote server where they can host a malicious script to include.
