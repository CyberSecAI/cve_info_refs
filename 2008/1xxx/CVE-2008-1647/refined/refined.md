Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-1647:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `SaveLastError` method of the ChilkatHttp ActiveX control (version 2.3). This method allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path, which is then overwritten with data related to the "last error".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** The core vulnerability is the ability to overwrite any file on the system accessible to the user running the vulnerable application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** This can lead to various consequences depending on the file overwritten. This could cause denial of service by overwriting system files or configuration files, or it could allow an attacker to achieve code execution by overwriting executable files. The impact could be severe, potentially resulting in system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The provided exploit code suggests the vulnerability can be triggered remotely by embedding the ActiveX control within a web page and using Javascript or VBScript to invoke the vulnerable method. The attacker would need to entice a user to visit a webpage containing the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Web Server/Hosting:** An attacker needs to host a malicious web page containing the exploit code.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the malicious web page and trigger the ActiveX control code. The user also needs to have the vulnerable ActiveX control installed.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit code provided uses VBScript to call the `SaveLastError` method of the ChilkatHttp ActiveX control, specifying the path `c:\windows\system_.ini` to be overwritten.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit specifically targets Windows systems due to the use of a Windows file path (`c:\windows\system_.ini`).
- The Exploit-DB entry includes the vendor's URL which is `www.chilkatsoft.com`.
