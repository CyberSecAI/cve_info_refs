```
- Root cause of vulnerability: SQL injection vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'categ' parameter of the index.php file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries to extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including user credentials (email and password hashes).
- Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL with the `categ` parameter that includes SQL injection payloads
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
