```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `ss_load.php` file of the Spreadsheet WordPress plugin, where the `ss_id` parameter from the GET request is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, allowing them to potentially read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even gain unauthorized access to the system. The example given shows extracting user login credentials.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through a specially crafted GET request to `ss_load.php` with a malicious value for the `ss_id` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
