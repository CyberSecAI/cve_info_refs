  "cve": "CVE-2008-1949",
  "description": "A denial of service vulnerability exists in GnuTLS when handling a specially crafted TLS packet that contains multiple Client Hello messages. The program reads the first Client Hello and then proceeds to send Server Hello, Certificate, Certificate Request and Server Hello Done messages. After sending these, it apparently reads the next Client Hello from the message sent earlier and crashes due to a null pointer dereference.",
  "affected_packages": [
    "gnutls12",
    "gnutls13",
     "net-libs/gnutls"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered by a null pointer dereference when processing multiple Client Hello messages within a single TLS packet.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "A null pointer dereference",
       "Improper handling of multiple Client Hello messages within a single TLS message",
      "Lack of proper input validation or handling of unexpected handshake data"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) of applications using GnuTLS, potentially affecting various network services.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted TLS packet containing multiple Client Hello messages."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a server using the vulnerable GnuTLS library. No authentication is required.",
    "position": "The attacker can be remote."
