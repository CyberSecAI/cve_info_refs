Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A heap buffer overflow exists within the progressive PNG image loader in KHTML. This occurs due to a flaw in how the loader handles specially crafted PNG images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap buffer overflow: The vulnerability allows an attacker to write data beyond the allocated buffer, corrupting adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The overflow can lead to a crash, making the application unusable.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: The vulnerability has the potential for arbitrary code execution within the user's context, if successfully exploited, by overwriting critical memory locations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Loading a specially encoded PNG image: The attack can be triggered by loading a malicious PNG image that has been crafted to exploit the vulnerability. This could occur via a website or any other medium through which a KHTML-based application loads the image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to get the vulnerable application to load their specially crafted PNG image. This may involve the attacker hosting a web page with the malicious image, sending it as an attachment, etc.

**Affected Systems:**
- KHTML as shipped with KDE 4.0 or newer (KDE 3.x is not affected)
- openSUSE 10.3 was specifically mentioned as affected and fixed by a patch.

**Additional Information:**
- A patch is available for KDE 4.0 and newer at `ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security_patches/f31a4bb0429149e27b4436f138eea471 post-kde-4.0.3-khtml.diff`
- The vulnerability was fixed in openSUSE 10.3
