```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in the 'header.inc.php' file. The code uses an include function to include a file specified via the 'root' parameter without proper sanitization.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The main weakness is the usage of `@include($root.'config.php')` with the user-controlled `$root` variable, allowing attackers to include remote files.

- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially gaining full control of the vulnerable server.

- Attack vectors: The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request that includes a malicious URL in the root parameter.

- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and host a malicious file on a server accessible by the vulnerable application.
