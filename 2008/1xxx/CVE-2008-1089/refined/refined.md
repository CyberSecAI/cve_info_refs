Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-1089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper validation of object header data in specially crafted Visio files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Visio handles object header data within Visio files. When opening a specially crafted file, Visio fails to properly validate this data, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve remote code execution on a vulnerable system.
- **Full System Control:** Upon successful exploitation, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Malicious Actions:** This control allows the attacker to:
    - Install programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users with administrative privileges are at higher risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attachments:** An attacker can send a malformed Visio file as an email attachment and convince the user to open it.
- **Web-based attacks:** An attacker can host a malicious Visio file on a website. They would then need to convince users to visit the site, often through links in emails or instant messages. Compromised websites could also host such files.
- The vulnerability requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must create a specially crafted Visio file.
- The attacker needs to get a user to open the malicious file, either through email or by visiting a website.

**Additional details from the Microsoft Security Bulletin:**
- The vulnerability is classified as **Important**.
- Affected software includes Microsoft Visio 2002 SP2, 2003 SP2, 2003 SP3, 2007, and 2007 SP1.
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Visio validates object header data when opening files.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the security bulletin was released.
- There were no reports of exploitation before the release of the security bulletin.
