Insufficient argument validation of hooked SSDT functions
on multiple Antivirus and Firewalls
\*Advisory Information\*
Title: Insufficient argument validation of hooked SSDT functions on
multiple Antivirus and Firewalls
Advisory ID: CORE-2008-0320
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/?action=item&id=2249
Date published: 2008-04-28
Date of last update: 2008-04-28
Vendors contacted: BitDefender, Comodo, Sophos and Rising
Release mode: Coordinated release (BitDefender, Comodo, Rising), User
release (Sophos)
\*Vulnerability Information\*
Class: Invalid memory reference
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
Bugtraq ID: 28741 28742 28743 28744
CVE Name: CVE-2008-1735 CVE-2008-1736 CVE-2008-1737 CVE-2008-1738
\*Vulnerability Description\*
Insufficient argument validation of hooked SSDT functions on multiple
Antivirus and Firewalls (BitDefender Antivirus [1], Comodo Firewall [2],
Sophos Antivirus [3] and Rising Antivirus [4]) have been found that
could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly to code execution
attacks. An attacker, utilizing these flaws, could be able to locally
reboot the whole system shutting down the firewall or anti-virus
protection. However, in some cases it may be possible to extend the
impact of these bugs, and they could lead to the execution of arbitrary
code in the privileged kernel mode.
\*Vulnerable Packages\*
. BitDefender Antivirus 2008 Build 11.0.11
. Comodo Firewall Pro 2.4.18.184
. Sophos Antivirus 7.0.5
. Rising Antivirus 19.60.0.0 and 19.66.0.0
. Older versions may be affected, but were not checked.
\*Non-vulnerable Packages\*
. BitDefender Antivirus 2008 builds available through automatic updates,
posterior to January 18th.
. Comodo Firewall Pro 3.0
. Rising Antivirus 20.38.20
\*Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds\*
1) BITDEFENDER ANTIVIRUS (BID 28741, CVE-2008-1735)
According to BitDefender, the flaw was not exploited by any malicious
application, and it was corrected through automatic updates. Information
on this issue can be found on BitDefender website at this location:
http://kb.bitdefender.com/KB419-en--Security-vulnerability-in-BitDefende
r-2008.html.
2) COMODO FIREWALL PRO (BID 28742, CVE-2008-1736)
The vulnerability is fixed in Comodo Firewall Pro 3.0, available at:
http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/download\_firewall.html
3) SOPHOS ANTIVIRUS (BID 28743, CVE-2008-1737)
Vendor statement:
"Sophos Anti-Virus 7.x for Windows 2000, 2003 and XP is affected by this
vulnerability.
Non-vulnerable products from Sophos are earlier versions of Sophos
Anti-Virus for Windows, Sophos Anti-Virus for non-Windows platforms and
all other Sophos products.
The vulnerability is only exploitable if Runtime Behavioural Analysis is
switched on. Even then the exploit will only be effective if the end
user is using security settings that are lower than the defaults for
most web browsers today, or if the end user agrees to activate an
ActiveX or Java Applet from the webpage hosting the exploit.
Workarounds to avoid this vulnerability include:
a. Using the default security settings or higher on the latest version
of your chosen web browser. In line with general security best practice
we would also encourage end users not to download ActiveX or Java
Applets unless confident about their content.
b. Turning off the Runtime Behavioural Analysis functionality within
Sophos Anti-Virus (customers will still benefit from Sophos Behavioural
Genotype protection and other means of protecting endpoints against
malware).
N.B. Should an exploit be released into the wild, Sophos will deploy
protection against that exploit.
The fix for this vulnerability requires customers to reboot their
endpoints. Given the low severity of the vulnerability, to minimise
disruption to our customers Sophos will release the fix at the earliest
opportunity that coincides with a necessary reboot of the product."
4) RISING ANTIVIRUS (BID 28744, CVE-2008-1738)
A fixed version of Rising Antivirus can be downloaded from:
http://rsdownload.rising.com.cn/for\_down/rsfree/ravolusrfree.exe
All Rising customers can also update up to a patched version through
automatic updates.
\*Credits\*
These vulnerabilities (except the Rising one) were discovered by Damian
Saura, Anibal Sacco, Dario Menichelli, Norberto Kueffner, Andres Blanco
y Rodrigo Carvalho from Core Security Technologies, during Bugweek 2007.
The Rising vulnerability was discovered by Anibal Sacco from Core
Security Technologies exploit writers team.
These vulnerabilities were researched by Anibal Sacco and Damian Saura
from Core Security Technologies.
\*Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code\*
We have found that BitDefender Antivirus, Rising Antivirus, Comodo
Firewall and Sophos Antivirus have hooks that do not properly validate
the arguments of the hooked functions before accessing them, and lead to
the program trying to reference some invalid memory, leading in some
scenarios to a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death).
In our tests we used the kernel hooks probing tool BSODhook [5] in order
to find any kind of insufficient argument validation of hooked SSDT
functions. From Matousec paper [6]:
"Hooking kernel functions by modifying the System Service Descriptor
Table (SSDT) is a very popular method of implementation of additional
security features and is used frequently by personal firewalls and other
security and low-level software. Although undocumented and despised by
Microsoft, this technique can be implemented in a correct and stable
way. However, many software vendors do not follow the rules and
recommendations for kernel-mode code writing and many drivers that
implement SSDT hooking do not properly validate the parameters of the
hooking functions."
"Hooking SSDT functions requires extra caution. SSDT function handlers
are executed in the kernel mode but their callers are executed in the
user mode. Hence all function arguments come from the user mode. This is
why it is necessary to validate these arguments properly. Otherwise a
simple user call can easily crash the whole system. This bug usually
results in a system crash. However, it may happen that this bug is even
more dangerous and may lead to the execution of an arbitrary code in the
privileged kernel mode."
A local DoS attack, despite not being a very sophisticated intrusion
attack, could be used as an accessory under several scenarios. It is
commonly used by viruses as added feature, when the specific AV is
detected on the infected machine, crashing the system just to annoy. Or
by a human attacker, after a succesful remote intrusion with
unprivileged credentials to make a computer resource unavailable to its
intended users. Besides, this could be a very valuable resource when
trying to fake some service that answers broadcasts request like a DHCP,
allowing to start the service in another location replacing the original
one.
1) BITDEFENDER ANTIVIRUS (BID 28741, CVE-2008-1735)
BitDefender fails to validate the pointer to the 'CLIENT\_ID' structure
provided to 'NtOpenProcess'. So, if we pass an invalid pointer, we will
crash the whole system.
/-----------

2) COMODO FIREWALL PRO (BID 28742, CVE-2008-1736)
In Comodo there are problems in the arguments validation of
'NtDeleteFile', 'NtCreateFile' and 'NtSetThreadContext' functions.
'NtDeleteFile' receives just one parameter, a pointer to an
'OBJECT\_ATTRIBUTES' structure. These attributes would include the
'ObjectName' and the 'SECURITY\_DESCRIPTOR', for example. This is the
hook placed by Comodo at 'NtDeleteFile'.
/-----------
NTDeleteFile (POBJECT\_ATTRIBUTES ObjectAttributes)
.text:0001ACB0 push 1Ch
.text:0001ACB2 push offset stru\_1E3F0
.text:0001ACB7 call \_\_SEH\_prolog

.text:0001ACD0 call ds:ExGetPreviousMode
.text:0001ACD6 mov edi, [ebp+ObjectAttributes]
- -----------/
Here it does a lot of 'ProbeForRead' checks to see if the pointers of
the structure are valid. Nice! ('EDI' still has a pointer to the
'OBJECT\_ATTRIBUTES' structure)
/-----------
....
.text:0001AD25 push edi ; ObjectAttributes
.text:0001AD26 call sub\_1A692 ; Here it passes the
OBJECT\_ATTRIBUTES structure pointer to the next function.

.text:0001A6D2 mov edi, [ebp+ObjectAttributes]
.text:0001A6D5 mov eax, [edi+OBJECT\_ATTRIBUTES.RootDirectory] ;

.text:0001A6E0 push 1 ; ObjectInformationClass
; Specifies an OBJECT\_INFORMATION\_CLASS value that determines the type
; of information returned in the ObjectInformation buffer. It's using
; an undocumented type (OBJECT\_NAME\_INFORMATION) which returns an
UNICODE\_STRING structure
.text:0001A6E2 push eax ; ObjectHandle
; Now, the user-controlled handle 'll be used here to identify the
object by ZwQueryObject,
.text:0001A6E3 call ds:ZwQueryObject
.text:0001A6E9 mov [ebp+var\_20], eax
.text:0001A6EC test eax, eax
.text:0001A6EE jl short loc\_1A746
- -----------/
Here is where the problem shows up. The code does not properly validates
the data retrieved by 'ZwQueryObject', expecting an 'UNICODE\_STRING'
structure. But it is possible to make multiple calls to the function
using different handlers to obtain a null structure crashing the system
when the code tries to dereference its 'Buffer' field.
/-----------
.text:0001A6F0 movzx eax, [esi+UNICODE\_STRING.Length]
.text:0001A6F3 shr eax, 1
.text:0001A6F5 mov ecx, [esi+UNICODE\_STRING.Buffer]
.text:0001A6F8 movzx eax, word ptr [ecx+eax\*2-2] ; Here is the problem
.text:0001A6FD mov [ebp+var\_30], eax
.text:0001A700 cmp ax, 5Ch
.text:0001A704 jz short loc\_1A725
- -----------/
3) SOPHOS ANTIVIRUS (BID 28743, CVE-2008-1737)
Insufficient argument validation of hooked SSDT functions on Sophos lead
to a DoS. An attacker, utilizing this flaw, would be able to locally
reboot the whole system shutting down the Firewall or AV protection.
Although neither the vendor nor Core Security has found a means of
exploiting the flaw to execute arbitrary code, it has not been possible
to rule this out.
In Sophos AV there is a problem in the arguments validation of
'NtCreateKey' function.
/-----------
int \_\_cdecl NtCreateKeyHook(PHANDLE pKeyHandle,
ACCESS\_MASK DesiredAccess,
POBJECT\_ATTRIBUTES ObjectAttributes,
ULONG TitleIndex,PUNICODE\_STRING Class,
ULONG CreateOptions,
PULONG Disposition)
[...]
.text:0001C01C push 4 ; Alignment
.text:0001C01E push 18h ; Length
.text:0001C020 mov esi, [ebp+ObjectAttributes]
.text:0001C023 push esi ; Address
.text:0001C024 call ds:ProbeForRead
- -----------/
Here it checks for 'ObjectAttributes' to be pointing to a valid address.
/-----------
.text:0001C02A mov eax, [esi+OBJECT\_ATTRIBUTES.RootDirectory]
.text:0001C02D mov [ebp+Handle], eax
.text:0001C030 mov esi, [esi+OBJECT\_ATTRIBUTES.ObjectName]
.text:0001C033 mov [ebp+pUnicodeString], esi
- -----------/
Now, it gets from 'OBJECT\_ATTRIBUTES' a handle and a pointer to an
'UNICODE\_STRING' structure.
/-----------
.text:0001C095 push 4
.text:0001C097 push 8
.text:0001C099 push esi
.text:0001C09A mov ebx, ds:ProbeForRead
.text:0001C0A0 call ebx ; ProbeForRead, it checks the
pointer before the dereference.
.text:0001C0A2 mov eax, dword ptr [esi+UNICODE\_STRING.Length]
.text:0001C0A4 mov dword ptr [ebp+stUnicodeString.Length], eax
.text:0001C0A7 mov esi, [esi+UNICODE\_STRING.Buffer] ; And gets
from the UNICODE\_STRING structure
; a pointer to the unicode buffer.
.text:0001C0AA mov [ebp+stUnicodeString.Buffer], esi
.text:0001C0AD push 2 ; Alignment
.text:0001C0AF shr eax, 10h
.text:0001C0B2 push eax ; Length
.text:0001C0B3 push esi ; Address
.text:0001C0B4 call ebx ; ProbeForRead
- -----------/
It does the check, but here is the problem
/-----------
.text:0001C0B6 push gdwValue
.text:0001C0BC lea eax, [ebp+stUnicodeString]
.text:0001C0BF push eax
.text:0001C0C0 push [ebp+Object]
.text:0001C0C3 call sub\_1cb40
- -----------/
The problem relies in the function not properly checking the 'Length'
field of the 'UNICODE\_STRING' structure. When doing the check,
'ProbeForRead' receives the length field of the structure as a parameter
without any kind of validation.
So, if we set this field to 0, 'ProbeForRead' will not raise any
exception even though we were passing it an invalid address. And it will
crash when trying to access to the desired invalid memory.
/-----------
sub\_1cb40
[...]
.text:0001CB5E xor esi, esi
.text:0001CB60 mov [ebp+ms\_exc.disabled], esi
.text:0001CB63 mov edi, [ebp+pUnicodeString]
.text:0001CB66 mov eax, [edi+UNICODE\_STRING.Buffer]
- -----------/
And here is where it will crash:
/-----------
.text:0001CB69 cmp word ptr [eax], '' ; Reference the first
pointed byte
- -----------/
4) RISING ANTIVIRUS (BID 28744, CVE-2008-1738)
In Rising antivirus the code of the 'NtOpenProcess' hook does not
validates if the pointer to the structure
/-----------
typedef struct \_CLIENT\_ID {
HANDLE UniqueProcess;
HANDLE UniqueThread;}
- -----------/
is really pointing to mapped memory. So, when the code tries to
dereference the pointer to check the 'CLIENT\_ID->UniqueProcess' value,
if it is pointing to invalid memory, will crash.
/-----------
NtOpenProcess( OUT PHANDLE ProcessHandle,
IN ACCESS\_MASK AccessMask,
IN POBJECT\_ATTRIBUTES ObjectAttributes,
IN PCLIENT\_ID ClientId )
.text:00010EAA push ebp
.text:00010EAB mov ebp, esp

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
