```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows local file inclusion through the 'skin' parameter in `index.php` and `install.php`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include local files on the server, potentially accessing sensitive information such as configuration files (e.g., `config.php`).",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with the 'skin' parameter, pointing to a local file with directory traversal (e.g., `/../config.php`) and a null byte (%00).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and must be aware of the application's file structure to successfully perform the LFI."
