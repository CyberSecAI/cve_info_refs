Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-1908:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `calendar.php` script, specifically the `month`, `date`, and `year` parameters, before reflecting it in the HTML output.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application fails to properly validate the `language` and `action` parameters before using them to include files, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the local filesystem.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XSS:**  Lack of input sanitization leads to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts into the web page.
*   **LFI:** Lack of input validation for file inclusion allows attackers to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially including sensitive configuration files, source code, or other confidential information.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of malicious JavaScript code within a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement.
*   **LFI:** Successful exploitation can enable attackers to access and read sensitive files from the server.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and tricks a user into visiting it (e.g., through social engineering, phishing).
*   **LFI:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the path to a file on the server they want to include.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to get a victim to click on a malicious link, either directly or through a social engineering attack. The attacker does not need direct access to the server.
*   **LFI:** The attacker does not need direct access to the server and can access the vulnerabilities remotely via crafted requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Exploit-DB entry also mentions SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the `display_page.func.php` which are not related to CVE-2008-1908
*   The vulnerable application is CPCommerce 1.1.0.
*   The identified vulnerabilities were found by AmnPardaz Security Research Team.
