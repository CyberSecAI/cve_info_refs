How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

SUSE Security Summary Report
Announcement ID: SUSE-SR:2008:009
Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2008 15:00:00 +0000
Cross-References: CVE-2008-1483, CVE-2008-1657
Content of this advisory:
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities:
- openssh X access leakage and ForceCommand bypass
- opera 9.27 security update
2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds:
None listed this week.
3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenSSH X access leakage and ForceCommand bypass
OpenSSH was updated to fix two security problems potentially
exploitable by local users.
- A flaw in the X forwarding code of openssh allowed local
malicious users to steal the X access credentials of other users
(CVE-2008-1483).
- Due to another flaw users could bypass the option "ForceCommand"
(CVE-2008-1657).
- Opera 9.27 security update
The web-browser Opera was updated to version 9.27 to fix various
security issues.
A flaw in the image processing routines could crash opera. Attackers could
potentially even exploit that to execute code.
Opera was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
None listed this week.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

The information in this advisory may be distributed or reproduced,
provided that the advisory is not modified in any way. In particular, the
clear text signature should show proof of the authenticity of the text.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

FreeBSD-SA-08:05.openssh Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: OpenSSH X11-forwarding privilege escalation
Category: contrib
Module: openssh
Announced: 2008-04-17
Credits: Timo Juhani Lindfors
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD
Corrected: 2008-04-16 23:58:33 UTC (RELENG\_7, 7.0-STABLE)
2008-04-16 23:58:52 UTC (RELENG\_7\_0, 7.0-RELEASE-p1)

2008-04-17 00:00:54 UTC (RELENG\_5\_5, 5.5-RELEASE-p20)
CVE Name: CVE-2008-1483
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
OpenSSH is an implementation of the SSH protocol suite, providing an
encrypted and authenticated transport for a variety of services,
including remote shell access. The OpenSSH server daemon (sshd)
provides support for the X11 protocol by binding to a port on the
server and forwarding any connections which are made to that port.
II. Problem Description
When logging in via SSH with X11-forwarding enabled, sshd(8) fails to
correctly handle the case where it fails to bind to an IPv4 port but
successfully binds to an IPv6 port. In this case, applications which
use X11 will connect to the IPv4 port, even though it had not been
bound by sshd(8) and is therefore not being securely forwarded.
III. Impact
A malicious user could listen for X11 connections on a unused IPv4
port, e.g tcp port 6010. When an unaware user logs in and sets up X11
fowarding the malicious user can capture all X11 data send over the
port, potentially disclosing sensitive information or allowing the
execution of commands with the privileges of the user using the
X11 forwarding.
NOTE WELL: FreeBSD ships with IPv6 enabled by default in the GENERIC
and SMP kernels, so users are vulnerable even they have not explicitly
enabled IPv6 networking.
IV. Workaround
Disable support for IPv6 in the sshd(8) daemon by setting the option
"AddressFamily inet" in /etc/ssh/sshd\_config.
Disable support for X11 forwarding in the sshd(8) daemon by setting
the option "X11Forwarding no" in /etc/ssh/sshd\_config.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 5-STABLE, 6-STABLE, or 7-STABLE,
or to the RELENG\_7\_0, RELENG\_6\_3, RELENG\_6\_2, RELENG\_6\_1, RELENG\_5\_5
security branch dated after the correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 5.5, 6.1,
6.2, 6.3, and 7.0 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:05/openssh.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:05/openssh.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/secure/lib/libssh
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# cd /usr/src/secure/usr.sbin/sshd
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# /etc/rc.d/sshd restart

# OpenSSH: Privilege escalation — GLSA **200804-03**

Two flaws have been discovered in OpenSSH which could allow local attackers
to escalate their privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/openssh** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.7\_p1-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.7\_p1-r6** |

### Background

OpenSSH is a complete SSH protocol implementation that includes an SFTP
client and server support.

### Description

Two issues have been discovered in OpenSSH:

* Timo Juhani
  Lindfors discovered that OpenSSH sets the DISPLAY variable in SSH
  sessions using X11 forwarding even when it cannot bind the X11 server
  to a local port in all address families (CVE-2008-1483).
* OpenSSH will execute the contents of the ".ssh/rc" file even when
  the "ForceCommand" directive is enabled in the global sshd\_config
  (CVE-2008-1657).

### Impact

A local attacker could exploit the first vulnerability to hijack
forwarded X11 sessions of other users and possibly execute code with
their privileges, disclose sensitive data or cause a Denial of Service,
by binding a local X11 server to a port using only one address family.
The second vulnerability might allow local attackers to bypass intended
security restrictions and execute commands other than those specified
by "ForceCommand" if they are able to write to their home directory.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSH users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/openssh-4.7_p1-r6"
```

Subject: ssh: unprivileged users may hijack forwarded X connections by listening on
port 6010
Date: Mon, 28 Jan 2008 23:40:27 +0200
```
Package: ssh
Version: 1:4.3p2-9
Severity: normal
Tags: security

Steps to reproduce:
1) Malice logs to multiuser.example.com
2) Malice runs netcat -l -p 6010 -v -v
3) Alice logs to multuser.example.com and uses X11 forwarding (-X)
4) Alice starts emacs on the remote system (with X forwarding)

Expected results:
3) ssh sets DISPLAY to :11 since :10 would make emacs talk to Malice's
netcat.
4) emacs (xlib) sends MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE to $DISPLAY and Malice can't
see it.

Actual results:
3) ssh fails to listen on port 6010 with ipv4 localhost but does not
try other ports when it can listen using ipv6:

$ sudo netstat -alpn | grep 6010
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:6010            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     27820/netcat
tcp6       0      0 ::1:6010                :::*                    LISTEN     27823/15

Then ssh sets DISPLAY to ":10" without telling anybody that it is
actually listening only ipv6 and that malice controls the ipv4 port.

4) emacs (xlib) sends MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE to 127.0.0.1:6010 and malice's
   netcat can see it:

listening on [any] 6010 ...
connect to [127.0.0.1] from localhost [127.0.0.1] 58986
lMIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1...

More info:
1) It seems that specifying "AddressFamily inet" avoids the problem.

2) Easiest way to exploit this is to run "vncserver :10" and allow
anybody to connect to it. When alice starts her emacs it will open its
window to Malice's VNC server and Malice can type M-x shell to run
shell commands with privileges of alice. In fact, I initially hit this
bug when the number of VNC users reached 11 and :10 was no longer
available for ssh causing mysterious failures.

Hi!

According to our OpenSSH maintainer, this issue was fixed in
RHEL / Fedora packages few years ago without realizing security
consequences of this bug.  You may want to check following patch:

<http://cvs.fedora.redhat.com/viewcvs/rpms/openssh/devel/openssh-3.9p1-skip-used.patch?rev=1.1&view=markup>

which should address this problem.

thanks

I just tested this using client versions packaged in Debian Sid and
Ubuntu Gutsy, and it worked as described on both. DISPLAY was set to
:10, even though another process was already listening on the relevant
port. However, step 2 of the reproduction recipe should have the
command as "netcat -l 6010 -vv" - the '-p' flag is an error.

As noted in the control section, I have forwarded this to Theo
DeRaadt, the point of contact for security issues found in OpenBSD's
software.

I hope to see this fixed soon. Keep up the great packaging work!

Subject: different netcat versions, way to passively eavesdrop
Date: Sat, 09 Feb 2008 23:51:08 +0200
```
Hi,

I guess there are different netcat versions around. "nc -l -p 6010 -v
-v" definitely works here and "man netcat" says

"nc -l -p port [-options] [hostname] [port]"

I also now realized that if Malice forwards the data to the ipv6 port
she can completely passively eavesdrop everything alice does. This can be
done with something like

strace -f -o strace.out -s 4096 socat TCP-LISTEN:6010,fork,reuseaddr TCP6:ip6-localhost:6010

and looking at strace.out (I'm sure there's some easier way to log
traffic with socat but couldn't find it yet).

best regards,
Timo Lindfors

```

Thanks, and sorry I've taken so long to address this. This patch seems
like the right answer to me, and will be in my next Debian upload. Do
you know whether it's been forwarded upstream yet?

Hi,

would this bug also warrant a security update for etch?

That would seem reasonable, but I'm about to go on holiday for a while
and won't have time to look at it until I get back. In case somebody on
the security team would like to do this, the patch is attached to the
bug:

  <http://cvs.fedora.redhat.com/viewcvs/rpms/openssh/devel/openssh-3.9p1-skip-used.patch?rev=1.1&view=markup>

Thanks,

My apologies for this; after having been in a very busy period at work
for some time, I was dealing with the bug in a rush immediately before
going on holiday for a week, and a comment on the bug by that point
indicated that it had already been forwarded to Theo DeRaadt. Since that
sounded vaguely reasonable and I was short on time, I didn't think to
check further.

(The bug log indicates that a member of Red Hat's Security Response Team
was also aware of the same problem.)

Hello,

I would like to second this request that a security update be put in place
for etch.  While I was not able to actually "shoulder surf" a forwarded X
application, the bug does seem to stop X apps from running remotely when
the conditions are met, (netcat or VNC) so it might technically qualify as
a DOS attack.

Also this bug is in the list of vulnerabilities that Scanners catch now so
I'm getting pressure to address it on our Stable systems... I'd much
rather do it the debian way via a package from security.

Is there any idea if or when the update will occur?

Thanks!!

I've posted a copy of the message I sent to Theo on February 3 at
<<http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~pmiller/openssh-report>>.
The instruction of where to submit a report was found at
<<http://www.openbsd.org/security.html>>
which may not have been the fastest means of contact, in retrospect,
but should have evoked a much quicker response than it did. Given
that, I would be inclined to ask if there was a problem in that
message's delivery, if someone with the means to check feels like
doing so.

Well, I never saw it.

I came back from NZ to about 8000 pieces of mail.  But I don't
think it was even in my mailbox, because I scan quite carefully.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1576-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Florian Weimer
May 14, 2008                          <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>

Package        : openssh
Vulnerability  : predictable random number generator
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: yes
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0166

The recently announced vulnerability in Debian's openssl package
(DSA-1571-1, CVE-2008-0166) indirectly affects OpenSSH.  As a result,
all user and host keys generated using broken versions of the openssl
package must be considered untrustworthy, even after the openssl update
has been applied.

1. Install the security updates

   This update contains a dependency on the openssl update and will
   automatically install a corrected version of the libss0.9.8 package,
   and a new package openssh-blacklist.

   Once the update is applied, weak user keys will be automatically
   rejected where possible (though they cannot be detected in all
   cases).  If you are using such keys for user authentication, they
   will immediately stop working and will need to be replaced (see
   step 3).

   OpenSSH host keys can be automatically regenerated when the OpenSSH
   security update is applied.  The update will prompt for confirmation
   before taking this step.

2. Update OpenSSH known_hosts files

   The regeneration of host keys will cause a warning to be displayed when
   connecting to the system using SSH until the host key is updated in the
   known_hosts file.  The warning will look like this:

   @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
   @    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
   @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
   IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
   Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
   It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.

   In this case, the host key has simply been changed, and you should update
   the relevant known_hosts file as indicated in the error message.

   It is recommended that you use a trustworthy channel to exchange the
   server key.  It is found in the file /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub on
   the server; it's fingerprint can be printed using the command:

      ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub

   In addition to user-specific known_hosts files, there may be a
   system-wide known hosts file /etc/ssh/known_hosts.  This is file is
   used both by the ssh client and by sshd for the hosts.equiv
   functionality.  This file needs to be updated as well.

3. Check all OpenSSH user keys

   The safest course of action is to regenerate all OpenSSH user keys,
   except where it can be established to a high degree of certainty that the
   key was generated on an unaffected system.

   Check whether your key is affected by running the ssh-vulnkey tool, included
   in the security update.  By default, ssh-vulnkey will check the standard
   location for user keys (~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa and ~/.ssh/identity),
   your authorized_keys file (~/.ssh/authorized_keys and
   ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2), and the system's host keys
   (/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key and /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key).

   To check all your own keys, assuming they are in the standard
   locations (~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, or ~/.ssh/identity):

     ssh-vulnkey

   To check all keys on your system:

     sudo ssh-vulnkey -a

   To check a key in a non-standard location:

     ssh-vulnkey /path/to/key

   If ssh-vulnkey says "Unknown (no blacklist information)", then it has no
   information about whether that key is affected.  In this case, you
   can examine the modification time (mtime) of the file using "ls -l".
   Keys generated before September 2006 are not affected.  Keep in mind
   that, although unlikely, backup procedures may have changed the file
   date back in time (or the system clock may have been incorrectly
   set).

   If in doubt, generate a new key and remove the old one from any
   servers.

4. Regenerate any affected user keys

   OpenSSH keys used for user authentication must be manually regenerated,
   including those which may have since been transferred to a different system
   after being generated.

   New keys can be generated using ssh-keygen, e.g.:

   $ ssh-keygen
   Generating public/private rsa key pair.
   Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
   Enter same passphrase again:
   Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.
   Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
   The key fingerprint is:
   00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 user@host

5. Update authorized_keys files (if necessary)

   Once the user keys have been regenerated, the relevant public keys
   must be propagated to any authorized_keys files (and authorized_keys2
   files, if applicable) on remote systems.  Be sure to delete the lines
   containing old keys from those files..

In addition to countermeasures to mitigate the randomness vulnerability,
this OpenSSH update fixes several other vulnerabilities:

CVE-2008-1483:
   Timo Juhani Lindfors discovered that, when using X11 forwarding, the
   SSH client selects an X11 forwarding port without ensuring that it
   can be bound on all address families. If the system is configured
   with IPv6 (even if it does not have working IPv6 connectivity), this
   could allow a local attacker on the remote server to hijack X11
   forwarding.

CVE-2007-4752:
   Jan Pechanec discovered that ssh fails back to creating a trusted X11
   cookie if creating an untrusted cookie fails, potentially exposing
   the local display to a malicious remote server when using X11
   forwarding.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3p2-9etch1.  Currently, only a subset of all supported
architectures have been built; further updates will be provided when
they become available.

For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 4.7p1-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages and take the
measures indicated above.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

[Slackware](http://www.slackware.org/)

# Slackware

The story of Slackware is pretty darn interesting, when you start to dig a little deeper. Perhaps the most compelling element to the narrative is its longevity. Some twenty-five years after it was first released to the world, Slackware is indeed still going strong. It remains a preferred Linux distribution method by many. As of this writing, it is also still being updated at a decently steady pace.

If you’re just starting to learn about Linux distribution options, you will hear about Slackware a lot. There are several reasons as to why that is the case.

An Introduction To Slackware
In order to better appreciate the longevity of Slackware, we have to cover two major subjects. First, let’s take a quick at the history of Slackware. That begins in 1993, although work began on it even earlier than that. With this foundation, we can then move on to the benefits of Slackware. These are benefits that have remained consistent through the decades. They can go a long way towards explaining the appeal of Slackware in 2019.

As of this year, Slackware is the longest-standing Linux distribution choice that is still being updated.

A Brief History Of Slackware
Working from an even older Linux distribution known as Softlanding Linux, Patrick Volkerding created Slackware in 1993. It was released to the world at large in April of that year, and it has been well-regarded and updated ever since. One of the main purposes for the creation of Slackware in the first place was to establish the most Unix-like distribution option for Linux. Many believe they have succeeded in this regard time and time again.

Both stability and simplicity in design have always been the goals of Slackware. According to Scott Chow of [Theblogstarter.com](https://www.theblogstarter.com), Slackware continues to aspire to make as few changes as humanly possible to software packages that come from the upstream. Furthermore, it also tries to avoid anticipating use cases, or precluding the decisions of the user. There is nothing in the way of a graphical procedure for installation. You also won’t find automatic dependency resolutions for any given software package. It utilizes plain text files, and utilizes a small set of shell scripts, when it comes to configuration and administration. Booting it will take you to an environment of what can be described as a common-line interface.

Slackware has been updated a few times throughout the years. Volkerding continues to spearhead these updates, which is perhaps why Slackware has maintained such impressive consistency from 1993 to the present. The most recent update was released in June of 2016—just two years ago.

As we get ready for a more detailed look at the benefits of Slackware, let’s take a quick look at some of the main Slackware features you can expect.

Slackware Features
One of the great things about Slackware is that it covers a lot of different needs right out of the gate. It is designed in such a way that you should be able to start working with it pretty quickly, and that would be regardless of your level of experience.

We won’t cover every single Slackware feature here, but let’s unpack some of the top things to expect:

• X-Window Systems
• Developmental environments for both C and C++
• The ability to use Perl
• Various utilities related to networking
• A server for mail
• A server for the web
• A server for FTP-related needs
• GNU Image Manipulation capabilities

As you can see, Slackware brings a lot to the table from the beginning. That is certainly an impressive benefit unto itself, but there are so many other potential advantages of using Slackware to keep in mind.

Slackware Benefits Explained
Ultimately, it is obviously up to you to decide if Slackware is right for your needs. The great thing about Slackware is that you will know the answer to that almost immediately. Many find it to be a straightforward collection of features that they can engage immediately. Others see management and administration of Slackware as being riddled with tedious challenges and time-consuming requirements.

For now, let’s explore some of the most commonly-cited benefits of using Slackware for Linux:

• Stability: Even the people who find Slackware to be too challenging will tell you that it at least benefits from being enormously stable. Over the course of the past twenty-five years, Slackware has continued to function without a whole lot of problems. It has moved nicely with the times, but it really hasn’t changed all that much. Few things related to computers have such stability.
• Security: Even for Linux distributions, there are traps and pitfalls that need to be constantly kept in mind. By and large, Slackware doesn’t have that problem. It probably helps that new versions of Slackware do not come out until everything is absolutely ready.
• Neutral: Remember that Slackware isn’t dependent upon a package manager. This is largely due to the fact that the applications are installed through a source. Slackware is not affiliated with any company either. Distribution was community-driven in the early 90s, and Slackware remains committed to that a quarter of a century later.
• Speediness: Another thing to keep in mind with Slackware is that it will only install what you absolutely want. Because of this, and keeping in mind the release policy we mentioned above, Slackware tends to run the fastest of the Linux distributions.
• Clean configuration: One of the big knocks against Slackware is that it doesn’t have graphical config utilities. No matter what you want to do, you are going to need to use the command line. Some people find this frustrating, but others would argue that this gives you the cleanest possible config files to work with.
• Want to understand Linux: There are other benefits to Slackware, but this one might just be our favorite. Even if you initially think Slackware has a higher learning curve than other distributions, there is a strong argument to be made that it will be worth the extra effort. Some don’t even experience this extra effort. However, if you do, think about Linux in broader terms. If you need to have a comprehensive understanding of Linux, you really can’t ask for a better teacher than Slackware. When you’ve mastered everything there is to know about Slackware, you will have pretty much mastered using Linux, as well.

Conclusion
Slackbuilds and strong IT cred are two more benefits that are worth taking to heart. At the end of the day, nothing in the world of Linux distributions can exist without a certain measure of controversy and disagreement. People also tend to be fiercely passionate and loyal about their favorite distribution. Nonetheless, Slackware has a staying power that would be absurd to ignore. It has worked for an incredibly long time, and it has done so in a field that has little time or patience for things that can’t be intensely/comprehensively useful. You could certainly make the argument that it has done more for bringing people to the world of Linux than just about anything else.

Is Slackware right for you? At this point, you are in the best position possible to make that determination. As we mentioned before, Slackware is best experienced in a hands-on capacity. You can research the subject to death, and you still won’t really know for sure. The only thing we can promise you, as we mentioned before, is that you are going to be able to decide how you feel about Slackware pretty quickly. It could be one of the best decisions you have ever made, in terms of working with a distribution that helps you meet your goals.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
