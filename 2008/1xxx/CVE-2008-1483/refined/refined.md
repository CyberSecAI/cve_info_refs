{
  "Root cause": "OpenSSH X11 forwarding fails to correctly handle cases where binding to an IPv4 port fails but binding to an IPv6 port succeeds.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Insecure handling of X11 forwarding when IPv4 binding fails",
    "Failure to validate that the chosen X11 forwarding port is bound on all address families (both IPv4 and IPv6)"
  ],
  "Impact": "A local attacker can hijack forwarded X11 sessions, potentially leading to:\n\t* Code execution with the privileges of the user using the X11 forwarding\n\t* Disclosure of sensitive information\n\t* Denial of service (by intercepting X11 traffic)",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Local attacker on the server",
    "Listening for X11 connections on an unused IPv4 port"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the vulnerable server and be able to listen on an IPv4 port that the sshd process fails to bind to."
