- The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP GET requests.
- The attacker crafts a URL that includes a malicious URL in the `base_dir` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance.
- The attacker needs to have access to a server where the malicious code resides.
- No special user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable component is identified as "com_onlineflashquiz version 1.0.2".
- The vulnerable file path is  `component/com_onlineflashquiz/quiz/common/db_config.inc.php`.
