## Integer Overflow in IPP Service Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1446

A remote code execution vulnerability exists on Windows systems running Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) with the Windows Internet Printing service enabled. This issue could allow a remote, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-1446](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1446).

#### Mitigating Factors for Integer Overflow in IPP Service Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1446

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is enabled by default on IIS for Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows XP. However, the default file permissions across all platforms are set so that IPP can only be accessed by users in the "Authenticated" group. Because of this restriction, unauthenticated users by default will not have the necessary folder permissions to exploit this vulnerability remotely.
* Installations of IIS on Windows Server 2003 are not vulnerable in their default configuration. Only Windows Server 2003 installations that have enabled the Internet Printing Protocol ISAPI filter within IIS are vulnerable. Both the Internet Printing and Active Server Pages components are necessary to enable Web-based printer management and Internet printing. If Active Server Pages component is set to "Allowed" and Internet Printing component is set to "Prohibited," only Web-based printer management is enabled. Users cannot connect to any shared printers through Internet Printing.
* Installations of IIS on Windows Server 2008 are not vulnerable by default. A computer running Windows Server 2008 can act as a client computer that uses Internet printing. Users of the computer who make print requests must be authenticated by the print server, however, before they can use any of the printers connected to that server. To enable a computer running Windows Server 2008 to act as a server supporting Internet printing, you must install the Web Server (IIS) role, the Print Services role, and the Internet Printing role service in the Print Services role.
* Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that the IIS server communicate outbound to a malicious computer on port 445. Administrators who block outbound SMB connections from their IIS server to the Internet can prevent exploitation of this vulnerability from untrusted systems.

#### Workarounds for Integer Overflow in IPP Service Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1446

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable the IPP Service**

  To disable IPP Service in IIS 5.0 and IIS 5.1

  1. Open **Internet Services Manager**.
  2. Right-click the **Default Website** and choose **Properties**.
  3. Go to the **Home Directory** tab and select **Configuration**.
  4. Scroll down to find the **.printer** extension and the corresponding path to **msw3prt.dll**.
  5. Click **Remove**.
  6. Click **OK**.
  7. Restart the IIS Service.

  **Note** Internet Printing can be configured via group policy as well as via the Internet Services Manager. If there is a conflict between the group policy settings and those in the Internet Service Manager, the group policy settings take precedence. If you remove Internet Printing via the Internet Services Manager, be sure to verify that it wonât be re-enabled by either local or domain group policies. (The default group policy neither enables nor disables Internet Printing.) In the MMC Group Policy snap-in, check Computer Configuration | Administrative Templates | Printing |Web-based Printing.

  6. In the field marked **Executable**, input the following:

     %systemroot%\system32\msw3prt.dll
  7. In the field marked **Extension**, input the following:

     .printer
  8. In the field marked **Limit to**, input the following:

     GET,POST
  9. Once this is complete, restart the IIS service.

  To enable IPP Service in IIS 6.0

  1. Start **IIS Manager** or the **IIS snap-in**.
  2. Expand **\* server\_name**, where server\_name is the name of the server.
  3. Click **Web Service Extensions**.
  4. On the right pane, click **Internet Printing**, and then click **Allow**.
  5. Quit IIS Manager.

  To enable IPP Service in IIS 7.0

  1. If **ServerManager** is not running, click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Server Manager**. (If the **User Account Control** dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click **Continue**.)
  2. Expand the Roles node, and then right-click **Print Services** and select **Add Role Services**.
  3. The Add Role Services wizard will appear. Check the **Internet Printing** option, click **Next**, and then **Install** to complete the wizard.
* **Run the IIS Lockdown Tool 2.1**

  On Microsoft Windows 2000 running IIS 5.0 or Windows XP running IIS 5.1, the IIS Lockdown Wizard version 2.1 can be used to disable unnecessary features, including Internet Printing. To run this wizard, complete the following actions:

  1. Download the IIS Lockdown Tool 2.1 from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=dde9efc0-bb30-47eb-9a61-fd755d23cdec&displaylang;=en).
  2. Do one of the following:

     To start the installation immediately, click **Open** or **Run this program from its current location**.

     To copy the download to your computer for installation at a later time, click **Save** or **Save this program to disk**.

  **Impact of Workaround.**

  Users will not be able to connect to any shared printers through Internet Printing. Additionally, the IIS Lockdown tool Users will not be able to connect to any shared printers through Internet Printing. For a complete list of changes made by the IIS Lockdown tool, see the following [MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa302365.aspx).

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To undo the changes made by IIS Lockdown, run **IISlockd.exe** a second time and choose to undo the changes. The undo operation restores the system settings that were in effect immediately before you previously ran IISLockdown. These details are contained in the log file \WINNT\System32\inetsrv\0blt-log. Therefore, it is important that you test the system promptly after you run IISLockdown. If an undo is required, perform it immediately.

  **Note** The URLScan ISAPI filter that is installed as part of IIS Lockdown is not removed as part of the undo process. You can remove URLScan manually by using the ISAPI filters tab at the server level in Internet Services Manager.

#### FAQ for Integer Overflow in IPP Service Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1446

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) function is implemented as an ISAPI extension for IIS. There exists a remote, authenticated vulnerability in the Microsoft implementation of IPP on Windows servers running IIS. An integer overflow exists in the IPP implementation that could allow an authenticated attacker to perform remote code execution on affected IIS servers.

**What is ISAPI?**

ISAPI (Internet Services Application Programming Interface) is a technology that enables web developers to extend the functionality of their web servers by writing custom code that provides new services for a web server. The custom code can either be implemented in an ISAPI filter, if the new functionality provides a low-level service, or an ISAPI extension, if the new functionality provides a high-level service. In this case, the affected code is an ISAPI extension.

**What's the ISAPI extension at issue here?**

The affected ISAPI extension is one that implements the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP), an industry standard defined in RFCs 2910 and 2911. IPP provides a way to request printing services and learn the status of print jobs across the Internet via HTTP. For instance, using IPP, a traveling user could send a print job across the Internet, to be printed on a printer on his corporate network. The user could also find out whether the print request had completed without error.

Microsoft Windows 2000 introduced native support for Internet Printing. The Microsoft Windows 2000 implementation enables users to print directly to an URL, and to view information about print jobs via their browsers. Support for Internet Printing is enabled by default in Microsoft Windows 2000 Server versions. It can also be installed as an optional component on Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2008.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code on a userâs system with system privileges. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to a vulnerable web server that would cause the server to connect to a machine controlled by the attacker acting as a printer using IPP. The attacker would then use specially crafted responses to perform remote code execution on the target server.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and servers running IIS with the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) service enabled are primarily at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

This security update addresses this vulnerability by validating the data received from remote machines within the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) service.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes, Microsoft is aware of targeted attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability. However, Microsoft had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

## Microsoft Windows Internet Printing Protocol service integer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#793233

Original Release Date: 2008-10-15 | Last Revised: 2008-10-27

---

### Overview

The Microsoft Windows Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) service contains an integer overflow vulnerability, which can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| [IPP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms817904.aspx) is an IP-based network protocol that allows remote printing and printer management. On Windows 2000 and XP, IIS comes with IPP enabled by default. IPP is optional on Windows 2003 systems. IPP by default is configured to only allow authenticated users; however, it may be configured to allow unauthenticated connections.  The Microsoft Windows IPP component, which is provided by msw3prt.dll, contains an integer overflow vulnerability that results in an overflow of heap memory. By creating a specific HTTP POST to the vulnerable server, the IPP server will attempt to make an SMB connection to a printer that is specified by the attacker. If this printer returns a malformed [JOB\_INFO\_2](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms535671%28VS.85%29.aspx) structure, the integer overflow vulnerability in IPP may be triggered, resulting in a four-byte memory overwrite and eventually code execution on the IPP server.This vulnerability is being exploited in the wild. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By making a specially crafted request to an IPP server, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable IPP server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS08-062](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-062.mspx). Additional workarounds are provided in the bulletin as well. |
| --- |

| **Block outbound SMB traffic**This and other vulnerabilities may be mitigated by blocking outbound SMB traffic from your network to the internet. |
