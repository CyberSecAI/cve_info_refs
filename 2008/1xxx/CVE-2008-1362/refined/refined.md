Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1362:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure creation of named pipe objects within the VMware authd process on Windows systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Named Pipes:** The authd process creates named pipes in a way that allows a malicious local user to control and connect to them.
*   **Impersonation:** A malicious user can successfully impersonate the authd process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By impersonating authd, a malicious user can gain the privileges under which authd is executing, typically LocalSystem privileges.
*   **Denial of Service:** The insecure named pipe object could also be exploited to create a denial of service attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires a malicious user to have local access to the Windows system where the vulnerable VMware product is installed.
*   **Named Pipe Manipulation:** The attacker needs to create and control a named pipe, and then force the authd process to connect to it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create and manipulate named pipes.
*   The attacker needs to be able to execute code that can interact with the vulnerable VMware software.

**Summary of Findings**

CVE-2008-1362 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability on Windows due to insecure named pipe creation in the VMware authd process.  A malicious local user can exploit this to gain LocalSystem privileges or cause a denial of service.
