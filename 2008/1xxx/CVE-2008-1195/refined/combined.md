## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) -

## Details

Alexey Proskuryakov, Yosuke Hasegawa and Simon Montagu discovered flaws

in Firefox's character encoding handling. If a user were tricked into

opening a malicious web page, an attacker could perform cross-site

scripting attacks. ([CVE-2008-0416](/security/CVE-2008-0416))

Various flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine. By tricking

a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could escalate

privileges within the browser, perform cross-site scripting attacks

and/or execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.

([CVE-2008-1233](/security/CVE-2008-1233), [CVE-2008-1234](/security/CVE-2008-1234), [CVE-2008-1235](/security/CVE-2008-1235))

Several problems were discovered in Firefox which could lead to crashes

and memory corruption. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious

web page, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the

user's privileges. ([CVE-2008-1236](/security/CVE-2008-1236), [CVE-2008-1237](/security/CVE-2008-1237))

Gregory Fleischer discovered Firefox did not properly process HTTP

Referrer headers when they were sent with with requests to URLs

containing Basic Authentication credentials with empty usernames. An

attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform cross-site request

forgery attacks. ([CVE-2008-1238](/security/CVE-2008-1238))

Peter Brodersen and Alexander Klink reported that default the setting in

Firefox for SSL Client Authentication allowed for users to be tracked

via their client certificate. The default has been changed to prompt

the user each time a website requests a client certificate.

([CVE-2007-4879](/security/CVE-2007-4879))

Gregory Fleischer discovered that web content fetched via the jar

protocol could use Java LiveConnect to connect to arbitrary ports on

the user's machine due to improper parsing in the Java plugin. If a

user were tricked into opening malicious web content, an attacker may be

able to access services running on the user's machine. ([CVE-2008-1195](/security/CVE-2008-1195),

[CVE-2008-1240](/security/CVE-2008-1240))

Chris Thomas discovered that Firefox would allow an XUL popup from an

unselected tab to display in front of the selected tab. An attacker

could exploit this behavior to spoof a login prompt and steal the user's

credentials. ([CVE-2008-1241](/security/CVE-2008-1241))

# JRockit: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200804-28**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in BEA JRockit.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.14** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.4.2.16**>= **1.5.0.14** |

### Background

JRockit is BEA WebLogic's J2SE Development Kit.

### Description

Because of sharing the same codebase, JRockit is affected by the
vulnerabilities mentioned in GLSA 200804-20.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet
on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute
arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security
restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker
could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and
read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in
the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of
Service via multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2008-18

## Java socket connection to any local port via LiveConnect

Announced
March 25, 2008
Reporter
Gregory Fleischer
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.13
* SeaMonkey 1.1.9

### Description

Security researcher **Gregory Fleischer** demonstrated that
web content fetched via the `jar:` protocol can use Java via
LiveConnect to open socket connections to arbitrary ports on the user's machine
("localhost"). The issue is caused by improper parsing of the content origin
passed from the browser to the Java plugin. Such content was incorrectly
evaluated to have a null host, assumed to be a local file, and was
subsequently allowed permission to connect to the localhost. Sun has updated
the Java Runtime Environment with a fix for this problem. Mozilla has also
added a fix to LiveConnect to protect users who don't have the latest version
of Java.

### Workaround

Disable Java until a version containing fixes can be installed or upgrade
your system's JRE to one of the fixed versions listed in Sun's advisory:
1.6.0\_05, 1.5.0\_15, and 1.4.2\_17.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Sun JDK/JRE: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200705-23**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in Sun Java Development Kit
(JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/sun-jdk** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.11**revision >= **1.4.2.14**revision >= **1.4.2.15**revision >= **1.4.2.19** |

| Package | **dev-java/sun-jre-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.0.01** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.0.01**revision >= **1.5.0.16**revision >= **1.5.0.15**revision >= **1.5.0.12**revision >= **1.5.0.11**revision >= **1.4.2.18**revision >= **1.4.2.17**revision >= **1.4.2.15**revision >= **1.4.2.14**revision >= **1.4.2.19**revision >= **1.5.0.17**revision >= **1.5.0.18** |

### Background

The Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Sun Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the Sun Java platform.

### Description

An unspecified vulnerability involving an "incorrect use of system
classes" was reported by the Fujitsu security team. Additionally, Chris
Evans from the Google Security Team reported an integer overflow
resulting in a buffer overflow in the ICC parser used with JPG or BMP
files, and an incorrect open() call to /dev/tty when processing certain
BMP files.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted Java
class or applet that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities. This
could lead to the execution of arbitrary code outside of the Java
sandbox and of the Java security restrictions, or crash the Java
application or the browser.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Sun Java Development Kit users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-java/sun-jdk"
```

All Sun Java Runtime Environment users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-java/sun-jre-bin"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Content that is retrieved using the 'jar:' protocol can use LiveConnect to connect to arbitrary ports on the localhost. There is some miscalculation as to the origin of the content, and LiveConnect/Java plugin appear to believe it originated from the localhost. Consequently, arbitrary socket connections are allowed to the localhost.
This vulnerability could place services that are normally only available from the localhost at increased risk of exploitation.

No, this has not been reported to Sun. I'm not convinced that this a problem in the Java plugin. If the problem was reproducible in the latest Minefield, the issue would most likely be originating in the JRE. But, there is differing behavior between 2.0.0.9 and Minefield with the same exact JRE plugin.
I've retested with the latest nightly builds and Java plugin versions.

The same is true on branch. The question of what GetHost should be on jar: URIs has come up before; I wonder whether this code should dig into the URI manually... probably worth filing a bug on this, at least.

[Bug 336303](/show_bug.cgi?id=336303 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]nsPrincipal::GetOrigin should dig into nested URIs") is in that range -- you sure it isn't that? Alternately, this looks like it was right after the thread manager landing, so maybe a nightly got skipped or something and the range should actually encompass that landing.

So it is. I suppose that's possible... Before that change, the origin was that jar: URI. After it, it's the URI nested inside the jar: URI. I do see OJI code getting the origin, but it just passes it off to the Java plugin, as far as I can tell.
And given that I'm not seeing the problem on branch with the plugin version here, and that there is no issue on Mac, I would agree that this is a plugin bug, I think...
We could change GetOrigin on branch, perhaps, but if the plugin is just buggy with URI stuff like that, there are plenty of other ways it could be exploited by using non-HTTP URIs....

That is most likely where the issue is. If the origin is being reported as the jar: URI, then that is the reason connections can be established. Since a jar: URI has no host component and an empty host is equated with localhost, the JVM believes the content is coming from the localhost and can connect back to it. This is similar to how a URI of "file:///foo/bar.html" has an empty host component so connections are allowed to the localhost.

I tested on a fresh Ubuntu 7.10 (x86\_64) install, latest BonEcho/2.0.0.10pre and the JRE versions 1.6.0\_01, 1.6.0\_02, and 1.6.0\_03. The problem was reproducible in all cases.
Apple ships its own version of Java (<http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/javaformacosx104release5.html>). This was last updated in February and supposedly contains multiple severe vulnerabilities.
Firefox for the Mac uses the MRJ plugin and is not vulnerable because it is correctly calculating the origin. On my Mac, this is contents of the Java console from the jar: URI test page:

I believe GetOrigin needs to correctly report where the content is derived from.
I tested both gopher: and ftp: protocol handling. When wrapped with a jar: URI, the vulnerability is present. When accessed normally, it is not.

That's a serious security bug in the JVM, if that's what it does. The two are NOT the same. There are lots of URIs that have no host component anywhere in sight. data: comes to mind.
> The problem was reproducible in all cases.
Odd. I'm definitely getting that security exception I cited above with the JRE version I have on FC3...

It does that, in general. That would be the URI. We happen to have some special knowledge of jar: URIs that allows us to report the site the jar: is loaded from instead, but we're possibly considering changing that in any case. At which point as far as the entire security system in Gecko is concerned the origin will simply be the jar: URI.
More importantly, there are plenty of other URI types out there that could be loading Java. data:, as I said. Heck, any extension can implement a protocol handler for any scheme it wants. URIs need not have hosts. Treating any URI without a host as coming from localhost, even if the URI scheme in general can't have a host, is a security bug, pure and simple.
So the key is that we could change the behavior of jar: and the vulnerability would remain: you'd just need to load your stuff via any of a number of methods that don't involve hosts and aren't jar:. The only place that can be fixed is by fixing the silly localhost assumption in the plug-in.

I performed a default install of Fedora Core 3 under VMware and added the httpd package. I did a "yum update" to the latest versions. I installed the most recent BonEcho/2.0.0.10pre and Java Plug-in 1.6.0\_01. The issue was present.
I will continue investigating.

In OJI we could whitelist schemes--http(s), file, maybe ftp and gopher if we feel generous--and return an error for anything else. Or ensure the URI has a host or schemeIs file.

We probably want a fix on the trunk, too. These JAR testcases might be fixed but as bz points out in [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=402995#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol content can use LiveConnect to connect to arbitrary ports on localhost") a similar attack could probably be constructed using other hostless schemes.Assignee: nobody → dveditzProduct: Firefox → CoreQA Contact: firefox → toolkit

The Java Embedding Plugin does (of course) use a forked descendant of
the MRJCarbon plugin (the JEP is bundled with Mozilla.org OS X distros
that can use Java <http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/>).

This problem is still present in the JEP's forked descendant of the
MRJCarbon plugin (what I call the "MRJ Plugin JEP"). But I've never
had any problems with it.
I \_did\_ (long ago) fix a much more serious bug in this code, which
caused frequent crashes:
"codebase" is uninitialized, and GetOrigin() can return NS\_OK without
doing anything to "codebase" (thereby leaving it unitialized). This
caused crashes at NewStringUTF.

I just looked at nsPrincipal.cpp and found that this is no longer true

Do you know why I haven't had trouble using delete[] on something
allocated using nsMemory::Alloc()? I haven't yet managed to figure
out nsMemory::Alloc() (or the underlying NS\_Alloc()). But I suspect
it's probably alright (though not quite kosher) to use delete[] on a
simple object (like a char\*) that's been malloced.

It is not acceptable to free[] a buffer that has been NS\_Alloc'ed. Use NS\_Free instead. It might work if you were linking the same CRT and it was never hooked, but that's not always a safe assumption.

I'll do this in my next release of the JEP.
But, given that the "bad" code is exercised very often, and that (as
far as I know) nobody has ever had any trouble with it, I don't think
this is urgent.

I raised it mainly because of the recent noises about hooking in different allocators in attempts measure and deal with memory fragmentation; it might well \_become\_ an issue even if we've gotten away with it so far.

OK, thanks.
If possible, please give me a warning when this seems about to happen.
Or point me to bug(s) where this possibility is being tracked.
I don't currently plan to release a new JEP for several months
... mainly because I'd be hard-pressed to find the time to deal with
the various issues (so far all of minor importance) that have come up
since the last JEP release.

This bug is currently classified as moderate, but I think the severity is higher. This allows an attacker to connect to any open port on the loopback device. Lots of applications, like google desktop, use this without any authentication. With google desktop (for example) an attacker can now steal any indexed file (which is usually every file that matters to the user.)
The loopback interface is only available locally. The services listening are only available to the local machine as a mechanism for interprocess communication. They are not protected by the host firewall since the interface is only accessible locally. Most of them don't even use authentication. It looks like this issue opens a vector that exposes services that listen on the loopback address to content from the web.

It's a JRE bug (e.g. the JRE also allows file:// pages to connect to localhost, and we can't really fix that without also blocking access to other file:// URIs, which might in fact break things).
But we should do what dveditz suggests in [comment 14](/show_bug.cgi?id=402995#c14 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol content can use LiveConnect to connect to arbitrary ports on localhost"). I'd offer to, but I can't really test very well: about 70% of the time I load an applet, the browser completely hangs. Might be better if someone who can actually test the patch writes it...

Confirming that we are looking into this issue from our side.
It appears that applets, even unsigned applets, are uniformly granted permission to connect back to the localhost, and have been for many releases of Java. Personally I don't understand the reasons for granting this particular permission, but I imagine there would be compatibility problems with simply removing this permission as a fix for this issue. I'm not sure what other options are available on the JRE side for closing this hole. The appropriate people from Sun have been engaged, in particular those who were involved in the previous issue with the verbatim: protocol handler.

re: [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=402995#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol content can use LiveConnect to connect to arbitrary ports on localhost") -- data: URIs are OK because they do get an origin from the principal. At least data: URIs created by web content, ones that get a nsNullPrincipal would have this same problem.
Bailing out of GetOrigin() with an error on hostless schemes won't help -- if the JRE gets an error from here it apparently goes ahead and uses a null principal. That means another avenue for attack would be to try to launch from an origin longer than the buffer. Easy to do for schemes without a host, but pointless because you've already won. Schemes with a host have an origin of just the scheme+host+port which shouldn't exceed the 512-byte buffer--at least not according to the spec and not supported by us in FF2.0 and trunk as far as some quick testing shows (I got up to 263 counting the https scheme, plus I guess a few more for the port), but I'm not 100% confident without digging into necko code.
On the branch for jar: we could manually de-nest the URI, or even back-port nested-URI support and make GetOrigin() do the right thing. That still leaves other hostless schemes. Do we even want file: uris to be able to hit the loopback? Blocking that might break legit apps, but not blocking it means any saved web-page can poke at your machine and exfiltrate data. (see also [bug 402998](/show_bug.cgi?id=402998 "RESOLVED FIXED - java in local file can read any files"))
We could also make up a fake host for hostless schemes and return that: <http://nohost.invalid> -- of course maybe the JRE knows about rfc2606 and will map that back to localhostKeywords: [qawanted](/buglist.cgi?keywords=qawanted&resolution=---)

The root cause is a bug in the Java Plug-In and not in the web browser. The Java Plug-In models LiveConnect calls from untrusted JavaScript code as coming from untrusted Java code whose origin is the same as that of the document. Specifically, if the JavaScript code was downloaded over the network rather than fetched from a local file, then it is granted a SocketPermission to connect back to the originating host. ([Comment 27](/show_bug.cgi?id=402995#c27 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol content can use LiveConnect to connect to arbitrary ports on localhost"), which I made above, is only correct in the case of applets fetched from files.)
The bug is an error in the Java Plug-In's code which parses the origin, which is passed in from the browser-side LiveConnect code. On Firefox 2, the origin passed in is the entire jar: URL. The Java Plug-In incorrectly determines that this URL has a null host and grants a SocketPermission to connect to a null host, which has the unexpected result that the LiveConnect calls from this web page may connect to localhost.
The fix, determined by Christopher.Hegarty@sun.com and the rest of the security and networking teams, is to detect the situation where the host is null and make a best-effort attempt to handle the nested URL. In the case of failure, no SocketPermission is granted at all.
This fix will become available in a forthcoming release of the Java Plug-In. Thanks for the test case.
The reason the Firefox 2 browser is vulnerable and the Firefox 3 browser is not is that in Firefox 3 the origin passed in from the browser to LiveConnect calls is different and arguably more correct. In Firefox 2 it is the entire document base (e.g. jar:[http://host.com/foo.zip!/bar.html](http://host.com/foo.zip%21/bar.html)) but in Firefox 3 it is <http://host.com/> , so in Firefox 3 the bug in the Java Plug-In is not triggered.

Kenneth, I assume that means that for jar: the Java Plug-In will try to extract the nested URI (which might be multiply-nested if there are multiple jar: prefixes) and for other host-less schemes the SocketPermission won't be granted?
If so, that sounds fabulous. Thanks for the quick response!
We should still do [comment 14](/show_bug.cgi?id=402995#c14 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol content can use LiveConnect to connect to arbitrary ports on localhost") for users who don't upgrade their Java install, I think.

Boris: yes. Actually in our current fix we only attempt to dive one level into the nested URI (to stave off potential denial of service or other problems with pathological URIs), but otherwise what you've described is correct.
FYI, if it's straightforward to modify FF 2's OJI implementation to mimic FF 3's behavior regarding the origin of the LiveConnect call, that would be another possible workaround rather than simply blocking LiveConnect calls from all but a certain set of URL schemes.

It's reasonably straightforward, but would only help with jar:. Other schemes would still have issues...
What we should probably do is block all schemes for which GetHost() on the URI actually fails.

Yes, the changes in JRE 1.6\_05 appear to resolve the issue.
Currently, the Sun Alert for this issue <http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-66-233326-1> is reporting:
"""
This issue can occur in the following releases running Firefox 2.0.0.9 and earlier:
\* JDK and JRE 6 Update 4 and earlier
\* JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 14 and earlier
\* SDK and JRE 1.4.2\_16 and earlier
Note: This issue does not occur on Firefox 2.0.0.10 or later and does not occur on all versions of Internet Explorer.
"""
This is clearly incorrect as the issue is still reproducible in Firefox 2.0.0.12 with JRE 1.6\_04.
I sent an email to security-alert@sun.com about this discrepancy after it was first posted, but haven't heard anything back.

I am the engineer who was asked to confirm and reply to your email to security-alert@sun.com. I apologize, but I do not have the time to re-verify this issue at this point. When I tested the original fix, the bug occurred with Firefox 2.0.0.9 but not with 2.0.0.10 due to an apparent tightening of security on the browser side. I don't know whether this was relaxed in a later Firefox build but the Sun security alert was correct as of the release of 2.0.0.10.

That's odd. The change between 2.0.0.9 and 2.0.0.10 involved restricting jar: content to a files with a Content-Type header of "application/java-archive" or "application/x-jar" (<http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2007/mfsa2007-37.html>). Possibly your tests didn't account for this and the content was being blocked because it didn't have the correct MIME type.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
IBM Java 1.4.2 was updated to SR10 and IBM Java 1.5.0 was updated to
SR7 to fix various security issues:
- CVE-2008-1196: A buffer overflow vulnerability in Java Web Start
may allow an untrusted Java Web Start application that is downloaded
from a website to elevate its privileges. For example, an untrusted
Java Web Start application may grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or execute local applications that are accessible
to the user running the untrusted application.
- CVE-2008-1195: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment may
allow JavaScript(TM) code that is downloaded by a browser to make
connections to network services on the system that the browser runs
on, through Java APIs, This may allow files (that are accessible
through these network services) or vulnerabilities (that exist on
these network services) which are not otherwise normally accessible
to be accessed or exploited.
- CVE-2008-1192: A vulnerability in the Java Plug-in may an untrusted
applet to bypass same origin policy and leverage this flaw to
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
- CVE-2008-1190: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow an
untrusted Java Web Start application to elevate its privileges. For
example, an application may grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or execute local applications that are accessible
to the user running the untrusted application.
- CVE-2008-1189: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment may allow an untrusted applet or application to elevate
its privileges. For example, an applet may grant itself permissions
to read and write local files or execute local applications that
are accessible to the user running the untrusted applet.
- CVE-2008-1187: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
with parsing XML data may allow an untrusted applet or application
to elevate its privileges. For example, an applet may read certain
URL resources (such as some files and web pages).
- CVE-2007-5232: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with applet caching may allow an untrusted applet that is
downloaded from a malicious website to make network connections to
network services on machines other than the one that the applet was
downloaded from. This may allow network resources (such as web pages)
and vulnerabilities (that exist on these network services) which
are not otherwise normally accessible to be accessed or exploited.
- CVE-2007-5274: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
may allow malicious Javascript code that is downloaded by a browser
from a malicious website to make network connections, through Java
APIs, to network services on machines other than the one that the
Javascript code was downloaded from. This may allow network resources
(such as web pages) and vulnerabilities (that exist on these network
services) which are not otherwise normally accessible to be accessed
or exploited.
- CVE-2007-5273: A second vulnerability in the JRE may allow an
untrusted applet that is downloaded from a malicious website through
a web proxy to make network connections to network services on
machines other than the one that the applet was downloaded from. This
may allow network resources (such as web pages) and vulnerabilities
(that exist on these network services) which are not otherwise
normally accessible to be accessed or exploited.
- CVE-2007-5236: An untrusted Java Web Start application may
write arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running
the application.
- CVE-2007-5238: Three separate vulnerabilities may allow an untrusted
Java Web Start application to determine the location of the Java
Web Start cache.
- CVE-2007-5239: An untrusted Java Web Start application or Java
applet may move or copy arbitrary files by requesting the user of
the application or applet to drag and drop a file from the Java
Web Start application or Java applet window.
- CVE-2007-5240: An untrusted applet may display an over-sized window
so that the applet warning banner is not visible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
- CVE-2007-4381: A vulnerability in the font parsing code in the
Java Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet to elevate
its privileges. For example, an applet may grant itself permissions
to read and write local files or execute local applications that
are accessible to the user running the untrusted applet.
- CVE-2007-3698: The Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) that is
included in various releases of the Java Runtime Environment does not
correctly process SSL/TLS handshake requests. This vulnerability may
be exploited to create a Denial of Service (DoS) condition to the
system as a whole on a server that listens for SSL/TLS connections
using JSSE for SSL/TLS support.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart running instances of IBM Java.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Notes: These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely only if the
attacker has access to the service console network.
Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the
service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see
[http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](/resources/techresources/726) for more
information on VMware security best practices.

The currently installed versions of Tomcat and JRE depend
on your patch deployment history.

### Background

The Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Sun Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the Sun Java platform.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Sun Java:

* Daniel Soeder discovered that a long codebase attribute string in a
  JNLP file will overflow a stack variable when launched by Java WebStart
  (CVE-2007-3655).
* Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2007-2435, CVE-2007-2788,
  CVE-2007-2789) that were previously reported as GLSA 200705-23 and GLSA
  200706-08 also affect 1.4 and 1.6 SLOTs, which was not mentioned in the
  initial revision of said GLSAs.
* The Zero Day Initiative, TippingPoint and John Heasman reported
  multiple buffer overflows and unspecified vulnerabilities in Java Web
  Start (CVE-2008-1188, CVE-2008-1189, CVE-2008-1190,
  CVE-2008-1191).
* Hisashi Kojima of Fujitsu and JPCERT/CC reported a security issue
  when performing XSLT transformations (CVE-2008-1187).
* CERT/CC reported a Stack-based buffer overflow in Java Web Start
  when using JNLP files (CVE-2008-1196).
* Azul Systems reported an unspecified vulnerability that allows
  applets to escalate their privileges (CVE-2007-5689).
* Billy Rios, Dan Boneh, Collin Jackson, Adam Barth, Andrew Bortz,
  Weidong Shao, and David Byrne discovered multiple instances where Java
  applets or JavaScript programs run within browsers do not pin DNS
  hostnames to a single IP address, allowing for DNS rebinding attacks
  (CVE-2007-5232, CVE-2007-5273, CVE-2007-5274).
* Peter Csepely reported that Java Web Start does not properly
  enforce access restrictions for untrusted applications (CVE-2007-5237,
  CVE-2007-5238).
* Java Web Start does not properly enforce access restrictions for
  untrusted Java applications and applets, when handling drag-and-drop
  operations (CVE-2007-5239).
* Giorgio Maone discovered that warnings for untrusted code can be
  hidden under applications' windows (CVE-2007-5240).
* Fujitsu reported two security issues where security restrictions of
  web applets and applications were not properly enforced (CVE-2008-1185,
  CVE-2008-1186).
* John Heasman of NGSSoftware discovered that the Java Plug-in does
  not properly enforce the same origin policy (CVE-2008-1192).
* Chris Evans of the Google Security Team discovered multiple
  unspecified vulnerabilities within the Java Runtime Environment Image
  Parsing Library (CVE-2008-1193, CVE-2008-1194).
* Gregory Fleischer reported that web content fetched via the "jar:"
  protocol was not subject to network access restrictions
  (CVE-2008-1195).
* Chris Evans and Johannes Henkel of the Google Security Team
  reported that the XML parsing code retrieves external entities even
  when that feature is disabled (CVE-2008-0628).
* Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities might allow for escalation of
  privileges (CVE-2008-0657).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet
on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute
arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security
restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker
could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and
read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in
the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of
Service via multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

- MFSA 2008-14/CVE-2008-1233, CVE-2008-1234, and CVE-2008-1235:
JavaScript privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution.
On Novell Linux Desktop 9 the fixes were back ported to the Firefox 1.5.0.14
version.
seamonkey, mozilla-xulrunner and likely Thunderbird updates will
follow in the next days.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Mozilla Firefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

allows remote attackers to bypass the same origin policy and
"execute local applications" via unknown vectors.
- CVE-2008-1192: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Plug-in for
Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 4 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 14 and
earlier; and SDK and JRE 1.4.2\_16 and earlier, and 1.3.1\_21 and
earlier; allows remote attackers to bypass the same origin policy
and "execute local applications" via unknown vectors.
- CVE-2008-1193: Unspecified vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment

(javaws.exe) in Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 4 and earlier and 5.0 Update
14 and earlier; and SDK and JRE 1.4.2\_16 and earlier; allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted JNLP file.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Sun Java after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

# IBM JDK/JRE: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200806-11**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in IBM Java Development Kit (JDK)
and Java Runtime Environment (JRE), resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.7**revision >= **1.4.2.11** |

| Package | **dev-java/ibm-jre-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.7**revision >= **1.4.2.11** |

### Background

The IBM Java Development Kit (JDK) and the IBM Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the IBM Java platform.

### Description

Because of sharing the same codebase, IBM JDK and JRE are affected by
the vulnerabilities mentioned in GLSA 200804-20.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet
on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute
arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security
restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker
could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and
read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in
the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of
Service via multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All IBM JDK 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin-1.5.0.7"
```

All IBM JDK 1.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin-1.4.2.11"
```

All IBM JRE 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jre-bin-1.5.0.7"
```

All IBM JRE 1.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jre-bin-1.4.2.11"
```
