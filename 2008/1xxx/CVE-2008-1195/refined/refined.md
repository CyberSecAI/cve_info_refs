{
  "CVE-2008-1195": {
    "Root cause": "Improper parsing of content origin in the Java plugin when fetching content via the 'jar:' protocol using Java LiveConnect.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The Java plugin incorrectly evaluated content fetched via the 'jar:' protocol as having a null host, which was then interpreted as local content, allowing socket connections to arbitrary ports on the user's machine (localhost)."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could trick a user into opening a malicious webpage or web content fetched via the jar protocol, gaining the ability to connect to arbitrary ports on the user's machine (localhost), potentially accessing local services.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious webpage utilizing the 'jar:' protocol and Java LiveConnect to exploit the improper origin parsing."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to create and host malicious web pages or content that utilizes the jar protocol and Java LiveConnect.",
      "Ability to trick the user into visiting the malicious page."
    ]
  }
