# FreeType: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200806-10**

Font parsing vulnerabilities in FreeType might lead to user-assisted
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/freetype** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.3.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.3.6**revision >= **1.4\_pre20080316-r1** |

### Background

FreeType is a font rendering library for TrueType Font (TTF) and
Printer Font Binary (PFB).

### Description

Regenrecht reported multiple vulnerabilities in FreeType via iDefense:

* An integer overflow when parsing values in the Private dictionary table
  in a PFB file, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2008-1806).
* An invalid free() call related to parsing an invalid "number of axes"
  field in a PFB file (CVE-2008-1807).
* Multiple off-by-one errors when parsing PBF and TTF files, leading to
  heap-based buffer overflows (CVE-2008-1808).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TTF
or PBF file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running an application linked against
FreeType (such as the X.org X server, running as root).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All FreeType users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/freetype-2.3.6"
```

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0556)

## Topic

Updated freetype packages that fix various security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

[Updated 25th June 2008]
The original packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 distributed with
this errata had a bug which prevented freetype library from loading certain
font files correctly. We have updated the packages to correct this bug.

## Description

FreeType is a free, high-quality, portable font engine that can open and
manage font files, as well as efficiently load, hint and render individual
glyphs.

Multiple flaws were discovered in FreeType's Printer Font Binary (PFB)
font-file format parser. If a user loaded a carefully crafted font-file
with a program linked against FreeType, it could cause the application to
crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-1806, CVE-2008-1807,
CVE-2008-1808)

Note: the flaw in FreeType's TrueType Font (TTF) font-file format parser,
covered by CVE-2008-1808, did not affect the freetype packages as shipped
in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5, as they are not compiled with TTF
Byte Code Interpreter (BCI) support.

Users of freetype should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# About the security content of iPhone v2.1

This document describes the security content of iPhone v2.1.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see "[How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25314)."

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see "[Apple Security Updates](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61798)."

#### iPhone v2.1

* **Application Sandbox**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3631

  Available for: iPhone v2.0 through v2.0.2

  Impact: An application may be able to read another application's files

  Description: The Application Sandbox does not properly enforce access restrictions between third-party applications. This may allow a third-party application to read files in another third-party application's sandbox, and lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by enforcing the proper access restrictions between application sandboxes. Credit to Nicolas Seriot of Sen:te and Bryce Cogswell for reporting this issue. This issue does not affect iPhone versions prior to v2.0.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-1806, CVE-2008-1807, CVE-2008-1808

  Available for: iPhone v1.0 through v2.0.2

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in FreeType v2.3.5

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in FreeType v2.3.5, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution when accessing maliciously crafted font data. This update addresses the issue by incorporating the security fixes from version 2.3.6 of FreeType. Further information is available via the FreeType site at <http://www.freetype.org/>

* **mDNSResponder**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-1447

  Available for: iPhone v1.0 through v2.0.2

  Impact: mDNSResponder is susceptible to DNS cache poisoning and may return forged information

  Description: mDNSResponder provides translation between host names and IP addresses for applications that use its unicast DNS resolution API. A weakness in the DNS protocol may allow a remote attacker to perform DNS cache poisoning attacks. As a result, applications that rely on mDNSResponder for DNS may receive forged information. This update addresses the issue by implementing source port and transaction ID randomization to improve resilience against cache poisoning attacks. Credit to Dan Kaminsky of IOActive for reporting this issue.

* **Networking**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3612

  Available for: iPhone v1.0 through v2.0.2

  Impact: Predictable TCP initial sequence numbers generation may lead to TCP spoofing or session hijacking

  Description: TCP initial sequence numbers are sequentially generated. Predictable initial sequence numbers may allow a remote attacker to create a spoofed TCP connection or insert data into an existing TCP connection. This update addresses the issue by generating random TCP initial sequence numbers.

* **Passcode Lock**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3633

  Available for: iPhone v2.0 through v2.0.2

  Impact: An unauthorized user may bypass the Passcode Lock and launch iPhone applications

  Description: The Passcode Lock feature is designed to prevent applications from being launched unless the correct passcode is entered. An implementation issue in the handling of emergency calls allows users with physical access to an iPhone to launch an application without the passcode by double clicking the home button in emergency call. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of emergency calls. Credit to Matthew Yohe of The University of Iowa's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering for reporting this issue. This issue does not affect iPhone versions prior to v2.0.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3632

  Available for: iPhone v1.0 through v2.0.2

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A use-after-free issue exists in WebKit's handling of CSS import statements. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of document references.

## Details

Multiple flaws were discovered in the PFB and TTF font handling code

in freetype. If a user were tricked into using a specially crafted

font file, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user

privileges or cause the application linked against freetype to crash,

leading to a denial of service.

##### 3. Problem Description

I Security Issues

a. Setting ActiveX killbit
Starting from this release, VMware has set the killbit on its
ActiveX controls. Setting the killbit ensures that ActiveX
controls cannot run in Internet Explorer (IE), and avoids
Microsoft KB article 240797 and the related references on this
topic.
Security vulnerabilities have been reported for ActiveX controls
provided by VMware when run in IE. Under specific circumstances,
exploitation of these ActiveX controls might result in denial-of-
service or can allow running of arbitrary code when the user
browses a malicious Web site or opens a malicious file in IE
browser. An attempt to run unsafe ActiveX controls in IE might
result in pop-up windows warning the user.
Note: IE can be configured to run unsafe ActiveX controls without
prompting. VMware recommends that you retain the default
settings in IE, which prompts when unsafe actions are
requested.
Earlier, VMware had issued knowledge base articles, KB 5965318 and
KB 9078920 on security issues with ActiveX controls. To avoid
malicious scripts that exploit ActiveX controls, do not enable
unsafe ActiveX objects in your browser settings. As a best
practice, do not browse untrusted Web sites as an administrator
and do not click OK or Yes if prompted by IE to allow certain
actions.
VMware would like to thank Julien Bachmann, Shennan Wang, Shinnai,
and Michal Bucko for reporting these issues to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2008-3691, CVE-2008-3692,
CVE-2008-3693, CVE-2008-3694, CVE-2008-3695, CVE-2007-5438, and
CVE-2008-3696 to the security issues with VMware ActiveX controls.

b. VMware ISAPI Extension Denial of Service

The Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) is
an API that extends the functionality of Internet Information
Server (IIS). VMware uses ISAPI extensions in its Server product.
One of the ISAPI extensions provided by VMware is vulnerable to a
remote denial of service. By sending a malformed request, IIS
might shut down. IIS 6.0 restarts automatically. However, IIS 5.0
does not restart automatically when its Startup Type is set to Manual.
VMware would like to thank the Juniper Networks J-Security
Security Research Team for reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-3697 to this issue.

c. OpenProcess Local Privilege Escalation on Host System

This release fixes a privilege escalation vulnerability in host
systems. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows users to run
arbitrary code on the host system with elevated privileges.
VMware would like to thank Sun Bing from McAfee, Inc. for
reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-3698 to this issue.

f. VMware Consolidated Backup (VCB) command-line utilities may expose sensitive information

VMware Consolidated Backup command-line utilities accept the user
password through the -p command-line option. Users logged into the
ESX service console or into the system that runs VCB could gain
access to the username and password used by VCB command-line
utilities
when such commands are running.
The ESX patch and the new version of VCB resolve this issue by
providing an alternative way of passing the password used by VCB
command-line utilities.
VCB in ESX
----------
The following options are recommended for passing the password:
1. The password is specified in /etc/backuptools.conf
(PASSWORD=xxxxx), and -p is not used in the command line.
/etc/backuptools.conf file permissions are read/write only
for root.
2. No password is specified in /etc/backuptools.conf and the
-p option is not used in the command line. The user will be
prompted to enter a password.
ESX is not affected unless you use VCB.
Stand-alone VCB
---------------
The following options are recommended for passing the password:
1. The password is specified in config.js (PASSWORD=xxxxx), and -p
is not used in the command line. The file permissions on config.js
are read/write only for the administrator. The config.js file is
located in folder "config" of the VCB installation folder. For
example,
C:\Program Files\Vmware\Vmware Consolidated Backup Framework\config.
2. The password is specified in the registry, and is not specified in
config.js, and -p is not used in the command line. Access to the
registry key holding the password is allowed only to the
administrator.
The location of the registry key is:
On Windows x86: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\VMware, Inc.\
VMware Consolidated Backup\Password
On Windows x64: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\
VMware, Inc.\VMware Consolidated Backup\Password
3. The password is not specified in the registry, and is not
specified in
config.js, and -p is not used in the command line. The user will be
prompted to enter a password.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-2101 to this issue.

g. Third Party Library libpng Updated to 1.2.29

Several flaws were discovered in the way third party library
libpng handled various PNG image chunks. An attacker could
create a carefully crafted PNG image file in such a way that
it causes an application linked with libpng to crash when the
file is manipulated.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2007-5269 to this issue.
NOTE: There are multiple patches required to remediate the issue.

##### II ESX Service Console rpm updates

a. update to bind

This update upgrades the service console rpms for bind-utils and
bind-lib to version 9.2.4-22.el3.
Version 9.2.4.-22.el3 addresses the recently discovered
vulnerability in the BIND software used for Domain Name
resolution (DNS). VMware doesn't install all the BIND packages
on ESX Server and is not vulnerable by default to the reported
vulnerability. Of the BIND packages, VMware only ships bind-util
and bind-lib in the service console and these components by
themselves cannot be used to setup a DNS server. Bind-lib and
bind-util are used in client DNS applications like nsupdate,
nslookup, etc.
VMware explicitly discourages installing applications like BIND
on the service console. In case the customer has installed BIND,
and the DNS server is configured to support recursive queries,
their ESX Server system is affected and they should replace BIND
with a patched version.
Note: ESX Server will use the DNS server on the network it is
on, so it is important to patch that DNS server.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-1447 to this issue.

# VMware Player, Server, Workstation: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation, allowing remote and local attackers to conduct several
attacks, including privilege escalation, remote execution of arbitrary
code, and a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-player** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-workstation** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **6.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-server** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0.9.156507** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

VMware Player, Server, and Workstation allow emulation of a complete PC
on a PC without the usual performance overhead of most emulators.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

Local users may be able to gain escalated privileges, cause a Denial of
Service, or gain sensitive information.

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code, or a Denial
of Service. Remote attackers also may be able to spoof DNS traffic, read
arbitrary files, or inject arbitrary web script to the VMware Server
Console.

Furthermore, guest OS users may be able to execute arbitrary code on the
host OS, gain escalated privileges on the guest OS, or cause a Denial of
Service (crash the host OS).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Player. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Player:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-player"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
“>=app-emulation/vmware-player-3.1.5”, however these packages are
not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Workstation. We recommend that
users unmerge VMware Workstation:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-workstation"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
“>=app-emulation/vmware-workstation-7.1.5”, however these packages
are not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Server. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Server:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-server"

```

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- sudo not flushing stdin
This update of sudo flushes the stdin buffer on password
timeout. Unflushed buffers can lead to leaking the password via a
parent process reading stdin after sudo exits.
This issue only affects openSUSE 10.3 and was fixed there.
- courier-authlib SQL injection possibility
courier-authlib was updated to fix a bug that allowed SQL
injections. (CVE-2008-2667)
Only openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0 were affected.
- gnome-screensaver
Using gnome-screensaver an attacker could log in without a valid
password if the NIS server is down. (CVE-2008-0887)
gnome-screensaver was affected on SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE
Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and was fixed there.
- clamav 0.93.1
Clamav was updated to version 0.93.1. It fixes various bugs and
one minor security issue:
CVE-2008-2713: libclamav/petite.c in ClamAV before 0.93.1 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted Petite
file that triggers an out-of-bounds read.
clamav was updated on all products containing clamav.
- PHP 5 security update
php5 was updated to fix various bugs and security problems:
- possible stack-based buffer overflow CVE-2008-2050
- incomplete escapeshellcmd() CVE-2008-2051
- printf() integer overflow CVE-2008-1384
- insecure GENERATE\_SEED macro CVE-2008-2107
- timezone update for DST in Pakistan
On openSUSE 10.2 up to 11.0 php5 was updated to 5.2.6. For SUSE
Linux Enterprise 10 SP1 and SP2 the fixes were backported.
- ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick security problems
ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick were affected by two security problems:
CVE-2008-1096: Buffer overflow in the handling of XCF files
CVE-2008-1097: Heap buffer overflow in the handling of PCX files
ImageMagick was updated on all products. GraphicsMagick is only
found on openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0 and was updated there.
- mtr potential remote overflow
MTR was updated to fix a stack based buffer overflow which could
potentially be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2008-2357).
mtr was updated on all SUSE Linux based products.
- bind root zone update
The IP number for the "L" root DNS server changed.
This patch updates the root.hint zone file to get the new IP number.
This is only security related and not a true vulnerability since the
old server is still operating correctly.
- pcre buffer overflow
Specially crafted regular expressions could lead to a buffer overflow
in the pcre library. Applications using pcre to process regular
expressions from untrusted sources could therefore potentially be
exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-2371).
Only the pcre version on openSUSE 10.3 was affected by this problem
and received fixed packages.
- tomcat55 and tomcat6 cross site scripting problem
tomcat was updated to fix a cross-site-scripting vulnerability in
the host-manager. (CVE-2008-1947)
Since the problem only affects tomcat 5.5 and tomcat 6 only those
were fixed in openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0. Other products were not
affected.
- squid denial of service problem in ASN.1 parsing
Squid was updated to fix an old denial-of-service bug that can
occur while parsing ASN.1 data. (CVE-2004-0918)
More details can be found on:
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2008_1.txt>
Only Squid 3.0 was affected, which is only on openSUSE 11.0 and
was fixed there.
- freetype2 various integer overflows
This update of freetype2 fixes several potential vulnerabilities
reported by iDefense.
CVE-2008-1806: Integer overflow in FreeType2 allows context-dependent
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted set of 16-bit
length values within the Private dictionary table in a Printer Font
Binary (PFB) file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
CVE-2008-1807: FreeType2 allow context-dependent attackers to execute
arbitrary code via an invalid "number of axes" field in a Printer
Font Binary (PFB) file, which triggers a free of arbitrary memory
locations, leading to memory corruption.
CVE-2008-1808: Multiple off-by-one errors in FreeType2 before 2.3.6
allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via
(1) a crafted table in a Printer Font Binary (PFB) file or (2)
a crafted SHC instruction in a TrueType Font (TTF) file, which
triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
Freetype2 was updated on all distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

freetype security update (RHSA-2008-0556)

Original Release Date: August 20, 2008

Last Revised: June 30, 2009

Number: ASA-2008-318

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

FreeType is a freely available portable font engine.

Multiple flaws were discovered in FreeType's Printer Font Binary
(PFB)
font-file format parser. If a user loaded a carefully crafted font-file
with a program linked against FreeType, it could cause the application
to
crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names [CVE-2008-1806](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1806),
[CVE-2008-1807](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1807) and
[CVE-2008-1808](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1808) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0556.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with freetype installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 3.0 | Low | FreeType is not installed in CM 3.1 and later. Upgrade to CM 3.1 or later to resolve this issue. |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | All IALX | Low | This will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya EMMC | EMMC 1.0.0.0.17 | Low | Upgrade to EMMC 1.0.0.0.21 |
| Avaya Voice Portal | VP 3.x and 4.x | Low | FreeType is installed as part of Linux that Avaya ships with Voice Portal, but is not used or supported by Voice Portal. Avaya will not test the recommended patch for VP use since FreeType is not supported.  Customers may upgrade to VP 5.0. |
| Avaya Proactive Contact | PC 4.0, 4.1 | Low | Upgrade to PC 4.1.1 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all vulnerable system products,
Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as the upgrade can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed,
Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by
RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

# About the security content of iPod touch v2.1

This document describes the security content of iPod touch v2.1.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see "[How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25314)."

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see "[Apple Security Updates](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61798)."

#### iPod touch v2.1

* **Application Sandbox**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3631

  Available for: iPod touch v2.0 through v2.0.2

  Impact: An application may be able to read another application's files

  Description: The Application Sandbox does not properly enforce access restrictions between third-party applications. This may allow a third-party application to read files in another third-party application's sandbox and lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by enforcing the proper access restrictions between application sandboxes. Credit to Nicolas Seriot of Sen:te and Bryce Cogswell for reporting this issue. This issue does not affect iPod touch versions prior to v2.0.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-1806, CVE-2008-1807, CVE-2008-1808

  Available for: iPod touch v1.1 through v2.0.2

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in FreeType v2.3.5

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in FreeType v2.3.5, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution when accessing maliciously crafted font data. This update addresses the issue by incorporating the security fixes from version 2.3.6 of FreeType. Further information is available via the FreeType site at <http://www.freetype.org/>

* **mDNSResponder**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-1447

  Available for: iPod touch v1.1 through v2.0.2

  Impact: mDNSResponder is susceptible to DNS cache poisoning and may return forged information

  Description: mDNSResponder provides translation between host names and IP addresses for applications that use its unicast DNS resolution API. A weakness in the DNS protocol may allow a remote attacker to perform DNS cache poisoning attacks. As a result, applications that rely on mDNSResponder for DNS may receive forged information. This update addresses the issue by implementing source port and transaction ID randomization to improve resilience against cache poisoning attacks. Credit to Dan Kaminsky of IOActive for reporting this issue.

* **Networking**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3612

  Available for: iPod touch v1.1 through v2.0.2

  Impact: Predictable TCP initial sequence numbers generation may lead to TCP spoofing or session hijacking

  Description: TCP initial sequence numbers are sequentially generated. Predictable initial sequence numbers may allow a remote attacker to create a spoofed TCP connection or insert data into an existing TCP connection. This update addresses the issue by generating random TCP initial sequence numbers.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3632

  Available for: iPod touch v1.1 through v2.0.2

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
