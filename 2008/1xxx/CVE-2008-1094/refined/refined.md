Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-1094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw present in the `index.cgi` script of Barracuda Spam Firewall.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `pattern_x` parameter within the `index.cgi` script is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, when `filter_x` parameter is set to `search_count_equals`, the application does not properly sanitize user input passed through the `pattern_x` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can potentially disrupt the service by injecting SQL code that causes errors or crashes.
*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by injecting SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   The specific vulnerable URL is: `/cgi-bin/index.cgi`
*   The attack involves manipulating the `pattern_x` parameter along with setting the `filter_x` parameter to `search_count_equals`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Barracuda Spam Firewall to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to reach the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Barracuda Spam Firewall (Firmware v3.5.11.020, Model 600). Other versions/models may also be affected.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to firmware version 3.5.12.001 or contact Barracuda Networks for support.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on June 16, 2008 and a patch was released on December 15, 2008.
*   The exploit-db entry provides a sample attack URL: `/cgi-bin/index.cgi?&user=&password=&et=&auth_type=Local&locale=en_US&realm=&primary_tab=USERS&secondary_tab=per_user_account_view&boolean_0=boolean_and&filter_0=search_count_equals&pattern_0=if(database() like concat(char(99),char(37)),5,0)` This URL demonstrates how to inject SQL code to test for the vulnerability.
