# VLC: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200804-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC, allowing for the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/vlc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.6f** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.6f** |

### Background

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC:

* Luigi Auriemma discovered that the stack-based buffer overflow when
  reading subtitles, which has been reported as CVE-2007-6681 in GLSA
  200803-13, was not properly fixed (CVE-2008-1881).
* Alin Rad Pop of Secunia reported an array indexing vulnerability in the
  sdpplin\_parse() function when processing streams from RTSP servers in
  Xine code, which is also used in VLC (CVE-2008-0073).
* Drew Yao and Nico Golde reported an integer overflow in the
  MP4\_ReadBox\_rdrf() function in the file libmp4.c leading to a
  heap-based buffer overflow when reading MP4 files (CVE-2008-1489).
* Drew Yao also reported integer overflows in the MP4 demuxer,
  the Real demuxer and in the Cinepak codec, which might lead to buffer
  overflows (CVE-2008-1768).
* Drew Yao finally discovered and a
  boundary error in Cinepak, which might lead to memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-1769).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted media
file or stream, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary
code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.8.6f"
```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

---------------------------------------------------
A] buffer-overflow in the handling of the subtitles
---------------------------------------------------
VLC is able to handle the subtitles automatically in a very simple way,
it just checks the presence of ssa files with the same name of the
loaded video and a possible subtitles folder.
The functions which handle the MicroDvd, SSA and Vplayer subtitle
formats are vulnerable to some stack based buffer-overflow
vulnerabilities which can allow an attacker to execute malicious code.
from modules\demux\subtitle.c:
static int ParseMicroDvd( demux\_t \*p\_demux, subtitle\_t \*p\_subtitle )
...
char buffer\_text[MAX\_LINE + 1];
...
if( sscanf( s, "{%d}{}%[^\r\n]", &i\_start, buffer\_text ) == 2 ||
sscanf( s, "{%d}{%d}%[^\r\n]", &i\_start, &i\_stop, buffer\_text ) == 3)
static int ParseSSA( demux\_t \*p\_demux, subtitle\_t \*p\_subtitle )
...
char buffer\_text[ 10 \* MAX\_LINE];
char buffer\_text2[ 10 \* MAX\_LINE];
...
if( sscanf( s,
"Dialogue: %[^,],%d:%d:%d.%d,%d:%d:%d.%d,%[^\r\n]",
buffer\_text2,
&h1, &m1, &s1, &c1,
&h2, &m2, &s2, &c2,
buffer\_text ) == 10 )
UPDATE 16 Mar 2008
in version 0.8.6e we have the following "wrong" change which leaves
buffer\_text2 still vulnerable:
"Dialogue: %[^,],%d:%d:%d.%d,%d:%d:%d.%d,%81920[^\r\n]"
static int ParseVplayer( demux\_t \*p\_demux, subtitle\_t \*p\_subtitle )
...
char buffer\_text[MAX\_LINE + 1];
...
if( sscanf( p, "%d:%d:%d%[ :]%[^\r\n]", &h, &m, &s, &c, buffer\_text ) == 5 )
As written in the header of this advisory, these buffer-overflow bugs
have been originally found and reported by Michal Luczaj this summer
and the strange thing is that the SVN is fixed from that time BUT the
current 0.8.6d (both executables and source code!) is still vulnerable.

-------------------------------------
B] format string in the web interface
-------------------------------------
VLC can be controlled remotely through a nice web interface (a mini
http server which must be manually activated) that runs by default on
port 8080.
The instructions which handle the Connection parameter sent by the
client pass its content to the httpd\_MsgAdd function without the
needed format argument.
In addition the new formatted Connection field is also sent back by the
server in its reply, very useful for the attacker to tune the own
exploit for increasing the percentage of success of the attack.
from network\httpd.c:
static int httpd\_FileCallBack( httpd\_callback\_sys\_t \*p\_sys, httpd\_client\_t \*cl, httpd\_message\_t \*answer, httpd\_message\_t \*query )

psz\_connection = httpd\_MsgGet( &cl->query, "Connection" );

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# VLC: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-13**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC, allowing for the execution of
arbitrary code and Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/vlc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.6e** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.6e** |

### Background

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC:

* Michal Luczaj
  and Luigi Auriemma reported that VLC contains boundary errors when
  handling subtitles in the ParseMicroDvd(), ParseSSA(), and
  ParseVplayer() functions in the modules/demux/subtitle.c file, allowing
  for a stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-6681).
* The web
  interface listening on port 8080/tcp contains a format string error in
  the httpd\_FileCallBack() function in the network/httpd.c file
  (CVE-2007-6682).
* The browser plugin possibly contains an
  argument injection vulnerability (CVE-2007-6683).
* The RSTP
  module triggers a NULL pointer dereference when processing a request
  without a "Transport" parameter (CVE-2007-6684).
* Luigi
  Auriemma and Remi Denis-Courmont found a boundary error in the
  modules/access/rtsp/real\_sdpplin.c file when processing SDP data for
  RTSP sessions (CVE-2008-0295) and a vulnerability in the
  libaccess\_realrtsp plugin (CVE-2008-0296), possibly resulting in a
  heap-based buffer overflow.
* Felipe Manzano and Anibal Sacco
  (Core Security Technologies) discovered an arbitrary memory overwrite
  vulnerability in VLC's MPEG-4 file format parser (CVE-2008-0984).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a long subtitle in a file that a user is
enticed to open, a specially crafted MP4 input file, long SDP data, or
a specially crafted HTTP request with a "Connection" header value
containing format specifiers, possibly resulting in the remote
execution of arbitrary code. Also, a Denial of Service could be caused
and arbitrary files could be overwritten via the "demuxdump-file"
option in a filename in a playlist or via an EXTVLCOPT statement in an
MP3 file.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.8.6e"
```
