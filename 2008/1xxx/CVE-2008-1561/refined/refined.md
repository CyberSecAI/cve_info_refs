```
Root cause of vulnerability:
- The X.509sat dissector has an uninitialized variable, and the Roofnet dissector has a NULL pointer passed to the g_vsnprintf() function.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Uninitialized variable in X.509sat dissector.
- NULL pointer dereference in Roofnet dissector.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of service (application crash)

Attack vectors:
- Sending a malformed packet or enticing a user to read a malformed packet trace file.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Remote attacker capable of sending malformed packets or an attacker who can convince a user to open a malicious capture file.
