{
  "CVE-2008-1480": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The Solaris rpc.metad(1M) daemon is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "The rpc.metad daemon does not properly handle certain requests, leading to a denial of service."
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted RPC request to the rpc.metad daemon, making the system unresponsive.",
       "Attack vectors": [
         "Network based attack by sending crafted RPC requests."
       ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system and have knowledge about the RPC protocol and the specific vulnerability."
      ],
        "Additional Information": "The provided exploit code sends a large string to the vulnerable daemon via RPC, triggering the vulnerability. The vulnerability is present in Solstice Disk Suite 4.2.1, Solaris 9 and 10, and OpenSolaris. Avaya products such as Avaya CMS and Avaya IR are also affected if running on a vulnerable Sun Microsystems operating system."
