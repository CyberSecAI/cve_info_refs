    "CVE ID": "CVE-2008-1496",
    "Source": "www.exploit-db.com_4145c9aa_20250124_232605.html",
    "Root cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in PEEL CMS",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Insecure default credentials",
       "Magic Quotes GPC bypass",
	  "Arbitrary file upload"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution via arbitrary file upload. Extraction of admin credentials via SQL injection and password cracking.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "HTTP requests to vulnerable pages"
    ],
	"Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send HTTP requests to the target system. No prior authentication required to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.",
	"More details": "The exploit attempts multiple attack vectors. First, it tries to login using default credentials. Then, it attempts to bypass magic quotes to perform SQL injection. Next it tries SQL injection to extract user information including password hashes. If successful, it tries to crack the password hash using online services. Finally, it uses successful login to add a fake product and upload a backdoor php file using a vulnerability in the file upload mechanism of product images."
