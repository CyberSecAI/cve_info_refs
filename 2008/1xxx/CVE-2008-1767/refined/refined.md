Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-1767:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A heap buffer overflow exists in the `libxslt` library. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when processing an XSL style sheet file with a long XSLT "transformation match" condition that results in a large number of steps being processed. The `xsltCompMatch` structure has a statically allocated `steps` array of size 40 which is overflowed when processing a long "transformation match" condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The `xsltCompMatch` structure contains a fixed-size array for storing steps in processing transformations.  When the number of steps exceeds this limit, a buffer overflow occurs in the heap memory.
*  **Uninitialized Memory Usage:** Due to the overflow, the code attempts to free memory that is not part of the allocated buffer potentially leading to accessing uninitialized memory which can cause a crash or worse.
*   **Incorrect memory management** In `xsltFreeCompMatch`, the code iterates through the number of steps present and attempts to free the memory associated with each of them. When `nbStep` is higher than expected, it accesses and tries to free memory out of the bounds of the allocated array potentially triggering a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious XSL style sheet, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable application.
*   **Application Termination/Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to unexpected application termination or a crash, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious XML/XSL Documents:** The vulnerability is exploited by providing a specially crafted XSLT stylesheet to an application that uses the `libxslt` library, often via processing an XML document with a vulnerable xslt style sheet.
*   **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can induce a user or automated system to process a malicious XML/XSL file.
*   **Local Attack** A local attacker can provide a malicious xml/xsl file to a vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to make the vulnerable application process a malicious XML document and corresponding XSL style sheet. This could occur by enticing a user to open a webpage/file with malicious code.
*  No special privileges are required to execute this attack, merely the ability to make the vulnerable program execute the specially crafted files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Anthony de Almeida Lopes of Outpost24 AB, and Chris Evans of the Google Security Team.
*   The vulnerability affects applications using `libxslt` library to process XML/XSL files.
*   The vulnerability exists due to improper bounds checking when handling long "transformation match" conditions in XSLT style sheets.
*   The fix involves correctly handling the size of transformation matches and preventing access to out-of-bounds memory.
