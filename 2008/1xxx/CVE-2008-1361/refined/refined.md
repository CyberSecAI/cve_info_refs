Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-1361:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecurely created named pipe objects within the VMware product line on Windows systems. Specifically, it involves the `authd` process, which is susceptible to exploitation through named pipes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Named Pipes:** The primary weakness is the insecure creation of named pipe objects. This allows a malicious user to create and control a named pipe that the `authd` process can connect to.
*   **Improper Privilege Handling:** The `authd` process can be tricked into connecting to a malicious named pipe, which allows an attacker to impersonate the `authd` process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious Windows user can escalate privileges to LocalSystem by forcing `authd` to connect to the attacker-controlled named pipe.
*   **Impersonation of `authd`:**  Attackers can impersonate the `authd` process, gaining the privileges that `authd` runs under.
*   **Denial of Service:** It is also mentioned that the insecure named pipe could be exploited for a denial of service attack, although details of this are not provided.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** This vulnerability is exploitable by a malicious user who has local access to the Windows system where the vulnerable VMware product is installed.
*   **Named Pipe Hijacking:** The attack involves creating a malicious named pipe and manipulating the VMware authd process to connect to it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires a user account on the Windows system where the affected VMware product is installed.
*   **Ability to Create Named Pipes:** The attacker must be able to create and control named pipes on the system.
*   **Knowledge of authd Process:** The attacker needs to understand how the authd process interacts with named pipes to conduct the attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Windows-based installations of VMware products.
*   The advisory from Vmware indicates that an internal security audit identified the issue.
*   The VMware advisory also notes that the issue is resolved in specific versions of their products including VMware Workstation, Player, Server and ACE.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability described by CVE-2008-1361.
