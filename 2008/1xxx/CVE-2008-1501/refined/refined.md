{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `send_user_mode` function in `s_user.c` does not validate the presence of an argument after a '+r' mode. Absence of this argument can lead to missing the NULL sentinel, causing the function to iterate beyond the array's boundaries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing argument check",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability leads to a crash of the IRC server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted MODE command to the IRC server"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker can send commands to the IRC server. No authentication is required."
  },
  "affected_software": [
    "ircu (up to and including 2.10.12.12)",
    "snircd (up to and including 1.3.4)",
