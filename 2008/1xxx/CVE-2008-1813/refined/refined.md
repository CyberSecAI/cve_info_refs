  "CVE-2008-1813": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Hardcoded password in the `DBMS_STATS_INTERNAL` package.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded password, insecure default configuration, privilege escalation.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could gain DBA privileges by exploiting the hardcoded password of the OUTLN user.",
      "Attack vectors": "Creating a materialized view triggers the vulnerable code in the `DBMS_STATS_INTERNAL` package, which resets the OUTLN user password to 'OUTLN' and grants it DBA privileges.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to create a materialized view within the Oracle database. If the OUTLN account is unlocked, a malicious actor may trigger the vulnerability."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "SQL injection vulnerability in the SDO_GEOM package.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands by injecting malicious code.",
      "Attack vectors": "Vulnerable package SDO_GEOM in Oracle Spatial",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position":"An attacker needs to be able to interact with the affected SDO_GEOM package, a part of the Oracle Spatial component."
