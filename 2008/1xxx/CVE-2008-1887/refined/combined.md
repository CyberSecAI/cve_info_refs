| [Description](#c0)  Scott A. Friedman    2002-04-27 17:49:18 UTC  ``` Speaks for itself...  Compiled fine under 2.4.19-r1, I used the default .config file made sure SMP  was on and ACPI. Tried it with low latency on and off.  PS - the first release of gentoo-sources is a real headache! ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-28 01:57:46 UTC  ``` This was a bug in the -pre7-ac2 kernel itself and I'm submitting the one-liner fix for the problem upstream to Alan Cox. As you might guess, this'll be fixed in the next gentoo-sources release.  I'm sorry it was such a headache to experience this bug and we're doing everything we can to ensure that our kernels are of the highest possible quality.  You can apply this one-liner patch to fix the problem (backup your .config and do a "make mrproper", cp config back, "make oldconfig", "make dep" after patching it):  --- linux-2.4.18-pre7-ac2/drivers/acpi/ospm/system/sm_osl.c     Sun Apr 28 00:38:59 2002 +++ linux-2.4.19-gentoo/drivers/acpi/ospm/system/sm_osl.c       Sun Apr 28 00:27:58 2002 @@ -35,6 +35,7 @@  #include <asm/io.h>  #include <linux/mc146818rtc.h>  #include <linux/delay.h> +#include <linux/suspend.h>    #include <acpi.h>  #include "sm.h"  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-30 12:00:28 UTC  ``` will be fixed under gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r1 (fixing it up now) ``` |  |

# Python: Multiple integer overflows — GLSA **200807-01**

Multiple integer overflows may allow for Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/python** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.4-r13** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.3.6-r6**>= **2.4.4-r13** |

### Background

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Python:

* David
  Remahl reported multiple integer overflows in the file imageop.c,
  leading to a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2008-1679). This issue is
  due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-4965.
* Justin Ferguson
  discovered that an integer signedness error in the zlib extension
  module might trigger insufficient memory allocation and a buffer
  overflow via a negative signed integer (CVE-2008-1721).
* Justin
  Ferguson discovered that insufficient input validation in the
  PyString\_FromStringAndSize() function might lead to a buffer overflow
  (CVE-2008-1887).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a Denial
of Service or possibly the remote execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Python.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

The imageop module is no longer built in the unaffected versions.

All Python 2.3 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.3.6-r6"
```

All Python 2.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.4.4-r13"
```

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- powerdns spoofing problems
The PowerDNS packages were updated to offer better spoofing
resistance by not ignoring invalid queries. (CVE-2008-3337)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- dnsmasq spoofing problems
The DNS server dnsmasq was changed to use random UDP source ports
and a random TRXID now. (CVE-2008-1447)
This problem only affected openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- python multiple problems
The scripting language python was updated to fix several security
vulnerabilities. (CVE-2008-1679,CVE-2008-1887, CVE-2008-3143,
CVE-2008-3142, CVE-2008-3144, CVE-2008-2315, CVE-2008-2316)
All SUSE Linux products received updated python packages.
- mailman cross site scripting
The mailing list manager mailman was updated to fix a
cross-site-scripting bug (CVE-2008-0564) and a mistake in
translation.
All distributions containing mailman received updated packages.
- ruby multiple problems
The scripting language ruby was updated to fix:
- a possible information leakage (CVE-2008-1145)
- a directory traversal bug (CVE-2008-1891) in WEBrick
- various memory corruptions and integer overflows in array and
string handling (CVE-2008-2662, CVE-2008-2663, CVE-2008-2664,
CVE-2008-2725, CVE-2008-2726, CVE-2008-2727, CVE-2008-2728)
ruby was updated on all SUSE Linux products.
- Opera 9.52
Opera was upgraded to version 9.52 to fix possible security
vulnerabilities.
Please see <http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/952/> for
more details.
- neon NULL pointer problem
The helper library neon was updated to fix a NULL pointer dereference
in the digest authentication code. (CVE-2008-3746)
neon was updated on all affected distributions.
- rxvt-unicode session hijacking
Using rxvt-unicode it was possible to open a terminal on :0 when
the environment variable was not set.
This could be exploited by local users to hijack X11 connections (CVE-2008-1142).
rxvt-unicode was updated on openSUSE 10.2-11.0.
- perl multiple problems
Several problems were fixed in the scripting language perl.
Specially crafted regular expressions could crash perl
(CVE-2008-1927).
Insufficient symlink checks in the File::Path could result in wrong
file permissions (CVE-2008-2827).
Additionally problem in the CGI module was fixed that could result
in an endless loop if uploads were canceled.
- Wireshark / ethereal multiple security problems
Various vulnerabilities have been fixed in ethereal and wireshark:
CVE-2008-3137, CVE-2008-3138, CVE-2008-3139,
CVE-2008-3140, CVE-2008-3141, CVE-2008-3145
and CVE-2008-3146. Those could be potentially used to crash
wireshark or potentially execute code.
Updates have been released for all SUSE Linux distributions.
- namazu cross site scripting
The indexing engine namazu was upgraded to fix a UTF-7
cross-site-scripting vulnerability. (CVE-2008-1468)
namazu was updated on all products containing it.
- gnome-screensaver clipboard disclosure
gnome-screensaver was updated to disallows local users to
read the contents of the clipboard for a locked screen using
ctrl-v. (CVE-2007-6389)
Updates have been released for openSUSE 10.3, other distributions
were not affected.
- MySQL security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix a security problem:
CVE-2008-2079: MySQL allowed local users to bypass certain privilege
checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1)
DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within
the MySQL home data directory, which can point to tables that are
created in the future.
CVE-2006-7232: sql\_select.cc in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.32 and 5.1.x
before 5.1.14 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA
table, as originally demonstrated using ORDER BY.
MySQL was updated on all SUSE Linux distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Package        : python2.5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1679 CVE-2008-1721 CVE-2008-1887

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Python language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2007-2052

    Piotr Engelking discovered that the strxfrm() function of the locale
    module miscalculates the length of an internal buffer, which may
    result in a minor information disclosure.

CVE-2007-4965

    It was discovered that several integer overflows in the imageop
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, if a user is
    tricked into processing malformed images. This issue is also
    tracked as CVE-2008-1679 due to an initially incomplete patch.

CVE-2008-1721

    Justin Ferguson discovered that a buffer overflow in the zlib
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1887

    Justin Ferguson discovered that insufficient input validation in
    PyString_FromStringAndSize() may lead to the execution of arbitrary
    code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5-5+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.2-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.5 packages.

Package        : python2.4
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1679 CVE-2008-1721 CVE-2008-1887

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Python language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2007-2052

    Piotr Engelking discovered that the strxfrm() function of the locale
    module miscalculates the length of an internal buffer, which may
    result in a minor information disclosure.

CVE-2007-4965

    It was discovered that several integer overflows in the imageop
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, if a user is
    tricked into processing malformed images. This issue is also
    tracked as CVE-2008-1679 due to an initially incomplete patch.

CVE-2008-1721

    Justin Ferguson discovered that a buffer overflow in the zlib
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1887

    Justin Ferguson discovered that insufficient input validation in
    PyString_FromStringAndSize() may lead to the execution of arbitrary
    code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.4-3+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.5-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.4 packages.

| ``` The PyString_FromStringAndSize() function takes a pointer and signed integer as input parameters however it fails to adequately check the sanity of the integer argument. Because of the failure to check for negative values and because it sums the integer with the size of the PyStringObject structure it becomes possible for the allocator to take either of the code paths in PyObject_MALLOC()-- both of which will incorrectly allocate memory.  This may not seem like a big deal, but I'm posting this instead of filing a bug for every place this screws you guys over.  if (0 > len || len > PYSSIZE_T_MAX/sizeof(PyStringObject))          return NULL; ``` | | | |

| ``` This is done already: the second line in PyString_FromStringAndSize() is     assert(size>=0); You have to build python in debug mode though...  Oh, I realize this is not a real patch: no error is raised, and why PYSSIZE_T_MAX/sizeof(PyStringObject), when the allocation is     PyObject_MALLOC(sizeof(PyStringObject)+size)? ``` | | | |

| ``` The problem with assert()'s is they require debugging to be enabled, obviously, who compiles it that way?  You may not even want to worry about the second check, when you pass it into the allocator it gets converted to an unsigned int which will cause the allocator to either fail (32-bit) or allocate more memory than expected-- either cause it handled/benign.  If you'd prefer I can file every place where this actually bites you guys, I was just trying to be nice. ``` | | | |

| ``` As an addemdum, consider the following code (theres no assert, but it wouldnt have helped you outside of debug builds anyways):   488 static PyObject *PySSL_SSLread(PySSLObject *self, PyObject *args) 489 { 490         PyObject *buf; 491         int count = 0; 492         int len = 1024; [...] 496         if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "|i:read", &len)) 497                 return NULL; 498  499         if (!(buf = PyString_FromStringAndSize((char *) 0, len))) 500                 return NULL; [...] 521                 count = SSL_read(self->ssl, PyString_AsString(buf), len); ``` | | | |

| ``` I agree that PySSL_SSLread should check that its argument is >= 0.  I  don't think this check belongs to PyString_FromStringAndSize.   It  should be the responsibility of the caller to verify that the  precondition size >= 0 is satisfied before calling PyString_FromStringAndSize.  Oftentimes the caller can ascertain size >=  0 without an explicit check, for example, if size is the size of a  buffer or length of a valid string object.  On the other hand, an external input such as the len argument to the  read function should be checked before used.  I would also suggest changing the len type from int to Py_ssize_t.  I agree with Amaury that assert(size>=0) is sufficient in PyString_FromStringAndSize(), but its documentation should emphasize  that the caller is responsible for assuring that the requested length is   nonnegative.  I don't think the upper bound check is necessary: sizeof(PyStringObject)  + size will not wrap around as long as size >= 0. ``` | | | |

Since the fixes are likely to be one-line changes, I would say there is no need to create separate issues.  Just post a patch here for а review.  From your other post, I understand that you are doing a security audit of the python codebase.  Is this a manual effort (identifying unsafe constructs and searching for them) or you use some kind of automation? ``` | | | |

I don't have a strong view on this, but just a few points to consider:  1. If you change PyString_FromStringAndSize, you should change PyBytes_FromStringAndSize and PyUnicode_FromStringAndSize for consistency.  2. Non-debug check should probably set a ValueError exception and return NULL.  Think what kind of message you can generate inside *_FromStringAndSize that would be helpful to the end user.  The caller is likely to be able to provide a much better diagnostic.  3. Maybe instead of setting a ValueError, a SystemError should be raised.  In this case the calle will still be clearly responsible for the pre-condition, but programming errors will not present security concerns.  4. You have clearly identified several bugs that are not covered by unittests.  If you fix them en-mass by making PyString_FromStringAndSize more forgiving, we will miss an opportunity to improve the test coverage. (If you take the SystemError approach, this does not apply.) ``` | | | |

Okay, if we don't patch the API call itself, I will look at the users of those two API calls as well, I haven't gone through much of the stuff in Objects/ yet, I focused on the modules obviously and thus didn't know about those calls.  > 4.

| ``` The use of signed integers in Python is (imho) the single largest threat to the security of the interpreter. I'm probably preaching to the choir there though.   I really dislike have to return values and indicate error in the return value, its really unclean and causes weirdness, for instance if you follow PyArg_ParseTuple() down and you have an integer (or maybe it was long?) argument, you can't actually get a value of -1 because one of the string->int conversion routines uses that to indicate failure. The check wrapped around it was something along the lines of:  if (-1 == retval && PyErr_Occurred())  In turn down the line somewhere (I didn't follow the code path), this value got converted to 1, so for instance doing __import__('zlib').decompressobj().flush(-1) wouldn't trigger that bug, it would flush 1 byte, not UINT_MAX as I had expected ``` | | | |

| ``` The asserts can go.  I left them in figuring a crashing interpreter on a debug build in someones sandbox or on a buildbox would get more attention than a SystemError being raised.  I doubt that is a worthy assumption on my part.  Both a crash and a SystemError are notable events.  shall I get rid of the asserts?  As for why i dislike signed size types... tons of reasons:  * It wastes half the range of the integer.  * It leads to security bugs.  * on return values -1 and < 0 tests may be convenient to type but they     could just as easily compare to a known value defined as a constant;     all the things alexander belopolsky suggested.  * sizes being passed -in- to a function never need to be negative    meaning safe code requires extra checks like these.  * sign extension of values going between registers of different sizes    is needlessly expensive on some cpu architectures.  use unsigned    types whenever possible for the best code.  anyways, I figure the Python C API is already set in stone using the signed types so its too late to "fix" it without causing headaches around the world. ``` | | | |

| ``` Please do get rid of the asserts.  Regarding signed sizes, it's a historic accident (copied from Unix system calls which tended to use plain ints or longs in the olden days), but it may not be impossible to fix -- we've fixed other things throughout the code (e.g. switching from int to Py_ssize_t).  It'll be a monumental task though that's probably best tackled post-3.0. ``` | | | |

## Details

It was discovered that there were new integer overflows in the imageop

module. If an attacker were able to trick a Python application into

processing a specially crafted image, they could execute arbitrary code

with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1679](/security/CVE-2008-1679))

Justin Ferguson discovered that the zlib module did not correctly

handle certain archives. If an attacker were able to trick a Python

application into processing a specially crafted archive file, they could

execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1721](/security/CVE-2008-1721))

Justin Ferguson discovered that certain string manipulations in Python

could be made to overflow. If an attacker were able to pass a specially

crafted string through the PyString\_FromStringAndSize function, they

could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1887](/security/CVE-2008-1887))

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Python's core and modules

including hashlib, binascii, pickle, md5, stringobject, unicodeobject,

bufferobject, longobject, tupleobject, stropmodule, gcmodule, and

mmapmodule. If an attacker were able to exploit these flaws they could

execute arbitrary code with user privileges or cause Python applications

to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-2315](/security/CVE-2008-2315), [CVE-2008-2316](/security/CVE-2008-2316),

c. Third party library update for ntp.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0 have a ntp client that is affected by the
following security issue. Note that the same security issue is
present in the ESX Service Console as described in section d. of
this advisory.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
The NTP security issue identified by CVE-2009-0159 is not relevant
for ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
in this component (column 4) if a solution is available.

d. Service Console update for ntp

Service Console package ntp updated to version ntp-4.2.2pl-9el5\_3.2
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
The Service Console present in ESX is affected by the following
security issues.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
NTP authentication is not enabled by default on the Service Console.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
A buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A
malicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an
ntpq request that could crash ntpq or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ntpq
command.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0159 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
in the Service Console (column 4) if a solution is available.

f. Updated Service Console package python

Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.
When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service.
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service.
An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721
CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143

g. Updated Service Console package bind

Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5
The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
is operating correctly.
A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.

#####

h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
files.

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these
issues.

i. Updated Service Console package curl

Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5\_3.5
A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.

j. Updated Service Console package gnutls

Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5\_3.5
A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially
confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.
