# Dovecot: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-25**

Two vulnerabilities in Dovecot allow for information disclosure and
argument injection.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-mail/dovecot** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.13-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.13-r1** |

### Background

Dovecot is a lightweight, fast and easy to configure IMAP and POP3 mail
server.

### Description

Dovecot uses the group configured via the "mail\_extra\_groups" setting,
which should be used to create lockfiles in the /var/mail directory,
when accessing arbitrary files (CVE-2008-1199). Dovecot does not escape
TAB characters in passwords when saving them, which might allow for
argument injection in blocking passdbs such as MySQL, PAM or shadow
(CVE-2008-1218).

### Impact

Remote attackers can exploit the first vulnerability to disclose
sensitive data, such as the mail of other users, or modify files or
directories that are writable by group via a symlink attack. Please
note that the "mail\_extra\_groups" setting is set to the "mail" group by
default when the "mbox" USE flag is enabled.

The second vulnerability can be abused to inject arguments for internal
fields. No exploitation vectors are known for this vulnerability that
affect previously stable versions of Dovecot in Gentoo.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Dovecot users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/dovecot-1.0.13-r1"
```

This version removes the "mail\_extra\_groups" option and introduces a
"mail\_privileged\_group" setting which is handled safely.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- dovecot
When configured with 'mail\_extra\_groups' dovecot potentially allowed
users to read mail boxes of other users. This is not the
case in the default configuration of openSUSE (CVE-2008-1199).
By using tab characters in passwords remote attackers could
potentially acquire unauthorized access (CVE-2008-1218).
Flaws in caching LDAP data could lead to users getting logged in
with the wrong account (CVE-2007-6598).
Affected: 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- GraphicsMagick
Specially crafted image files could crash GraphicsMagick (CVE-2008-3134).
Affected: 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- openssh
Due to a faulty signal handler repeated login attempts could exhaust
the maximum allowed connections and prevent further logins
(CVE-2008-4109).
A problem where utmp entries where not deleted when users logged
out was also fixed.
Affected: SLES10
- mercurial
The hgweb script didn't enforce the 'allowpull' permission setting
which allowed anyone to retrieve files from the repository
(CVE-2008-4297)
Affected: 11.0

SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1516-1                security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Florian Weimer
March 14, 2008                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : dovecot
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1199 CVE-2008-1218
Debian Bug     : 469457

Prior to this update, the default configuration for Dovecot used by
Debian runs the server daemons with group mail privileges.  This means
that users with write access to their mail directory by other means
(for example, through an SSH login) could read mailboxes owned by
other users for which they do not have direct write access
(CVE-2008-1199).  In addition, an internal interpretation conflict in
password handling has been addressed proactively, even though it is
not known to be exploitable (CVE-2008-1218).

Note that applying this update requires manual action: The
configuration setting "mail_extra_groups = mail" has been replaced
with "mail_privileged_group = mail".  The update will show a
configuration file conflict in /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.  It is
recommended that you keep the currently installed configuration file,
and change the affected line.  For your reference, the sample
configuration (without your local changes) will have been written to
/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.dpkg-new.

If your current configuration uses mail_extra_groups with a value
different from "mail", you may have to resort to the
mail_access_groups configuration directive.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.rc15-2etch4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.13-1.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), no updates are provided.
We recommend that you consider upgrading to the stable distribution.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

	  functionality use mail_access_groups instead.

	- mbox: Dropped some of the physical size fetch optimizations added
	  in v1.0.8. This makes some commands slower, but should fix the rest

	- ldap: auth_bind was doing lookups using subtree scope instead of
	  the scope specified in config file.
	- zlib plugin crashfixes by Richard Platel
	- master passdbs: pass=yes setting was broken with blocking passdbs
