{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities in PEEL CMS, including SQL injection, insecure default credentials, and lack of input sanitization, leading to admin hash extraction and arbitrary file upload.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection: Exploitable through the 'achat/historique_commandes.php' and 'factures/facture_html.php' pages to extract admin credentials (email and password hash).",
    "Insecure Default Credentials: Default admin credentials can be used to gain access.",
	"Magic Quotes Bypass: The exploit attempts to bypass magic_quotes_gpc setting.",
    "Insecure File Upload: Vulnerable to arbitrary file upload through the product image upload functionality (specifically the image3 and pdf fields when adding a new product).",
    "Lack of Input Sanitization: Vulnerable to SQL injection by not sanitizing user-supplied parameters."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain administrator access to the PEEL CMS, extract admin password hashes, and upload arbitrary files (e.g., PHP shell) to achieve remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET/POST requests",
    "SQL injection through vulnerable parameters in URL",
    "Form data submissions for file uploads"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable PEEL CMS installation.",
    "No prior authentication is needed initially if exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability or using default credentials; however, valid credentials or successfully extracted credentials will be required to trigger the file upload.",
	"Ability to send HTTP requests"
  ]
