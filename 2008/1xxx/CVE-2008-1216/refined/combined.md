description:Lotus Quickr, announced at Lotusphere 2007, is an evolution of Lotus QuickPlace ,The software use a weak xss filter that an attacker can bypass this xss filter. A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate from the site running the IBM Lotus Quickr 8.0 software and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.
IBM Quickr 8.0 Server Calender XSS Injection:
its seems that IBM Lotus Quickvr use a filter xss,an attacker can avoid this filter .
example of IBM Quickr 8.0 XSS filter:
http://victim.com/QuickPlace/main.nsf/h\_Toc/2a922d48c75dd00b052567080016
723a/?OpenDocument&Count='20"><script>alert('g')</script>
and then you will get a error message from Quickr:
Due to the presence of characters known to be used in Cross Site Scripting attacks, access is forbidden. This web site does not allow Urls which might include embedded HTML tags.
IBM Quickr 8.0 calender XSS (Avoid weak XSS filter) POC:
http://victim.com/QuickPlace/main.nsf/h\_Toc/2a922d48c75dd00b052567080016
723a/?OpenDocument&Count='20"><iframe/%20/onload=alert(/XSSByNirG/)>

| Waiting for details | [**CVE-2024-48919**](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2024-48919/ "CVE-2024-48919") | **Updating...** | [Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Prior to Sep 27, 2024, if a user generated a terminal command via Cursor's Terminal Cmd-K/Ctrl-K feature and if the user explicitly imported a malicious web page into the Terminal Cmd-K prompt, an attacker with control over the referenced web page could have a significant chance of influencing a language model to output arbitrary commands for execution in the user's terminal. This scenario would require the user explicitly opt-in to including the contents of a compromised webpage, and it would require that the attacker display prompt injection text in the the contents of the compromised webpage. A server-side patch to not stream back newlines or control characters was released on September 27, 2024, within two hours of the issue being reported. Additionally, Cursor 0.42 includes client-side mitigations to prevent any newline or control character from being streamed into the terminal directly. It also contains a new setting, `"cursor.terminal.usePreviewBox"`, which, if set to true, streams the response into a preview box whose contents then have to be manually accepted before being inserted into the terminal. This setting is useful if you're working in a shell environment where commands can be executed without pressing enter or any control character. The patch has been applied server-side, so no additional action is needed, even on older versions of Cursor. Separately, Cursor's maintainers also recommend, as best practice, to only include trusted pieces of context in prompts.](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2024-48919/ "Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI.

A potential vulnerability has been identified in the input validation process, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited. This issue could allow an attacker to submit malicious input data, bypassing input validation, resulting in remote code execution in certain machine learning applications using the ACON library. All users utilizing ACON�??s input-handling functions are potentially at risk. Specifically, machine learning models or applications that ingest user-generated data without proper sanitization are the most vulnerable. Users running ACON on production servers are at heightened risk, as the vulnerability could be exploited remotely. As of time of publication, it is unclear whether a fix is available.](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2024-49361/ "ACON is a widely-used library of tools for machine learning that focuses on adaptive correlation optimization.
