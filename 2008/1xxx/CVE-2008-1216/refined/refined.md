  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The IBM Lotus Quickr 8.0 server (and possibly QuickPlace 7.x) does not properly sanitize URIs, specifically the 'Count' parameter, allowing for the injection of cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"

    "impact": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the context of the vulnerable web application. This could allow for cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities within the user's browser.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted URL is used to inject malicious JavaScript code via the 'Count' parameter of a Calendar OpenDocument action.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a URL with the malicious payload and get a victim to load it. No authentication is needed."
