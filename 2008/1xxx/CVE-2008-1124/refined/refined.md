  "CVE-2008-1124": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to both Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Local File Disclosure vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and improper handling of user-supplied parameters.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application includes files based on user-supplied URLs through the `absoluteurl` parameter without proper sanitization.",
        "Local File Disclosure: The application discloses local files through the `theme_path` and `filename` parameters without proper sanitization, allowing directory traversal using `../` sequences."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can include arbitrary remote files (RFI), potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. Additionally, they can disclose local files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd` (Local File Disclosure), which can expose sensitive information about the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "For RFI, attackers can inject malicious PHP code by specifying an external URL containing the malicious script through the `absoluteurl` parameter in multiple vulnerable scripts.",
        "For Local File Disclosure, attackers can use directory traversal sequences like `../../` in the `theme_path` or `filename` parameters to access sensitive files."
      ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "Attackers need the ability to send HTTP requests with the crafted vulnerable parameters to the targeted application. No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerabilities."
