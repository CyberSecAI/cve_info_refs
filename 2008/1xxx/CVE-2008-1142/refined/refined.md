{
  "CVE-2008-1142": {
    "Description": "The rxvt terminal emulator, and possibly other terminal emulators, opens an X11 terminal on display :0 if the DISPLAY environment variable is not set, which allows local users to hijack X11 sessions of other users.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The rxvt terminal emulator, and others, would default to display :0 if the DISPLAY environment variable was not set.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The terminal emulator did not check if the DISPLAY environment was set and defaulted to :0.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can hijack the X11 session of another user by opening a terminal on :0.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can exploit the vulnerability by running the terminal emulator without setting the DISPLAY environment variable.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a local user on the system."
