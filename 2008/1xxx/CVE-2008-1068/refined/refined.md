```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to both local and remote file inclusion due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information (like /etc/passwd). An attacker can include remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution by including attacker-controlled PHP files.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application, manipulating the 'site_path' and 'page' parameters.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. For RFI, they also need to host a malicious file on a server accessible to the target application. For LFI, they need to be able to access the application using HTTP and then input the local path."
