Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure retrieval and execution of "rule scripts" by InstallShield Update Agent (also known as Macrovision FLEXnet Connect, and Acresso FLEXnet Connect). These scripts, used to determine if software updates are relevant, are downloaded over unencrypted HTTP, without any signature or verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Communication:** The use of HTTP for retrieving scripts makes the communication susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks.
*   **Lack of Authentication and Integrity Checks:** The scripts are not signed or otherwise verified, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The client executes the retrieved scripts, making it possible for an attacker to run arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** The attacker gains the ability to install malware, download additional malicious payloads, and perform other actions, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.
*   **Silent Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited transparently without the user's knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Update Servers:** Attackers could compromise the FLEXnet Connect servers directly.
*   **Malicious Proxies:** Attackers could filter client traffic through a malicious proxy to inject malicious code into the rule scripts.
*   **DNS Attacks:** Attackers can compromise DNS servers or modify host name lookups to redirect clients to malicious servers.
*   **ActiveX Exploitation:** Attackers can use malicious websites with ActiveX controls to trigger the exploit on vulnerable systems, potentially combined with MiTM techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Position:** The attacker can be remote and does not require local access to the target system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or modify network traffic between the vulnerable client and the FLEXnet Connect servers.
*   **Ability to Modify Network Traffic or DNS:** The attacker needs the ability to perform MiTM attacks, control malicious proxies, or influence DNS resolution.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects software using InstallShield/FLEXnet Connect for updates.
*   The update check may occur on a periodic basis, at application launch, or through a manual check.
*   A patch was released (FLEXnet Connect 11.0.1 client with agent.exe version 11.1.100.17104) that introduces certificate verification of the server, but it might not be immediately deployed by all vendors.
*   Workarounds include blocking `/GetRules.asp` requests, disabling vulnerable ActiveX controls, or restricting access to the FLEXnet client components.
*   Multiple vendors were affected, including IBM, Corel, and Roxio.
