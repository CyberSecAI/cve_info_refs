How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## InstallShield / Macrovision / Acresso FLEXnet Connect insecurely retrieves and executes scripts

#### Vulnerability Note VU#837092

Original Release Date: 2008-09-16 | Last Revised: 2008-11-28

---

### Overview

Acresso FLEXnet Connect executes scripts that are insecurely retrieved from a remote web server, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Acresso FLEXnet Connect is a software package that allows vendors to provide updates to applications. FLEXnet Connect-enabled software has the ability to     + Check for updates from the software publisher + Receive update files and messages from the software publisher + Install software updates, including the ability to do so silently + Collect and transmit system information, such as machine name, operating system, IP address, or other hardware details, such as network or video card properties + Log and transmit each time an application is started, terminated, or when a specific feature within the application is used  Acresso FLEXnet Connect was formerly known as Macrovision FLEXnet Connect, and before that it was known as InstallShield Update Service.The FLEXnet Connect client software communicates with centralized servers to check for updates and other product information on a periodic basis. Updates can also be triggered by using Internet Explorer to visit a web page that uses the FLEXnet Connect ActiveX control, which is provided by agent.exe. When connecting to the server, the client can receive special instructions (rules) to assist in evaluating whether an update is relevant. These instructions are provided by a GetRules.asp page on a web server. These rules are presented in a scripting language, such as VBScript.FLEXnet Connect retrieves rules insecurely in that it uses unsigned and unencrypted communication using the HTTP protocol, which can allow an attacker to inject code that will be executed on the client system. This can happen in a number of ways, including  1. Compromising the FLEXnet Connect servers directly. 2. Filtering client system traffic through a malicious proxy. 3. Compromising DNS servers or otherwise modifying the host name lookup methodology of a client system.  Depending on how the vendor has configured the FLEXnet Connect components, the check for updates may occur on a periodic basis, every time an application is launched, when a user checks for updates manually, or if a web page that uses the FLEXnet ActiveX control is visited. Any software that has been packaged with the vulnerable InstallShield, Macrovision, or Acresso components may be vulnerable. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By modifying the rule script that is sent to a FLEXnet Connect client, a remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed with the FLEXnet Connect 11.0.1 client, which comes with agent.exe version 11.1.100.17104. This version of FLEXnet Connect includes the ability to verify certificates that are provided by the FLEXnet Connect server. A FLEXnet Connect server that uses signed communication will add an X-FNC-Sig HTTP header to outgoing messages. This signature is designed to prevent the server response from being successfully modified by an attacker. The signature checking is also designed to ensure that the FLEXnet Connect client is connecting to an authentic FLEXnet Connect server, much in the same way that HTTPS helps to ensure the identity of a web site. Note that the originally-released version of the FLEXnet Connect 11.0.1 client, which came with agent.exe version 11.1.100.16604, did not completely address this vulnerability.Note that the FLEXnet Connect 11.0.1 SDK does not enable secure communications by default, but the updates.installshield.com FLEXnet Connect server is currently distributing an update that enables this feature. This means that if a system's DNS has been hijacked or if the communications with the FLEXnet Connect update server are modified before this update can be retrieved, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the client system.Because the fixed version of the FLEXnet Connect runtime is relatively new (it was digitally signed on September 26, 2008), it is likely to take some time before software that is packaged with FLEXnet Connect will receive the update and also configure FLEXnet Connect to verify signatures. For this reason, we recommend the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Block outbound requests that contain the string** ***/GetRules.asp***It may be possible to prevent this vulnerability from being exploited by filtering outbound URLs that contain the string */GetRules.asp*. Some filtering examples are below. *These examples may not work in all cases, and may cause unintended side-effects.*     + iptables: iptables -A OUTPUT -m string --algo bm --string "/GetRules.asp" -j REJECT + Squid: acl blockthisURL url\_regex /GetRules.asphttp\_access deny blockthisURL + Snort: alert tcp any any <> any 80 (msg:"GetURL\_rule"; sid:12346789; uricontent:"/GetRules.asp"; nocase;)  **Disable the DWUpdateService ActiveX control in Internet Explorer**The vulnerable ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs:  {551E5190-19C7-4626-9D54-FB20355E6467}{5B7524C8-2446-40E9-9474-94A779DBA224}{8D9BB053-FEE5-4411-B6F5-F1E37DDC3106}{EE4E49B0-38EC-4C23-A7A6-2E190B5E3418}{FFF2D28F-E4EE-44D9-8104-8E71556757F6} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control:  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{551E5190-19C7-4626-9D54-FB20355E6467}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{5B7524C8-2446-40E9-9474-94A779DBA224}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{8D9BB053-FEE5-4411-B6F5-F1E37DDC3106}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{EE4E49B0-38EC-4C23-A7A6-2E190B5E3418}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{FFF2D28F-E4EE-44D9-8104-8E71556757F6}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400 Note that this list of CLSIDs may not be complete. Different versions of FLEXnet Connect or InstallShield Update Service use different CLSIDs for the ActiveX control that can be used to trigger updates.**Restrict access to the FLEXnet Conect client components**The vulnerable update components can be disabled by restricting access to the ISSCH.EXE and ISUSPM.EXE components on Microsoft Windows Systems. These executable files are for the InstallShield Update Service Scheduler and the Macrovision FLEXnet Connect Update Manager, respectively. These programs are used to periodically check for software updates using FLEXnet Connect. Users may also wish to rename the "\Program Files\Common Files\InstallShield\UpdateService" or related UpdateManager folders of other products to prevent automated execution of these programs until a fix is provided. Note that this may interfere with a product's ability to retrieve updates, including security fixes.**Disable ActiveX**Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities.

### [Acresso Software](#MAPG-7JLKR7) Affected

Notified:  September 18, 2008  Updated: September 30, 2008

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The vulnerability that you refer to has been corrected in more recent versions of the product.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

This issue is addressed with the FLEXnet Connect 11.0.1 client, which comes with agent.exe version 11.1.100.17104. This version of FLEXnet Connect includes the ability to verify certificates that are provided by the FLEXnet Connect server. A FLEXnet Connect server that uses signed communication will add an X-FNC-Sig HTTP header to outgoing messages. This signature is designed to prevent the server response from being successfully modified by an attacker. The signature checking is also designed to ensure that the FLEXnet Connect client is connecting to an authentic FLEXnet Connect server, much in the same way that HTTPS helps to ensure the identity of a web site. Note that the originally-released version of the FLEXnet Connect 11.0.1 client, which came with agent.exe version 11.1.100.16604, did not completely address this vulnerability.

Note that the FLEXnet Connect 11.0.1 SDK does not enable secure communications by default, but the updates.installshield.com FLEXnet Connect server is currently distributing an update that enables this feature. This means that if a system's DNS has been hijacked or if the communications with the FLEXnet Connect update server are modified before this update can be retrieved, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the client system.

Because the fixed version of the FLEXnet Connect runtime is relatively new (it was digitally signed on September 26, 2008), it is likely to take some time before software that is packaged with FLEXnet Connect will receive the update and also configure FLEXnet Connect to verify signatures.

SUMMARY
InstallShield Update Agent - Remote "Rule Script" Code Execution Vulnerability.
OVERVIEW
InstallShield Update Agent uses insecure methods of retrieving operational
script code from unauthenticated, unverified external sources over HTTP.
Arbitrary remote code execution is possible on all known product versions.
DESCRIPTION
InstallShield Update Agent connects to and communicates with centralized
Acresso (formerly Macrovision) FLEXnet Connect servers for updates and other
product information on a periodic basis. From the vendor's site:
FLEXnet Connect lets you electronically deliver applications, patches,
updates, and messages directly to your users' systems.
When connecting with this service, the client agent reports its product GUID,
current version information and finds out what updates for relevant installed
software are available. The client can also receive special instructions
(Rules) to help it evaluate if an update is relevant. These rules are in the
form of an active scripting language, such as VBScript. Unfortunately, these
rules are delivered insecurely, over HTTP, both unencrypted and unsigned as
they are blissfully executed by the client.
Exploitation by injecting code into these rules can result in completely
arbitrary execution on the client side, and could thusly perform any action
such as installing or downloading additional malicious code and instructions
from an arbitrary source. This execution could potentially happen completely
transparently and go unnoticed by users.
Such exploitation could take place by a number of mechanisms. For example:
a) Compromising the FLEXnet Connect servers directly.
b) Filtering client system traffic through malicious proxy.
d) Utilizing DNS insecurities to cause any of the above.
e) Also, by directing clients to malicious website, ActiveX objects can be
used to trigger the exploit on the attacker's schedule, (but MiTM
mechanisms may still be needed to support this).
(Note this list is by no means exhaustive.)
Due to the purpose of these products, it has been observed that systems will
check for updates unattended and thus could be compromised without any
intervention needed on the client side. Systems often check for these updates
on reboot (autorun) and on configurable periodic basis. Note that updates DO
NOT need to be installed to provoke this issue. This flaw takes effect when
the system is evaluating if updates are relevant.
It has also been observed that the recent versions of the InstallShield will
contact the server, download and execute this "Rule information" even if you
have disabled all automatic updates for your installed products. Presumably
this is part of the "compulsory updates" feature of the product. This
obviously is cause for additional concern.
Some vendor products may also include methods that call the update mechanisms
internally. This may happen at program startup or through the "Check for
Updates" link often provided in the Help menu of such applications.
Note also, that in addition to the above flaw. There also appear to be flaws
in the implementation and use of these services. It has also been noted that
vendors largely appear to ignore the apparent signature capabilities of the
product to provide cryptographic signatures for the actual executable update
files that are downloaded and executed -- largely over HTTP. This implies
additional paths of code execution using the MiTM techniques mentioned. These
paths have not been explored in depth, but appear to exist due to the lack of
signature information in updates. The update information itself is not
signed, so it is not clear what trust chains are used to verify this
information if it was provided. This problem of course is not isolated to
this product, but many online update mechanisms in general.
IMPACT
Any client system using products that have update mechanisms built on the
InstallShield/FLEXnet Connect product line are vulnerable. This includes many
Microsoft Windows systems that often ship with software pre-installed by the
OEM. For example, some popular CD burning software appears to use the IS
update services pointed at their own servers and is a very widely-deployed
application.
Any vendor or provider hosting the FLEXNet update services should also be
concerned of this issue. As a result of this flaw, the security of their
servers is critical as it could impact the of all client systems, and thus
represents a liability to any customers dependant on their services.
Due to the broad reach of these products, there are many software vendors that
must be informed of this issue and provide some form of remediation to protect
their installed customer base from these issues. Unfortunately it was
impossible to know everyone who uses this product at the time of this release.
It is assumed that the vendor has/will taken the actions they deem appropriate
to notify its customer base.
SOLUTION
No vendor provided solution is known at this time. The vendor largely
discounts the issue, implying that it may be difficult to exploit and that
following best practices to secure the server systems would prevent this from
being exploited. They have provided a brief document
to this effect, unfortunately they also tagged it as confidential and I cannot
release it. The vendor said they will release it when this information is
published.
With the addition of the Kaminsky attack, this is just another reason why you
must be sure your DNS is update to date, and be proactive as new protection
mechanisms come out for DNS.
WORKAROUND
Unfortunately, there is no good workaround to prevent this issue while still
allowing critical updates for other products dependant on this platform for
distribution.
Enterprises that have proxy capabilities could disable access to the
GetRules.asp URLs that are used to download the script instructions, however
this may have consequences to programs that depend on the rules for
determining patch applicability.
The only way to be comfortable that you fully prevent the risk of this issue
for users that are concerned with the security of their systems is to disable
this automatic update program for the time being. For InstallShield, this
includes removing any Autorun entries for ISSCH.EXE, ISUSPM.EXE, and possibly
setting the Kill bit for any related ActiveX controls (isusweb.dll), that
remain enabled (See references for one patch related to this -- it is not
clear to me they covered all GUIDs with these patches). Some users may wish
to rename the "\Program Files\Common Files\InstallShield\UpdateService" or
related UpdateManager folders of other products to prevent automated execution
of these programs until a fix is provided.
Unfortunately this workaround is clearly a catch-22 as other critical updates
to products that depend on these services may now be overlooked as well. Use
this information at your own risk. Absolutely no warrantees expressed or
implied!

procedures by Brian Dowling of Simplicity Communications.
HISTORY
This time-line is mostly here to keep track of work and progress on this
issue. However it does highlight one important thing. Vendors need to
provide valid, secure, contact information that can get security issues
reported to the proper individuals within their organization. This contact
information should be clearly published on their public facing web sites.
12/05/2007 - Initial Discovery
12/12/2007 - Contacted Cert Coordination Center to attempt to obtain
appropriate vendor contact information.
12/17/2007 - Additional work on details, proof of concept
interim - No response from Macrovision either directly or through Cert (who
kept in constant contact with me).
01/02/2008 - Posted to product request site for security contact information.
01/08/2008 - Automated sales response, asking how "Product Evaluation" is
going.
01/18/2008 - In contact with sales representative &#64; Macrovision
02/05/2008 - Attempted to contact Product Technical Support
02/06/2008 - Technical Support call back - forwarded me back to
"Product Coordinator" (local Sales Contact).
02/07/2008 - Contacted by Director of Product Management for Macrovision
02/08/2008 - Sent vendor vulnerability details
02/21/2008 - Resent information, vendor was unable to decrypt
03/03/2008 - Vendor responds "We are reviewing the materials and will provide
a public response shortly."
03/10/2008 - Inquired if they have been able to reproduce. Similar response
to above, "..public response in the coming days"
03/21/2008 - Inquired, was told they were crafting a public response.
04/01/2008 - Product vendor splits off software business, InstallShield now
owned by Acresso Software.
04/24/2008 - Vendor provided "Acresso's official response" which they do not
appear to have yet published publicly, and I feel I cannot due to
the following legal tagging:
"This document contains proprietary trade secrets of Acresso
Software Inc. Receipt or possession does not convey any right to
reproduce, disclose its content, or to manufacture, use, or sell
anything that it may describe. Reproduction, disclosure or use
without specific authorization of Acresso Software is strictly
forbidden."
07/01/2008 - Given the lack of further vendor response and the duration that I
had known about this vulnerability, I was starting to prepare to
release.
07/08/2008 - Critical Kaminsky DNS Vulnerability came to light, re-ignited my
concern over release of this information.
09/03/2008 - Contacted vendor again, requesting URL for their public response,
informed them of my intent to publicly disclose.
09/05/2008 - I was told that vendor will publish their response when my
findings are published.
09/16/2008 - Public disclosure.
