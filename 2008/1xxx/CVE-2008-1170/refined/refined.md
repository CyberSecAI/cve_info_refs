Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1170:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a remote file inclusion vulnerability in kcwiki 1.0. This means the application is vulnerable to including external files in its execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a remote file inclusion (RFI) flaw. The application fails to sanitize or validate the `page` parameter in the URL, allowing an attacker to specify a remote file to be included.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file. This could lead to:
*   Full system compromise.
*   Data theft or manipulation.
*   Denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests where a malicious URL is provided in the `page` parameter. The provided example URLs show how an attacker can specify a remote file using the `page` parameter in the `wiki.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability, so the attacker can be unauthenticated and remote.

**Summary:**
CVE-2008-1170 details a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in kcwiki 1.0, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by including malicious files via the `page` parameter in `wiki.php` URLs. This could result in full system compromise.
