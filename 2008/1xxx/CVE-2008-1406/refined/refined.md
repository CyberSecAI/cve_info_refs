```
- Root cause of vulnerability: SQL injection vulnerability exists in the 'lid' parameter of the annonces-p-f.php script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can potentially access sensitive information, modify or delete data from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries. In this case, the provided exploit shows how to retrieve usernames and passwords from the exv2_users table.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited through the 'lid' parameter in the URL, specifically via the 'modules/MyAnnonces/annonces-p-f.php' script.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, specifically modifying the 'lid' parameter in the URL. No specific user privileges or local access are required, making it remotely exploitable.
