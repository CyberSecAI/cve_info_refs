Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The coreutils package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.6 had an incorrect configuration in the `/etc/pam.d/su` file. Specifically, the `pam_succeed_if.so` module was not used correctly due to a missing space around the `=` in `uid=0`, which caused the module to treat "uid=0" as an unknown option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect PAM Configuration:** The incorrect syntax in the PAM configuration file for the `su` command (`/etc/pam.d/su`) caused the `pam_succeed_if` module to fail and default to success in all account checks.
*   **Bypass of Account Restrictions:** The incorrect PAM configuration allowed any local user to use the `su` command to switch to locked, disabled, or expired user accounts, provided they knew the target account's password. This bypasses the intended security restrictions for non-root users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A local user with knowledge of another user's password could gain access to a locked, disabled, or expired account.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not a direct privilege escalation to root, this vulnerability allows a user to access an account that they should not have access to, potentially gaining access to restricted data or functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have a valid local user account on the affected system.
*   **`su` Command:** The vulnerability is exploited using the `su` command.
*   **Password Knowledge:** The attacker must know the password of the target (locked, expired, or disabled) user account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   **Password Knowledge:** The attacker must know the password of the target account.
*   **Basic Command Line Access:** The attacker needs to be able to use the `su` command.

**Additional details:**

*   The issue was a regression introduced while fixing a previous bug.
*   The vulnerability existed only in coreutils-5.2.1-31.7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.6.
*   The fix involves correcting the PAM configuration file to use the `pam_succeed_if` module correctly by adding spaces around the `=`.
*   The fix was released as part of the RHSA-2008:0780 security advisory.
