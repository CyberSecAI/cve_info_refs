Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1971:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure cookie handling in PhShoutBox. The application improperly relies on the presence of a cookie to grant administrative access, rather than verifying the user's credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application does not properly validate the administrator status using a password or other secure methods. Instead, it relies on the presence of a specific cookie (`phadmin` or `ssbadmin`).
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Because the presence of a cookie directly grants admin access, an attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Authentication/Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized administrative access to the PhShoutBox by crafting and setting the specific cookie. This allows the attacker to modify the shoutbox configuration and perform other administrative tasks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Cookie:** An attacker crafts a malicious cookie with the key `phadmin` (for version 1.5) or `ssbadmin` (for versions < 1.4) and a value of "True".
*   **Client-Side Injection:** The attacker uses JavaScript to set this cookie in the user's browser while they are on the vulnerable site.
*   **Accessing Admin Panel:** The attacker then navigates to the admin panel (`admin.php` for 1.5 or `shoutadmin.php` for older versions) which is now accessible without valid credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to set a cookie in the browser while browsing the vulnerable site.
*   The attacker needs to know the name of the cookie used for authentication in the respective versions of PhShoutBox.
*   The attacker needs to know the location of the admin login panel.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit is client-side and easy to execute using Javascript within the browser.
*   The vulnerability affects PhShoutBox version 1.5 and earlier.
*   The vendor was not notified at the time of the vulnerability publication.
