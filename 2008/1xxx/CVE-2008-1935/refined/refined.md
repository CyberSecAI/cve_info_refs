Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1935:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `idFiliale` parameter of the Joomla! Component Filiale version 1.0.4. This occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `idFiliale` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and directly query the database. Specifically, the provided exploit shows how an attacker could retrieve usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table.
*   **Data Manipulation:** While the provided exploit focuses on reading data, SQL injection vulnerabilities can also be used to modify or delete data.
*   **Potential Full System Compromise:**  Depending on database privileges, SQL injection could lead to more significant damage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file with the vulnerable `com_filiale` component. The `idFiliale` parameter is the specific target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! instance, making this a remote vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Component:**  The attacker needs to know the correct component name (`com_filiale`) and the vulnerable parameter (`idFiliale`).

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit provided in the content uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract sensitive data.
*   The exploit is specific to Joomla! installations with the vulnerable Filiale component.
*   The exploit details the vulnerable version, 1.0.4, and provides a DORK to find vulnerable sites.

In summary, CVE-2008-1935 describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Joomla! Filiale component. An attacker can use it to extract usernames and password, as well as perform other malicious queries against the database.
