  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-1545",
      "source": "www.mindedsecurity.com_a3ed4427_20250125_130920.html",
      "root_cause": "Internet Explorer 7 allows setting the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header via `setRequestHeader`, which can be used to perform HTTP request splitting/smuggling attacks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The ability to set `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` via JavaScript in IE7 allows a malicious actor to craft a request containing a second, smuggled request.",
        "The web server will interpret the first part of the request as chunked data, even if a `Content-Length` is also specified, as per RFC 2616."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can perform HTTP request splitting/smuggling attacks, potentially leading to:\n  - Stealing HTTP headers (including HttpOnly cookies and Authorization data) from requests to the victim server.\n  - Performing local cache poisoning by injecting a poisoned page with an `Expire:` header.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker leverages a site vulnerable to reflected XSS on the same host as the attacker's site, without the user having a proxy configured. The attacker crafts a malicious script using `XMLHttpRequest` to send a POST request with `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header, embedding a second, smuggled HTTP request within the chunked data. When the browser reuses the open socket to send further requests to the victim server, the smuggled request is sent to the attacker's server, effectively hijacking the connection for their malicious purposes.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a website and find an XSS vulnerability in a website on the same host as their target website. They also need the user to use IE7 without a proxy."
