{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a variable \"CarpPath\" in `files/carprss.php` and `files/amazon-bestsellers.php` without proper definition or sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include malicious code from a remote server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request with the \"CarpPath\" variable set to a malicious URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, and needs to have a publicly accessible server hosting malicious PHP code."
