Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a remote file inclusion (RFI) flaw in the `footer.php` file of Quinsonnas Mail Checker version 1.55. The application improperly handles user-supplied input, specifically the `op[footer_body]` parameter, allowing an attacker to include remote files.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization, which leads to a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability. The application doesn't validate the URL provided to the `op[footer_body]` parameter, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP file from a remote location. This could lead to complete server compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a web request targeting the `footer.php` file. The attacker includes a malicious PHP file via the `op[footer_body]` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have a web server hosting the malicious PHP file. No authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content gives a proof of concept (POC) which shows how to exploit the vulnerability, by appending `?op[footer_body]=http://localhost/020.txt?` to the `footer.php` path.
