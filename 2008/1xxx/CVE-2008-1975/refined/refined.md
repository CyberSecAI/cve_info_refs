Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1975:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `index.php` file of the E RESERV version 2.1 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (`ID_loc` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Compromise:** An attacker can use the SQL injection vulnerability to potentially extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even gain control over the database server. The provided example payload allows the attacker to determine the version of the database being used.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing any prior authentication or access to the application. They simply need to send a crafted URL to the server hosting the application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit URL is: `http://[Site]/[script]/index.php?ID_loc=[sql]`
*   Example exploit: `http://[Site]/[script]/index.php?ID_loc=-1 union select version()--`
*   The vulnerable parameter is `ID_loc` in the `index.php` script.
*   The SQL injection vulnerability allows arbitrary SQL statements to be executed.
