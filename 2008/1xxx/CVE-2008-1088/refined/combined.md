## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why is this update Critical for Project 2000 but only Important for all other affected versions of Project?**

Microsoft Project 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.

**I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2. Are any additional security features included in this update?**

Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2003, when users of Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. All updates released after January 1, 2008 for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 will include these security features, which were introduced in [Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=e25b7049-3e13-433b-b9d2-5e3c1132f206&displaylang;=en). We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951646](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/951646).

**Where are the file information details?**

The file information details can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 950183](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/950183).

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Project constitute a flaw in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**What is included in the Microsoft Project update that causes the higher version of the update files?**

The update files include changes to support stability changes in Microsoft Project and additional changes to support corporate environment changes requested by customers. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems.

### Vulnerability Information

## Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers

| Affected Software | Project Memory Validation Vulnerability CVE-2008-1088 | Aggregate Severity Rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Project 2000 Service Release 1 | **Critical**\ Remote Code Execution | **Critical** |
| Microsoft Project 2002 Service Pack 1 | **Important**\ Remote Code Execution | **Important** |
| Microsoft Project 2003 Service Pack 2 | **Important**\ Remote Code Execution | **Important** |

## Project Memory Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1088

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Project handles specially crafted Project files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a malformed file which could be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a specially crafted or compromised Web site.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-1088](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1088).

#### Mitigating Factors for Project Memory Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1088

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and later editions of Office.

#### Workarounds for Project Memory Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1088

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ for Project Memory Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1088

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Project does not properly validate memory resource allocations when opening Project files.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open a malformed Project file with an affected version of Microsoft Project.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a malformed Project file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Project is used are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

#### Office Features

The following table contains the list of feature names (case sensitive) that must be reinstalled for the update. To install all features, you can use **REINSTALL=ALL** or you can install the following features:

| Product | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| Project 2002 | ProductFiles |

**Note** Administrators working in managed environments can find complete resources for deploying Office updates in an organization at the Office Admin Update Center. At that site, scroll down and look under the **Update Resources** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides more information about the parameters supported by Windows Installer.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.

This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.

To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:

* [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en)
* [Windows Installer 2.0 Redistributable for Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33338)
* [Windows Installer 2.0 Redistributable for Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, and Windows Millennium Edition](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33337)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/q** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/q:u** | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user. |
| **/q:a** | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user. |
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files. |
| **/c** | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |
| **/r:n** | Never restarts the system after installation. |
| **/r:I** | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**. |
| **/r:a** | Always restarts the system after installation. |
| **/r:s** | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user. |
| **/n:v** | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Removing the Update**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office XP CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

## Microsoft Office Project vulnerable to remote code execution via specially crafted Project file

#### Vulnerability Note VU#155563

Original Release Date: 2008-04-08 | Last Revised: 2008-04-29

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way Microsoft Office Project parses files may lead to execution of arbitrary code.

### Description

| Microsoft Office Project contains a vulnerability that could be exploited when Project attempts to parse specially crafted files. According to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS08-018](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS08-018.mspx), "Microsoft Project does not properly validate memory resource allocations when opening Project files." |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected user or cause a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**  Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS08-018](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS08-018.mspx) for more details. |
| --- |

| **Do not open untrusted Microsoft Office documents**  Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Microsoft Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip [ST04-010](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-010.html).**Disable automatic opening of Microsoft Office documents**By default, Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Office 2000 will configure Internet Explorer to automatically open Microsoft Office documents. This feature can be disabled by using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=8B5762D2-077F-4031-9EE6-C9538E9F2A2F&displaylang=en). Mozilla Firefox users should disable automatic opening of files by following the instructions in the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#ffdownloadactions) document.**Do not rely on file name extension filtering**In most cases, Windows will call a Microsoft Office application to open a document, even if the document has an unknown file extension. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .ppt, .xls, and .doc) will not detect all Microsoft Office documents. Additionally, a Microsoft Office file with no file extension will also open with a Microsoft Office application. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
