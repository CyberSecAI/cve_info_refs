  "CVE-2008-1088": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Microsoft Project does not properly validate memory resource allocations when opening Project files.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Project handles specially crafted Project files. The vulnerability is triggered when the application fails to properly validate memory resource allocations when opening Project files.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.",
      "Attack vectors": "Attack vectors include: sending a malformed Project file as an email attachment or hosting a malicious file on a specially crafted or compromised website.  User interaction is required to open the malicious file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malformed Project file and convince the user to open it. This can be done through social engineering or by compromising a website."
    },
    {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper validation of memory resource allocations when opening Project files.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote code execution vulnerability due to insufficient memory validation when parsing specially crafted files.",
         "Impact of exploitation":"Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user opening the malicious file, potentially leading to complete system compromise if the user has administrative rights or denial of service.",
        "Attack vectors": "Malicious Project files can be delivered via email attachments or hosted on a website.",
         "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious Project file and convince the user to open it."
