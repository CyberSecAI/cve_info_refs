Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1081:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Opera's improper handling of image comments. Specifically, the browser incorrectly treats image comments as scripts and executes them within an unintended security context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Handling of Image Comments:** The primary weakness is the browser's failure to sanitize or properly contextualize image comments, leading to their interpretation as executable code.
- **Incorrect Security Context:** Executing scripts within the wrong security context bypasses intended security boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially leading to:
    - Cookie theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of web pages
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user
- **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability could allow for execution of code in an elevated security context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Image Comments:** Attackers would need to inject malicious script into the comment section of an image and then get a victim to load a page containing the image using the vulnerable browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote as they can send a crafted webpage to the victim, or they can inject the crafted image to a page the victim frequents.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- **Discovered By:** Max Leonov is credited with discovering this vulnerability.
- **Affected Versions:** Opera versions prior to 9.26 are affected.
- **Resolution:** Upgrading to Opera 9.26 or later resolves this issue.
- **Gentoo Linux Advisory:** Gentoo also released an advisory (GLSA 200803-09) about the issue.
- **SUSE Linux Advisory:** SUSE also released an advisory (SUSE-SA:2008:011) about the issue.
