Title: CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops Server and CA
Desktop Management Suite Multiple Vulnerabilities
CA Advisory Date: 2008-04-03
Reported By: Dyon Balding of Secunia Research
Impact: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code or cause a
denial of service condition.
Summary: CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops Server
contains multiple vulnerabilities that can allow a remote attacker
to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition.
CA has issued updates to address the vulnerabilities. The first
issue, CVE-2008-1328, occurs due to insufficient bounds checking
on command arguments by the LGServer service. The second issue,
CVE-2008-1329, occurs due to insufficient verification of file
uploads by the NetBackup service. In most cases, an attacker can
potentially gain complete control of an affected installation.
Additionally, only a server installation of BrightStor ARCserve
Backup for Laptops and Desktops is affected. The client
installation is not affected.
Note: the previously published patches for CVE-2007-3216 and
CVE-2007-5005 did not fully address some issues.
Mitigating Factors: Client installations are not affected.
Severity: CA has given these vulnerabilities a maximum risk rating
of High.
Affected Products:
CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops r11.5
CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops r11.1 SP2
CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops r11.1 SP1
CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops r11.1
CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops r11.0
CA Desktop Management Suite 11.2 English
CA Desktop Management Suite 11.2 localized
CA Desktop Management Suite 11.1
Affected Platforms:
Windows
Status and Recommendation:
CA has provided updates to address the vulnerabilities.
CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops 11.1, 11.1 SP1, 11.2
SP2: QO95512
CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops 11.5: QO95513
CA Desktop Management Suite 11.2 English: QO95513
CA Desktop Management Suite 11.2 localized: QO95513
CA Desktop Management Suite 11.1: Upgrade to 11.1 C1.
CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops 11.0: Upgrade to
ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops version 11.1 and apply
the latest patches. QI85497
How to determine if you are affected:
For Windows:
1. Using Windows Explorer, locate the file "rxRPC.dll". The
file can be found in the following default locations:
Product: CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops 11.5
Directory Path: C:\Program Files\CA\BrightStor ARCserve Backup
for Laptops & Desktops\Explorer
Product: CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops 11.1
Directory Path: C:\Program Files\CA\BrightStor ARCserve Backup
for Laptops & Desktops\server
Product: CA Desktop Management Suite 11.2 English
Directory Path: C:\Program Files\CA\DSM\BABLD\MGUI
Product: CA Desktop Management Suite 11.2 localized
Directory Path: C:\Program Files\CA\DSM\BABLD\MGUI
2. Right click on the files and select Properties.
3. Select the General tab.
4. If the file date is earlier than indicated in the below
table, the installation is vulnerable.
