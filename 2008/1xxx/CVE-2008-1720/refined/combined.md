How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Wayne Davison](/search?l=rsync-announce@lists.samba.org&q=from:%22Wayne+Davison%22)
[Tue, 08 Apr 2008 10:02:45 -0700](/search?l=rsync-announce@lists.samba.org&q=date:20080408)

```
I have released rsync 3.0.2.  This is a security release to fix a
potential buffer overflow in the extended attribute support.  For
more details, see the rsync security advisory page:
```
```

  <http://rsync.samba.org/security.html>

There is a patch there that can be applied to 2.6.9 (if you were using
the xattrs.patch), 3.0.0, or 3.0.1.

Those running a writable rsync daemon can opt to refuse the "xattrs"
option in their daemon config to avoid the problem without an upgrade.

I would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer for bringing this bug to my
attention.

To see the brief summary of the changes since 3.0.1, visit this link:

| [Description](#c0)  Scott A. Friedman    2002-04-27 17:54:43 UTC  ``` The driver compiles but has a problem reading the net adapter's eeprom. The  last version 0.85 in the previous 2.4.19-r1 worked fine and has forced me to  drop to using vanilla-sources (0.85) until this is resolved. I am using a 3com  based board.  I am going to check with the driver authors at  <http://jes.home.cern.ch/jes/gige/acenic.html> to see what they know. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Seemant Kulleen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-05-03 20:09:41 UTC  ``` Did you hear back from them? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-05-04 18:59:03 UTC  ``` Hiya... what's the status update on checking with the authors? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Scott A. Friedman    2002-05-04 23:56:37 UTC  ``` Nada - maybe they are on vacation ;-)  I'll try again - and take a look at what's changed as well.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Scott A. Friedman    2002-05-15 20:45:28 UTC  ``` I have looked at this somewhat and perfomed a little testing.  linux-2.4.18 w/acenic 0.85 works linux-2.4.19-gentoo-r5 w/acenic 0.89 (same kernel settings) DOES NOT WORK linux-2.4.19-gentoo-r5 w/acenic 0.85 (same kernel settings) DOES NOT WORK  There is nothing obvious in the code that would point to something. However,  the above test indicate to me that there is some issue related to 2.4.19 and  the acenic driver (at least with my machine and card) without any of the  gentoo performance patches turned on.  The machine I am running on is a Abit BP6 dual Celeron with 3Com gigabit and  Intel eepro100 cards.  The Intel cards works fine always. When the 3Com card  has a problem it's limited to reading the card's eprom to retrieve it's MAC  address. That is the extent of the problem as far as I can tell. There is no  change between 0.85 and 0.89 versions of the driver in the eprom read code.  Maybe one of you guys can get the driver author to look at it.  I am including a copy of dmesg when the driver fails to read the card's eprom.  Scott  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Scott A. Friedman    2002-05-15 20:47:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1009](attachment.cgi?id=1009 "dmesg output showing acenic eeprom sync/read failure") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=1009&action=edit "dmesg output showing acenic eeprom sync/read failure")] dmesg output showing acenic eeprom sync/read failure ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Scott A. Friedman    2002-05-16 15:04:40 UTC  ``` Finally got ahold of the driver author. He is looking into this problem.   ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Brandon Low (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-09-06 17:29:28 UTC  ``` Have you tested this in gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r9, if not please do and report the status of it. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Brandon Low (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-10-01 08:06:41 UTC  ``` Assuming fixed unless you re-open this bug. ``` |  |

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- rsync heap overflow in xattr code
A remotely exploitable heap overflow in rsync's xattr code has
been fixed. CVE-2008-1720 has been assigned to this issue.
rsync was fixed on openSUSE 10.3.
- MozillaFirefox 2.0.0.14 security release
Mozilla Firefox was brought to security update version 2.0.0.14.
Following security problems were fixed:
- MFSA 2008-20/CVE-2008-1380: Fixes for security problems in the
JavaScript engine described in MFSA 2008-15 (CVE-2008-1237) introduced
a stability problem, where some users experienced frequent crashes
during JavaScript garbage collection. These crashes may be exploitable
if someone finds a reliable way to trigger the crash.
We were not able to reproduce the crashes internally. Updates have been
released on SLE 10, SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- poppler PDF problems
Specially crafted PDF files with embedded fonts could potentially be
abused to trick applications that process PDF files into executing
arbitrary code (CVE-2008-1693).
Fixes for poppler for all distributions containing poppler have
been released.
- nagios cross site scripting problems
Several cross site scripting (XSS) issues in nagios were fixed
(CVE-2007-5624, CVE-2007-5803, CVE-2008-1360).
SLE 10, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 received fixed nagios packages.
- lighttpd SSL denial of service
The web server lighttpd had a problem, where an error in one
SSL connection could lead to termination of all SSL connections
(CVE-2008-1531)
This problem has been fixed in SLE 10, SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE
10.2 and 10.3.
- sarg various buffer overflows
Multiple stack buffer overflows have been fixed in the Squid logfile
analyzer sarg. (CVE-2008-1922)
sarg updates have been released for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2
and 10.3.
- squid denial of service fix
A flaw in a previous security update could cause squid to crash
under certain circumstances (CVE-2008-1612).
squid was updated on all distributions.
- bzip2 decoder denial of service
Specially crafted files could crash the bzip2-decoder
(CVE-2008-1372).
bzip2 was updated on all distributions.
- kdelibs3 unix signal handling
Start\_kdeinit did not handle unix signals the right way
(CVE-2008-1671)
This was only a problem in openSUSE 10.3 and fixed there.
- texlive-bin dvips overflows
Buffer overflows in dvips and dviljk could be triggered by specially
crafted dvi files (CVE-2007-5935, CVE-2007-5937). dvips additionally
created temporary files in an insecure manner (CVE-2007-5936).
Only openSUSE 10.3 updates were missing for this issue, the others
were released several weeks ago already.
- kdelibs4 heap overflow in PNG loader of KHTML
A heap overflow in the PNG loader of KHTML has been
fixed. CVE-2008-1670 has been assigned to this issue.
Only openSUSE 10.3 was affected and fixed.
- Sun Java 1.6.0 u6 security update
Sun Java was updated to 1.6.0u6 to fix several bugs and potentially
also security problems.
Sun has however not published any details regarding Security
Vulnerabilities in this update.
Only openSUSE 10.3 contains Sun Java 1.6.0 and was fixed.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# rsync: Execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200804-16**

A buffer overflow in rsync might lead to the remote execution of arbitrary
code when extended attributes are being used.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/rsync** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.6.9-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.6.9-r6** |

### Background

rsync is a file transfer program to keep remote directories
synchronized.

### Description

Sebastian Krahmer of SUSE reported an integer overflow in the
expand\_item\_list() function in the file util.c which might lead to a
heap-based buffer overflow when extended attribute (xattr) support is
enabled.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a file containing specially crafted
extended attributes to an rsync deamon, or entice a user to sync from
an rsync server containing specially crafted files, possibly leading to
the execution of arbitrary code.

Please note that extended attributes are only enabled when USE="acl" is
enabled, which is the default setting.

### Workaround

Disable extended attributes in the rsync daemon by setting "*refuse
options = xattrs*" in the file "/etc/rsyncd.conf" (or append
"xattrs" to an existing "refuse" statement). When synchronizing to a
server, do not provide the "-X" parameter to rsync. You can also
disable the "acl" USE flag for rsync and recompile the package.

### Resolution

All rsync users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/rsync-2.6.9-r6"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
