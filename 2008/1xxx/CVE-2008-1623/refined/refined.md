Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `admin_view_image.php` script of Smoothflash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the `cid` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords. This is demonstrated in the provided exploit which retrieves username and password hashes from the `lwsp_users` table.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful exploitation could lead to further attacks, including complete database compromise and potential takeover of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted GET request to the `admin_view_image.php` script, specifically by manipulating the `cid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand basic SQL injection techniques to craft a suitable malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit example provided in the content is `admin_view_image.php?cid=-99999/**/union/**/select/**/concat(username,0x3a,password)/**/from/**/lwsp_users`
*   The exploit uses `UNION SELECT` to extract the `username` and `password` fields.
*   The identified vulnerable application is called Smoothflash, created by Newartonline.
