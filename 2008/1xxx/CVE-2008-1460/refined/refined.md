Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-1460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability present in the `joovideo` component for Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`id` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach/Exposure:** By injecting malicious SQL, an attacker can potentially read sensitive data, including usernames and passwords stored in the `jos_users` table.
*   **Complete System Compromise (Potentially):** Depending on the database permissions, a successful SQL injection could allow an attacker to modify, delete, or create data, potentially leading to complete control over the affected web application and/or underlying database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL using HTTP GET request. Specifically, the vulnerable parameter is `id`. The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application; no prior access is needed.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft the malicious injection.
*   **Knowledge of Joomla! and the vulnerable component:** The attacker needs to know that the target site is running Joomla with the vulnerable `joovideo` component.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract sensitive information from the `jos_users` table (which is the default user table in Joomla!).
*   The injected SQL attempts to retrieve the `username` and `password` fields.

**Exploit URL Example:**

```
index.php?option=com_joovideo&Itemid=S@BUN&task=detail&id=-99999/**/union/**/select/**/0,0,0x3a,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,concat(username,0x3a,password)/**/from/**/jos_users/*
```
