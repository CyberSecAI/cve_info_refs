# Evolution: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200806-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Evolution may allow for user-assisted execution
of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/evolution** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.12.3-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.12.3-r2** |

### Background

Evolution is the mail client of the GNOME desktop environment.

### Description

Alin Rad Pop (Secunia Research) reported two vulnerabilities in
Evolution:

* A boundary error exists when parsing overly long timezone strings
  contained within iCalendar attachments and when the ITip formatter is
  disabled (CVE-2008-1108).
* A boundary error exists when replying to an iCalendar request with an
  overly long "DESCRIPTION" property while in calendar view
  (CVE-2008-1109).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
iCalendar attachment, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Evolution.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Evolution users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/evolution-2.12.3-r2"
```
### References

* [CVE-2008-1108](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1108)
* [CVE-2008-1109](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1109)

**Release date**

June 16, 2008

**Latest revision**

June 16, 2008: 01

**Severity**

normal

**Exploitable**

remote

**Bugzilla entries**

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Multiple buffer overflows have been fixed in Evolution.
CVE-2008-1108: A buffer overflow in Evolution, when the ITip
Formatter plugin is disabled, allows remote attackers potentially
to execute arbitrary code via a long timezone string in an iCalendar
attachment.
CVE-2008-1109: A heap-based buffer overflow in Evolution allows
user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long
DESCRIPTION property in an iCalendar attachment, which is not properly
handled during a reply in the calendar view (aka the Calendars window).
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of evolution after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

provided that the advisory is not modified in any way. In particular, the
clear text signature should show proof of the authenticity of the text.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research discovered that Evolution did not

properly validate timezone data when processing iCalendar attachments.

If a user disabled the ITip Formatter plugin and viewed a crafted

iCalendar attachment, an attacker could cause a denial of service or

possibly execute code with user privileges. Note that the ITip

Formatter plugin is enabled by default in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2008-1108](/security/CVE-2008-1108))

Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research discovered that Evolution did not

properly validate the DESCRIPTION field when processing iCalendar

attachments. If a user were tricked into accepting a crafted

iCalendar attachment and replied to it from the calendar window, an

attacker code cause a denial of service or execute code with user

privileges. ([CVE-2008-1109](/security/CVE-2008-1109))

Matej Cepl discovered that Evolution did not properly validate date

fields when processing iCalendar attachments. If a user disabled the

ITip Formatter plugin and viewed a crafted iCalendar attachment, an

attacker could cause a denial of service. Note that the ITip

Formatter plugin is enabled by default in Ubuntu.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Changelog

```
evolution (2.6.1-0ubuntu7.4) dapper-security; urgency=low

  * SECURITY UPDATE: buffer overflow via timezone data in crafted ical
    attachments
  * debian/patches/99_01_CVE-2008-1108.patch: adjust
    calendar/gui/e-itip-control.c to use a GString rather than a fixed-size
    buffer to build the HTML string to avoid the possibility of an overflow.
  * SECURITY UPDATE: heap-based overflow via crafted ical attachments with
    long DESCRIPTION
  * debian/patches/99_02_CVE-2008-1109.patch: adjust calendar/gui/itip-utils.c
    to not use a fixed-size buffer for parsing external data. Simplify the
    logic to just split and rejoin the string with a different line separator.
  * SECURITY UPDATE: remotely triggered denial of service
  * debian/patches/99_03_bug535459.patch: add sanity checks and don't use
    component when checks fail in plugins/itip-formatter.c, gui/itip-utils.h,
