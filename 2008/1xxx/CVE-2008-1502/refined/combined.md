How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# eGroupWare: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200805-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities in eGroupWare may lead to execution of arbitrary
PHP code, the ability to upload malicious files and cross-site scripting
attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/egroupware** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.004** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.004** |

### Background

eGroupWare is a suite of web-based group applications including
calendar, address book, messenger and email.

### Description

A vulnerability has been reported in FCKEditor due to the way that file
uploads are handled in the file
editor/filemanager/upload/php/upload.php when a filename has multiple
file extensions (CVE-2008-2041). Another vulnerability exists in the
\_bad\_protocol\_once() function in the file
phpgwapi/inc/class.kses.inc.php, which allows remote attackers to
bypass HTML filtering (CVE-2008-1502).

### Impact

The first vulnerability can be exploited to upload malicious files and
execute arbitrary PHP code provided that a directory is writable by the
webserver. The second vulnerability can be exploited by remote
attackers via a specially crafted URL in order to conduct cross-site
scripting attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All eGroupWare users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/egroupware-1.4.004"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- moodle cross site scripting problem
An incorrect input validation in moodle could be exploited by
attackers to conduct cross site scripting attacks (CVE-2008-1502).
moodle is contained in and was fixed for openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- clamav 0.93.3 release
The Opensource AV scanner clamav was brought to version 0.93.3.
The changelog lists CVE-2008-2713 as fixed, which was fixed in
0.93.1 already, and had minor additional fixes to it in 0.93.3.
The update contains otherwise just stability and bugfixes.
clamav was updated on all distributions containing clamav.
- zypper repository signature checking and addition
The zypp-refresh-patches wrapper in used by various online updater
applets in openSUSE to check for new updates accepted new repository
keys without asking the user, so parsing potentially corrupted repositories.
It did not import those keys into the trusted keyring, leaving only the
repository XML parsing endangered. Please note that this wrapper only
checks repositories, it does not do any package operations.
This issue was assigned Mitre CVE ID CVE-2008-3187.
Only zypper in openSUSE 10.2, 10.3 and 11.0 were affected by this
problem and fixed.
- mercurial input validation
mercurial on openSUSE 11.0 was improved regarding input validation.
Prior to this patch it was possible to touch files as root.
(CVE-2008-2942)
- poppler code execution problem
Poppler was updated to fixes a potential code execution
bug. (CVE-2008-2950)
Only openSUSE 11.0 was affected by this problem and received fixed
packages.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Moodle, an online
course management system. The following issues are addressed in this
update, ranging from cross site scripting to remote code execution.

Various cross site scripting issues in the Moodle codebase
(CVE-2008-3326, CVE-2008-3325, CVE-2007-3555, CVE-2008-5432,
MSA-08-0021, MDL-8849, MDL-12793, MDL-11414, MDL-14806,
MDL-10276).

Various cross site request forgery issues in the Moodle codebase
(CVE-2008-3325, MSA-08-0023).

Privilege escalation bugs in the Moodle codebase (MSA-08-0001, MDL-7755).

SQL injection issue in the hotpot module (MSA-08-0010).

An embedded copy of Smarty had several vulnerabilities
(CVE-2008-4811, CVE-2008-4810).
An embedded copy of Snoopy was vulnerable to cross site scripting
(CVE-2008-4796).
An embedded copy of Kses was vulnerable to cross site scripting
(CVE-2008-1502).

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.3-2+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.2.dfsg-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your moodle (1.6.3-2+etch1) package.
