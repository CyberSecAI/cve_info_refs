## Microsoft Jet Engine stack buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#936529

Original Release Date: 2008-03-22 | Last Revised: 2008-05-13

---

### Overview

The Microsoft Jet Engine contains a stack buffer overflow, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Jet, or Joint Engine Technology, is a database engine that is used by several Microsoft products, including Access and Visual Basic. A Microsoft Access database uses the .MDB file extension by default. The Microsoft Jet Engine contains a stack buffer overflow in the handling of specially crafted database files.  Microsoft Word can link to Jet databases. In some cases, the database can be opened without prompting the user. This can allow Microsoft Word documents to be used as an attack vector for this vulnerability. Microsoft Outlook can also be used as an attack vector by either opening a specially crafted email message or by viewing such a message in the preview pane. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to open a specially crafted Word document or Jet database, such as a Microsoft Access .MDB file, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS08-028](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/ms08-028.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Block MDB files from being processed through your mail infrastructure**  To detect Jet files that have possibly been renamed to another file type, search for files with any of the following 15-byte signatures at location 0x4 (no quotes):"Jet System DB  ""Standard Jet DB""Temp Jet DB    ""MSISAM Database"**Configure Microsoft Outlook to view and edit email messages in plain text**According to Microsoft, this can be accomplished in the following ways:**Manual (User Interaction)**Enterprise Users follow these steps to disable the Outlook feature to use Word as mail editor:   1. Restart the machine. 2. Open Outlook 3. Click Tools, click Options, and then click the Mail Format tab. 4. Clear the Use Microsoft Word to edit e-mail messages check box. 5. Clear the Use Microsoft Word to read Rich Text e-mail messages box. 6. Exit Outlook. 7. Restart the machine.  **Impact of Workaround:** Users will not be able to use Word as their e-mail editor or use Rich Text to read their e-mail**Using Group Policy**Domain administrators can use Group Policy to disable Word as the users e-mail editor. You do not have to restart the computer to implement this mitigation.For information on using registry keys with a Group Policy see Using Administrative Template Files with Registry-Based Group Policy and Distributing Registry Changes.**Disable WordMail in Word 2003**  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Outlook\Options\Mail]"EditorPreference"=dword:00020000"UseWordMail"=dword:00000000 **Disable WordMail in Word 2002**  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\10.0\Outlook\Options\Mail]"EditorPreference"=dword:00020000"UseWordMail"=dword:00000000 **Impact of Workaround:** Users will not be able to use Word as their e-mail editor or use Rich Text by default to read their e-mail.**Restrict the Microsoft Jet Database Engine from running**To implement the workaround, enter the following command at a command prompt:echo y| cacls "%SystemRoot%\system32\msjet40.dll" /E /P everyone:N |

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**CVE-2005-0944 also describes a vulnerability in Microsoft Jet Engine. How does CVE-2005-0944 relate to this update?**

The vulnerability referenced by CVE-2005-0944 has also been addressed by this update. The vulnerability details for CVE-2005-0944, including affected and non-affected software, mitigating factors, and workarounds remain the same as for CVE-2007-6026. To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2005-0944](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-0944).

**Why is this update rated Critical?**

While .mdb is on the unsafe file type list, there are attack scenarios that would bypass the mitigations provided for unsafe file-types. Specifically, customers with Microsoft Office could be at risk to e-mail or direct download attack scenarios. For example, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a Word file with a specially crafted .mdb file embedded in it to the user and convincing the user to open the document or view the e-mail containing the specially crafted file. In the case of Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2007, the attack could be executed by viewing the document in HTML in the Outlook 2003 or Outlook 2007 preview pane. We recommend these customers apply this update immediately.

**Does this update protect against attacks via other applications?**

Yes. There are applications that can be installed that can be used as an attack vector for this vulnerability. For example, a Jet database file can be opened from a Word document, from e-mail, or by visiting a malicious website. Applying this update will block those attacks. However, it is recommended that customers also apply the updates provided in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-026: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word Could Allow Remote Code Execution (951207)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=117295) to fully block newly discovered attack vectors.

## Microsoft Jet Engine MDB File Parsing Stack Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2007-6026

A buffer overrun vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Jet Database Engine (Jet) that could allow remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted database query and sending it through an application that is using Jet on an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-6026](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-6026).

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Jet Engine MDB File Parsing Stack Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2007-6026

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a specially crafted Word file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's site.
* Systems that use Microsoft Outlook 2003 and 2007 as their e-mail client can mitigate the HTML email vector for Outlook 2007 by configuring mail to be read in plain text only.
* Systems running all supported editions of Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 are not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Jet Engine MDB File Parsing Stack Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2007-6026

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Restrict the Microsoft Jet Database Engine from running for any application**

  To implement the workaround, enter the following command at a command prompt:

  `echo y| cacls "%SystemRoot%\system32\msjet40.dll" /E /P everyone:N`

  **Impact of workaround.** Any application requiring the use of the Microsoft Jet Database Engine to make data access calls will not function.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Enter the following command at a command prompt

  `echo y| cacls "%SystemRoot%\system32\msjet40.dll" /E /R everyone`
* **Use group policy to restrict the Microsoft Jet Database Engine from running for any application**

  To implement the workaround, perform the following steps:

  1. Create the following script, named JetCacls.cmd for illustration:

     @echo off

     if exist %systemdrive%\Cacls.log goto end

     cacls "%SystemRoot%\system32\msjet40.dll" /E /P everyone:N > nul 2>&1

     echo %date% %time%: Msjet Cacls updated > %systemdrive%\Cacls.log

     :end

     exit
  2. Copy JetCacls.cmd to the Netlogon shared folder, or another shared folder on the domain controller from which JetCacls.cmd would run.
  3. Set up JetCacls.cmd. In the **Active Directory Users and Computers MMC** snap-in, right-click the domain name, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Group Policy** tab.
  5. Click **New** to create a new Group Policy object (GPO), and enter JetCacls for the name of the policy.
  6. Click the new policy, and then click **Edit**.
  7. Expand **Windows Settings for Computer Configuration**, and then click **Scripts**.
  8. Double-click **Logon**, and then click **Add**. The Add a Script dialog box appears.
  9. Type \\s*ervername*\s*harename*\JetCacls.cmd in the Script Name box.
  10. Click **OK**, and then click **Apply**.
  11. Then restart the client computers that are members of this domain.

  **Impact of workaround.** Any application that requires the use of the Microsoft Jet Database Engine to make data access calls will not function. This restriction only applies to applications that are running on client computers in the domain.
* **Block MDB files from being processed through your mail infrastructure**

  **Note** All Jet database files should be treated as unsafe file types for common users and Microsoft recommends that database files transferred via e-mail be treated as suspicious.

  To implement this workaround, your mail environment must support the ability to search for attachments containing a specific file structure (not just the file extension) within an e-mail message and then perform actions on the attachment such as delete, quarantine, notify, and report the detected file.

  To detect Jet files that have possibly been renamed to another file type, search for files with any of the following 15-byte signatures at location 0x4 (no quotes):

  ```
  "Jet System DB "
  "Standard Jet DB"
  "Temp Jet DB "

  ```

  For configurations specific to Microsoft Exchange customers using Forefront (formerly Antigen) technologies, please see [Microsoft Forefront Server Security: File Filtering](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb795068.aspx) for more information.

  This information has been shared with members of [Microsoft Security Response Alliance](https://www.microsoft.com/security/msra/default.mspx). To utilize the MSRA tools to detect MDB files, please contact the providers as listed on the MSRA home page.

  **Impact of Workaround.** Files detected by this configuration will be blocked from processing through an organizationâs e-mail system.
* Configure Outlook 2007 to read mail in plain text.
* Do not open or save Jet or Microsoft Word files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Jet Engine MDB File Parsing Stack Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2007-6026

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. A remote, anonymous attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the local user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Microsoft Jet Database Engine (Jet) does not perform sufficient validation of a data structure. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted database query and sending it through an application that is using Jet on an affected system.

**What is the Microsoft Jet Database Engine (Jet)?**

The Microsoft Jet Database Engine provides data access to applications such as Microsoft Access, Microsoft Visual Basic, and many third party applications. Jet can also be used by Internet applications that require database functionality.

**Arenât .mdb files on the unsafe file type list? If so, why is this a Critical vulnerability?**

While .mdb is on the unsafe file type list, a new attack vector has been discovered where a Jet database file can be opened from a Word document. This update will block current attacks as well as provide additional fixes for the Jet Database Engine. However, it is recommended that customers also apply the updates provided in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-026: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word Could Allow Remote Code Execution (951207)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=117295) to block the newly discovered attack vector.

**Should .mdb files still be considered unsafe?**

Yes. While this update blocks active attacks, .mdb database files perform unsafe functions by design. Customers should still treat these files with caution. Furthermore, supported Microsoft e-mail applications will continue to block .mdb files from being opened.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to open a specially crafted database file using Jet. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a Word file with a specially crafted .mdb file embedded in it to the user and by convincing the user to open the document or view the email containing the specially crafted file. Or in the case of Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2007, the attack could be executed by viewing the document in HTML in the Outlook 2003 or Outlook 2007 preview pane.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Jet file or a Word file with a specially crafted Jet file embedded in it to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.

**Is there anything that helps mitigate the risk of an HTML email attack?**

Systems using Microsoft Outlook as their e-mail client can mitigate the HTML email vector for Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2007 by configuring mail to be read in plain text only.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where a vulnerable version of the Microsoft Jet 4.0 Database Engine is installed on supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP Service Pack 2, and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 are primarily at risk. These operating systems, also listed in the Affected Software table in the **General Information** section, are delivered with the vulnerable version of Jet. Therefore, you may review the next FAQ on how to determine the vulnerable version of Jet on your system.

**How do I know if I have a vulnerable version of Jet?**

If the version of Msjet40.dll is lower than 4.0.9505.0, you have a vulnerable version of Jet on your system. Version 4.0.9505.0 and all higher versions of Msjet40.dll are not vulnerable to this buffer overrun.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by improving the validation of data structures within Jet.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed and has been commonly referred to as âMicrosoft Jet Engine MDB File Parsing Stack Overflow Vulnerabilityâ and assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE 2007-6026](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-6026).

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all editions)
