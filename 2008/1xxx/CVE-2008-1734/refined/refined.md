Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1734:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `php-select` script within the `app-admin/php-toolkit` package. Specifically, the script fails to properly quote parameters passed to the `tr` command. This allows for the modification of the `APACHE2_OPTS` variable within the `/etc/conf.d/apache2` configuration file in an unintended way.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper Input Handling:** The `php-select` script does not properly sanitize or quote arguments before passing them to the `tr` command.
-   **Command Injection:** While not a direct command injection, the lack of quoting allows for unintended manipulation of arguments within a command that modifies Apache's configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **PHP Source Code Disclosure:** By modifying `APACHE2_OPTS` to use lowercase "-D php5" instead of "-D PHP5", the Apache webserver will fail to interpret PHP files as code, causing the raw source code to be sent to the client.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The same misconfiguration will prevent Apache from loading the `mod_php` module resulting in a denial of service for websites relying on PHP.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user who can influence the working directory from where the emerge command or `php-select` script is run.
-   **Indirect Exploitation:** A user could be tricked into running `emerge php` or `php-select apache2 php5` from a directory containing a single-character, lowercase filename (e.g., a file named 'a'). This triggers the `tr` command to mangle the `-D PHP5` argument leading to the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local User:** An attacker needs to be a user on the system capable of running `emerge` or `php-select`.
-   **File Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create a file with a single lowercase character name in the directory where emerge or php-select is executed.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability arises due to insufficient input sanitization within the `php-select` script of the `app-admin/php-toolkit` package. This allows for manipulation of Apache configuration, leading to potential PHP source code disclosure and denial of service when a user runs the script or the `emerge` command from a directory containing a single lowercase character filename.
The fix was to properly quote arguments to `tr` to avoid this issue. The vulnerability is considered to be a security configuration issue because it results in an exploitable situation where normally a server would be secure, and a fix involved creating a new version of the package where the distfiles were relocated to allow for easier patching of the script without breaking stable versions.
