    {
      "root_cause": "The Perforce server is affected by multiple vulnerabilities which allow any unauthenticated attacker to crash the server or consume all its resources.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereferences due to missing parameters in client requests and lack of checks on pointers returned by functions retrieving these values.",
        "Integer overflow when initializing an array using a 32-bit number provided by the client.",
         "Endless loop vulnerability in `server-DiffFile` command due to malformed input."

      "impact": "Server crash, resource exhaustion, and denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending crafted requests without specific parameters leading to NULL pointer dereferences.",
        "Sending a large 32-bit integer via the server-DiffFile or server-ReleaseFile commands to cause an integer overflow during array allocation.",
        "Sending malformed server-DiffFile commands leading to an endless loop."
