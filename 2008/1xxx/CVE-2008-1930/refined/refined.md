Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2008-1930:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how WordPress 2.5 implemented cryptographic integrity protection for authentication cookies. Specifically, the username and expiry time were concatenated in the MAC calculation without any delimiters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cryptographic Splicing Attack:** The lack of delimiters in the MAC calculation allowed attackers to modify the cookie without invalidating the MAC, as long as the combined string of username and expiry time remained the same. This is also called a "cryptographic splicing attack".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could create a specially crafted username (e.g., starting with "admin") to generate a cookie. This cookie could then be manipulated to be valid for the administrator account or other chosen accounts.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By gaining administrator access, an attacker could escalate to arbitrary PHP code execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Account Registration:** The attacker needs to be able to register an account on the affected WordPress instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to register a new account on the WordPress blog.
-  The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific username.
- No other specific prior access is required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable cookie format is: `wordpress_[COOKIEHASH] = USERNAME | EXPIRY_TIME | MAC`
- `MAC` is calculated as: `HMAC-MD5(USERNAME . EXPIRY_TIME)` under a key derived from a secret and USERNAME . EXPIRY_TIME.
- The vulnerability is due to the concatenation of USERNAME and EXPIRY_TIME in the MAC calculation without delimiters, which makes the MAC susceptible to splicing attacks.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was responsibly reported by Steven Murdoch.
- WordPress 2.5.1 was released to fix this issue.
- A temporary workaround was to disable open registration on the WordPress site.
