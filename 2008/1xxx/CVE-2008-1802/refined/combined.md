How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# rdesktop: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200806-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities in rdesktop may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/rdesktop** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.0** |

### Background

rdesktop is an open source Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client.

### Description

An anonymous researcher reported multiple vulnerabilities in rdesktop
via iDefense Labs:

* An integer underflow error exists in
  the function iso\_recv\_msg() in the file iso.c which can be triggered
  via a specially crafted RDP request, causing a heap-based buffer
  overflow (CVE-2008-1801).
* An input validation error exists in
  the function process\_redirect\_pdu() in the file rdp.c which can be
  triggered via a specially crafted RDP redirect request, causing a
  BSS-based buffer overflow (CVE-2008-1802).
* An integer signedness error exists in the function xrealloc() in the
  file rdesktop.c which can be be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer
  overflow (CVE-2008-1803).

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by enticing a user to
connect to a malicious RDP server thereby allowing the attacker to
execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All rdesktop users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/rdesktop-1.6.0"

Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1801 CVE-2008-1802 CVE-2008-1803
Debian Bug     : 480133 480134 480135

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in rdesktop, a
Remote Desktop Protocol client. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-1801

    Remote exploitation of an integer underflow vulnerability allows
    attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
    logged-in user.

CVE-2008-1802

    Remote exploitation of a BSS overflow vulnerability allows
    attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
    logged-in user.

CVE-2008-1803

    Remote exploitation of an integer signedness vulnerability allows
    attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
    logged-in user.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.0-1etch2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.0-4+cvs20071006.

We recommend that you upgrade your rdesktop package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-646-1: rdesktop vulnerabilities

18 September 2008

rdesktop vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [rdesktop](/security/cves?package=rdesktop) -

## Details

It was discovered that rdesktop did not properly validate the length

of packet headers when processing RDP requests. If a user were tricked

into connecting to a malicious server, an attacker could cause a

denial of service or possible execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user. ([CVE-2008-1801](/security/CVE-2008-1801))

Multiple buffer overflows were discovered in rdesktop when processing

RDP redirect requests. If a user were tricked into connecting to a

malicious server, an attacker could cause a denial of service or

possible execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user.

([CVE-2008-1802](/security/CVE-2008-1802))

It was discovered that rdesktop performed a signed integer comparison

when reallocating dynamic buffers which could result in a heap-based

overflow. If a user were tricked into connecting to a malicious

server, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possible

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user.

([CVE-2008-1802](/security/CVE-2008-1802))

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
