```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not properly sanitize URLs received in the message window, allowing for the injection of shell commands.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Lack of input sanitization for special characters like "\'", "\"", ";", "$", "{", "}", "&&" and "||" in URLs received within the application's message window. This leads to command injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim's machine.
- Attack vectors: Sending a crafted URL via the message window of the CenterIM application.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to send a message containing the malicious URL to a user of the vulnerable CenterIM application.
