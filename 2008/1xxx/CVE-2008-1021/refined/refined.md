**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Apple QuickTime Player parses QuickTime files that use the Animation codec. Specifically, there is a lack of proper length checks when processing these files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  The absence of adequate length validation during the parsing of QuickTime files using the Animation codec can result in a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs when the application attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the currently logged-in user. This means an attacker can run malicious code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious QuickTime Files:**  Attackers can craft malicious QuickTime files that exploit this flaw.
- **Malicious Web Pages:** Attackers can also embed these malicious files on web pages, luring users to visit them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires user interaction.  Specifically, the target must either open a malicious QuickTime file or visit a webpage hosting such a file.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable file format:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious .mov file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- Apple has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific filter.
