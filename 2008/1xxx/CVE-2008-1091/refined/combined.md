# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-026 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word Could Allow Remote Code Execution (951207)

Published: May 13, 2008 | Updated: May 14, 2008

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Word file. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for supported editions of Microsoft Word 2000 and Microsoft Outlook 2007 and rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft Word 2002; Microsoft Word 2003; Microsoft Word Viewer 2003 and Microsoft Word Viewer 2003 Service Pack 3; Microsoft Word 2007; Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats; and Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac and Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

This security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Word handles specially crafted Word files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Note** This update includes additional security mitigations against public attacks using Microsoft Word to exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Jet Database Engine first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 950627](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/950627). In addition to installing this update, we recommend that customers install the update provided in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-028: Vulnerability in Microsoft Jet Database Engine Could Allow Remote Code Execution (950749)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=114750) for the most up to date protection against these types of attacks.

**Recommendation**. Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

**Known Issues.** None

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why is this update rated Critical for Outlook 2007?**

The update for Outlook 2007 is rated Critical because of the e-mail attack vector described in the FAQ section of the Object Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1091 in this bulletin. Outlook 2007 users should apply the update immediately to protect against attacks that attempt to leverage the preview pane to exploit this vulnerability.

**The Office component discussed in this article is part of the Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the version of the Office Suite installed on your system shipped with the component discussed in this bulletin, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that shipped with the particular Office Suite and offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is included in the version of the Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. However, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335).

**Where are the file information details?**

The file information details can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951207](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/951207).

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin, this update includes logic enhancements to security warnings that mitigate Word as an attack vector used to exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Jet Database Engine first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 950627](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/950627). Prior to this update, Word was vulnerable to attacks when opening a specially crafted Word document containing a malicious Jet database file. After applying this update, Word will prompt a user for confirmation before running SQL commands or queries when opening Word documents. In addition to installing this update, we highly recommend that customers install the update provided in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-028: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Jet Database Engine Could Allow Remote Code Execution (950749)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=114750) for the most up-to-date protection against these types of attacks.

**This is a Microsoft Word update. Why are Microsoft Outlook 2007 and Microsoft Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 referenced in the Affected Software table?**

The files that are updated to address the vulnerabilities documented in this bulletin are core files to Microsoft Word. For Microsoft Word 2007 and Microsoft Word 2007 Service Pack 1, some of these core files are shared with Microsoft Outlook 2007 and Microsoft Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1, and provide functionality, such as editing, to Outlook. Therefore, Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 need to be updated as well, and Word 2007 and Word 2007 Service Pack 1 and Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 are serviced by the same package.

Users with only Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 installed will still need to apply this Word update to their systems. Users with Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 that also have Word 2007 or Word 2007 Service Pack 1 installed will also need to apply this update but they will only need to install it once. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 949370](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/949370).

**I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2. Are any additional security features included in this update?**

Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2003, when users of Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. All updates released after January 1, 2008 for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 will include these security features, which were introduced in [Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=e25b7049-3e13-433b-b9d2-5e3c1132f206&displaylang;=en). We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951646](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/951646).

**Why is this update rated Critical for Word 2000 but only rated Important for all other affected versions of Word?**

Users who are running Word 2002 and later have a built-in feature that will prompt a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these software versions or editions, visit [Microsoft Product Support Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).

Customers who require custom support for older releases must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers.

The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted .rtf file with malformed strings in Word or previews a specially crafted .rtf file with malformed strings in rich text e-mail. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-1091](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1091).

#### Mitigating Factors for Object Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1091

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool for Office 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and later editions of Office.

#### Workarounds for Object Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1091

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality.

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations.**

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

  **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

## Microsoft Office fails to properly handle specially crafted Rich Text Format files

#### Vulnerability Note VU#543907

Original Release Date: 2008-05-13 | Last Revised: 2008-05-13

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way Microsoft Office handles Rich Text Format files may lead to execution of arbitrary code.

### Description

| Microsoft Office contains a vulnerability that could be exploited when parsing malformed strings contained in specially crafted Rich Text Format (.rtf) files. According to Microsoft Security Bulletin [ms08-026](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-026.mspx):   *The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted .rtf file with malformed strings in Word or previews a specially crafted .rtf file with malformed strings in rich text e-mail.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected user or cause a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. See Microsoft Security Bulletin ms08-026 for more details. |
| --- |

| **Do not open untrusted Microsoft Office documents**  Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Microsoft Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip [ST04-010](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-010.html).**Disable automatic opening of Microsoft Office documents**By default, Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Office 2000 will configure Internet Explorer to automatically open Microsoft Office documents. This feature can be disabled by using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=8B5762D2-077F-4031-9EE6-C9538E9F2A2F&displaylang=en). Mozilla Firefox users should disable automatic opening of files, as specified in the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#ffdownloadactions) document.**Do not rely on file name extension filtering**In most cases, Windows will call a Microsoft Office application to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .ppt, .xls, and .doc) will not detect all Microsoft Office documents. Additionally, a Microsoft Office file with no file extension will also open with a Microsoft Office application. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
