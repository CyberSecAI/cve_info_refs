Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1091:

**Summary:**

The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2008-1091, is a remote code execution flaw that exists in the way Microsoft Office handles specially crafted Rich Text Format (.rtf) files. This vulnerability can be exploited if a user opens a malicious .rtf file with malformed strings, either directly in Microsoft Word or by previewing it in a rich text email.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is due to a memory calculation error when processing a malformed string within a specially crafted .rtf file. This error can lead to memory corruption, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Specifically, it occurs during the parsing of RTF documents when processing a combination of RTF tags leading to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Heap Overflow:** A heap overflow vulnerability exists in how Microsoft Office parses RTF files, specifically involving malformed strings.
*   **Improper Memory Management:**  The vulnerability stems from incorrect memory allocation when processing the malformed strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Full System Control:** An attacker can gain complete control over the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new user accounts with full administrative privileges.
*  **Denial of Service:** Exploitation could also result in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Email:** An attacker can send a specially crafted .rtf file as an email attachment. If a user opens the attachment or previews the email (especially if using Word as the default editor for emails), the vulnerability can be triggered.
*   **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host malicious .rtf files on compromised websites or websites accepting user-provided content. Victims could be tricked into visiting these sites and opening the crafted files.
*   **File Opening:** Simply opening a specially crafted .rtf file through a vulnerable version of Microsoft Word or Office can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** Attackers can be remote and don't need any existing credentials on the target system.
*   **Social Engineering:**  For email or web-based attacks, the attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file or visit the malicious link. This often involves tricking the user through social engineering tactics, such as phishing.
*   **File Creation/Hosting:** Attackers must be able to create or obtain a specially crafted .rtf file and find a way to deliver it to the victim (email, website).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of malformed strings in RTF files.
*   Users with fewer privileges are less impacted but are still vulnerable.
*   Microsoft Word 2000 is rated as Critical due to the lack of a built in "Open, Save, Cancel" prompt, while Word 2002 and later are rated Important because of this built in prompt.
*   Microsoft strongly recommends installing the update immediately to mitigate the risk.
*   Workarounds are provided, including disabling automatic opening of Microsoft Office documents, using File Block policies in Microsoft Office and not opening unsolicited or untrusted files.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by filter ID 6099.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft by wushi of team509, working with Zero Day Initiative.
