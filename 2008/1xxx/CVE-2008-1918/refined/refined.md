    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `submit.php` file of PHP-Fusion. When submitting a link, the script serializes the input data into the database. However, user-controlled data is not properly sanitized before being serialized. By injecting a specially crafted parameter into the `submit_info` array, an attacker can inject SQL code into the query.",
