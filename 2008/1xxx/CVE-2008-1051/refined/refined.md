Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the `body_comm.inc.php` file of PHPProfiles 4.5.2 Beta. The `content` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include external files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**  The primary weakness is the ability to include remote files via the `content` parameter. This allows arbitrary code execution on the server.
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate and sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `content` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **System Access:** The most significant impact is the potential for complete system compromise by executing arbitrary PHP code injected through the included remote file.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request. The attacker crafts a URL targeting the vulnerable `body_comm.inc.php` file.
* **`content` Parameter:** The malicious payload is inserted into the `content` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
* **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs knowledge of the location of the vulnerable file, `body_comm.inc.php`.
* **Ability to Host Malicious File:** The attacker needs a server to host the malicious file that will be included on the vulnerable server.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit URL provided is:
```
http://localhost/path/Full_Release/include/body_comm.inc.php?content=[SHELL]
```
Here, `[SHELL]` represents the URL to a malicious PHP file hosted by the attacker. When the vulnerable script processes this URL, it fetches and executes the content of the malicious file, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

This exploit relies on the `register_globals` setting being enabled, as indicated in the notes.
