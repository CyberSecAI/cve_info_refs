# policykit or policykit-gnome do not work with passwords containing "%" character

### Bug Description

If you have a "%" character in your password you cannot unlock any application

/var/log/auth.log shows:

Mar 22 01:33:30 lorbas-laptop polkit-grant-helper-pam[7252]: pam\_unix(polkit:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=1000 euid=0 tty= ruser=lorbas rhost= user=lorbas

Mar 22 01:33:39 lorbas-laptop polkit-grant-helper-pam[7260]: pam\_unix(polkit:auth): conversation failed

Mar 22 01:33:39 lorbas-laptop polkit-grant-helper-pam[7260]: pam\_unix(polkit:auth): auth could not identify password for [lorbas]

I check "security vulnerability" because I think that the % character might trigger an evaluation of %s, like in sprintf for example

Hm, I tried to change my password to "foo%bar", and was able to authenticate with it. When I mistype the password, I get auth.log entries similar to your's.

So I cannot reproduce this bug. Can you please do

POLKIT\_DEBUG=1 users-admin 2>&1|tee /tmp/debug.log

then try to authenticate, and after that, send me /tmp/debug.log?

I can confirm this bug. For example a password like 'abcd%efgh' does not work. 'foo%bar' is working, so it seems to be a combination of '%' and some other condition I was not able to figure out.

debug.log is attached.

O.K. It really seems to be an interference with sprintf's conversion specifiers. 'foo%bar" is working because there is no '%b' specifier. 'foo%xbar', foo%ebar', 'foo%fbar', etc. are not working, because these are conversion specifiers.

This means it is almost certainly exploitable somehow.

If a user types a carefully crafted series of format strings, they can trick polkit-grant-helper into thinking the password was successful.

<https://launchpad.net/bugs/205037>

src/polkit-grant/polkit-grant-helper.c line 231:

/\* send to parent \*/

                fprintf (stdout, buf);

This should be fprintf(stdout, "%s", buf);

I also recommend adding "-Wformat -Wformat-security" to the gcc CFLAGS.

Hi,

Thanks for noticing this. I've committed this to HEAD

<http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=PolicyKit.git;a=commitdiff;h=5bc86a14cc0e356bcf8b5f861674f842869b1be7>

with one change: the hunk in src/polkit/polkit-policy-cache.c didn't apply and isn't needed anymore.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=152#c0)  freedesktop.org    2003-11-19 11:38:39 UTC  ``` I'm trying to run Xnest in xfree86. Not sure if this is a supported  configuration, but if it is, you might be interested in the following  backtrace. This is taken from right before it jumps to address 0:    #0  compCheckWindow (pWin=0x80d7b08, data=0x0) at compwindow.c:36          pScreen = 0x80cb8c8          pWinPixmap = 0x0          pParentPixmap = 0x80c1be8          pScreenPixmap = 0x3  #1  0x0806f24a in TraverseTree (pWin=0x80d7b08,      func=0x80a263c <compCheckWindow>, data=0x0) at window.c:223          result = 135101192          pChild = 0x80d7b08  #2  0x080a27b1 in compCheckTree (pScreen=0x80cb8c8) at compwindow.c:64  No locals.  #3  0x080a2dff in compCreateWindow (pWin=0x80d7b08) at compwindow.c:299          pScreen = 0x80cb8c8          cs = 0x80d2af0          ret = 1  #4  0x0806f745 in InitRootWindow (pWin=0x80d7b08) at window.c:512          pScreen = 0x80cb8c8  #5  0x0806913a in main (argc=2, argv=0xbffff874, envp=0xbffff880) at  main.c:423          i = 1          j = 135101192          k = 0          error = 134902491          xauthfile = 0x80d7b08 ""          alwaysCheckForInput = {0, 1}    Here's where it goes wrong:    #0  compCheckWindow (pWin=0x80d7b08, data=0x0) at compwindow.c:36  33      compCheckWindow (WindowPtr pWin, pointer data)  34      {  35          ScreenPtr   pScreen = pWin->drawable.pScreen;  36          PixmapPtr   pWinPixmap = (*pScreen->GetWindowPixmap) (pWin);  37          PixmapPtr   pParentPixmap = pWin->parent ?  (*pScreen->GetWindowPixmap) (pWin->parent) : 0;  38          PixmapPtr   pScreenPixmap = (*pScreen->GetScreenPixmap) (pScreen);    On line 36 here, pScreen->GetWindowPixmap is NULL.    Hope this is useful to you.    lilac ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=152#c1)  Chris Lee    2005-07-06 20:18:23 UTC  ``` This bug hasn't seen any activity, ever, and it claims to be about Xnest on  xfree86.  ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=152#c2)  freedesktop.org    2005-07-13 04:52:29 UTC  ``` It's about running Xnest from the xserver (kdrive or whatever it's called) tree  on an xfree86 server. This has nothing to do with x.org - I really don't know  why it was moved from product xserver to product xorg.  ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=152#c3)  Alan Coopersmith    2005-07-13 05:54:37 UTC  ``` A lot of bugs were misfiled under Xserver when they were really against the Xorg monolithic tree - this appeared to be one, which is why I moved it.   Since I was wrong, I'll move it back, but I don't know that anyone's maintaining Xnest in the Xserver tree. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=152#c4)  Adam Jackson    2005-10-03 18:15:44 UTC  ``` the xnest in keith's xserver module is unsupported.  the xnest in xorg won't have this problem anyway, since it's smart enough to not enable the Composite extension. ``` |  |
