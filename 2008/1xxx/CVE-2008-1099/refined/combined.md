How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in MoinMoin, a
Python clone of WikiWiki. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-2423

    A cross-site-scripting vulnerability has been discovered in
    attachment handling.

CVE-2007-2637

    Access control lists for calendars and includes were
    insufficiently enforced, which could lead to information
    disclosure.

CVE-2008-0780

    A cross-site-scripting vulnerability has been discovered in
    the login code.

CVE-2008-0781

    A cross-site-scripting vulnerability has been discovered in
    attachment handling.

CVE-2008-0782

    A directory traversal vulnerability in cookie handling could
    lead to local denial of service by overwriting files.

CVE-2008-1098

    Cross-site-scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
    the GUI editor formatter and the code to delete pages.

CVE-2008-1099

    The macro code validates access control lists insufficiently,
    which could lead to information disclosure.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.3-1.2etch1. This update also includes a bugfix wrt the
encoding of password reminder mails, which doesn't have security
implications.

The old stable distribution (sarge) will not be updated due to
the many changes and support for Sarge ending end of this month
anyway. You're advised to upgrade to the stable distribution if
you run moinmoin.

We recommend that you upgrade your moin package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 4.0 (stable)
- -------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

Source archives:

  <http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/m/moin/moin_1.5.3.orig.tar.gz>
    Size/MD5 checksum:  4187091 e95ec46ee8de9527a39793108de22f7d

    Size/MD5 checksum:      663 0650a6782cb8b11d99fbfa40378c1dfb

Architecture independent packages:

  <http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/m/moin/moinmoin-common_1.5.3-1.2etch1_all.deb>
    Size/MD5 checksum:  1596522 2cd40d664082f835b2def29629ff58e8

    Size/MD5 checksum:   915318 0a8dba5cff0e5540e4e55d39855316d4

### Background

MoinMoin is an advanced, easy to use and extensible Wiki Engine.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered:

* A vulnerability exists in the file wikimacro.py because the
  \_macro\_Getval function does not properly enforce ACLs
  (CVE-2008-1099).
* A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the userform action
  (CVE-2008-0782).
* A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability exists in the login action
  (CVE-2008-0780).
* Multiple Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities exist in the file
  action/AttachFile.py when using the message, pagename, and target
  filenames (CVE-2008-0781).
* Multiple Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities exist in
  formatter/text\_gedit.py (aka the gui editor formatter) which can be
  exploited via a page name or destination page name, which trigger an
  injection in the file PageEditor.py (CVE-2008-1098).

### Impact

These vulnerabilities can be exploited to allow remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML, overwrite arbitrary files, or read
protected pages.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MoinMoin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/moinmoin-1.6.1"
```
