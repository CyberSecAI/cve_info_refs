Core Security Technologies - CoreLabs Advisory
http://www.coresecurity.com/corelabs/
Orbit Downloader "Download failed" buffer overflow
\*Advisory Information\*
Title: Orbit Downloader "Download failed" buffer overflow
Advisory ID: CORE-2008-0314
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/?action=item&id=2211
Date published: 2008-04-03
Date of last update: 2008-04-03
Vendors contacted: Orbit Downloader team
Release mode: Coordinated release
\*Vulnerability Information\*
Class: Buffer overflow
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: 28541
CVE Name: CVE-2008-1602
\*Vulnerability Description\*
Orbit downloader [1] is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack, which
can be exploited by malicious remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code. The vulnerability is due to Orbit not properly converting an URL
ascii string to unicode. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code
by downloading a file from a specially crafted URL.
\*Vulnerable Packages\*
. Orbit downloader 2.6.3 and 2.6.4.
. Older versions could be vulnerables too, but they were not tested.
\*Non-vulnerable Packages\*
. Orbit downloader 2.6.5.
\*Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds\*
Update to Orbit downloader 2.6.5, available at
http://dl.orbitdownloader.com/dl/OrbitDownloaderSetup.exe, or visit the
vendor homepage at http://www.orbitdownloader.com.
\*Credits\*
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Diego Juarez from
Core Security Technologies.
\*Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code\*
When Orbit is unable to download a file, a balloon control is popped in
the notification area. This is the code that takes care of drawing text
to said control:
/-----------

- -----------/
According to MSDN [2], the Win32 API function
/-----------
int MultiByteToWideChar(
UINT CodePage,
DWORD dwFlags,
LPCSTR lpMultiByteStr,
int cbMultiByte,
LPWSTR lpWideCharStr,
int cchWideChar
);
- -----------/
has a parameter 'cchWideChar' which should be the "size, in WCHAR
values, of the buffer indicated by lpWideCharStr". By supplying a
download URL longer than 4096 bytes, if the download fails,
'MultiByteToWideChar' will overflow the 8192 bytes buffer in the stack
and write up to 0x2000 WCHARs (16384 bytes) to it, overwriting internal
structures and enabling arbitrary code execution.
