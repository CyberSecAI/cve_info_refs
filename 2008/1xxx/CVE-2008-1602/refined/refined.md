{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to Orbit Downloader not properly converting a URL ASCII string to Unicode, specifically within the MultiByteToWideChar function call.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow in the stack. The MultiByteToWideChar function copies data into a buffer on the stack which has a size of 8192 bytes, but if a specially crafted URL longer than 4096 bytes is used, the function can write up to 16384 bytes to it, overwriting internal structures.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution. Attackers can execute code of their choosing by overflowing the buffer in the stack during the failed download.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote. The vulnerability can be triggered by downloading a file from a specially crafted URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted malicious URL to the victim."
