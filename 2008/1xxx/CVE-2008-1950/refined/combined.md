| **Subject**: | GnuTLS 2.2.5 - Brown paper bag release |
| **Date**: | Mon, 19 May 2008 22:54:43 +0200 |

```
We are embarrassed to announce a new stable GnuTLS release: Version 2.2.5.

This release fixes a flaw in the patch for one of the security problems
fixed by version 2.2.4.  The updated advisory is included below.  As
always, further updates will be posted on:

<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>

I'd also like to take the opportunity to correct another mistake made
the announcement for v2.2.4: please send security analysis to
address@hidden and not to any other address.

GnuTLS is a modern C library that implement the standard network
security protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS), for use by network
applications.  GnuTLS is developed for GNU/Linux, but works on many
Unix-like systems and comes with a binary installer for Windows.

The core GnuTLS library is distribute under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public License version 2.1 (or later).  The "extra" GnuTLS
libraries -- which contains OpenPGP and TLS/IA support, LZO compression,
the OpenSSL compatibility library -- and the self tests and command line
tools are distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3.0
(or later).  The manual is distributed under the GNU Free Documentation
License version 1.2 (or later).

The project page of the library is available at:
  <http://www.gnutls.org/>
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/>
  <http://josefsson.org/gnutls/>

What's New
==========

* Version 2.2.5 (released 2008-05-19)

** Fix flaw in fix for GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-3.
The flaw would result in incorrectly terminated sessions with the
error "Decryption has failed" when the server sends a small packet
(typically when the session is closed).  Reported by Andreas Metzler
<address@hidden> in
<<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/2807>>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

Getting the Software
====================

GnuTLS may be downloaded from one of the mirror sites or direct from
<ftp://ftp.gnutls.org/pub/gnutls/>.  The list of mirrors can be found at
<<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/download.html>>.

Here are the BZIP2 compressed sources (4.8MB):

  ftp://ftp.gnutls.org/pub/gnutls/gnutls-2.2.5.tar.bz2
  <http://josefsson.org/gnutls/releases/gnutls-2.2.5.tar.bz2>

Here are OpenPGP detached signatures signed using key 0xB565716F:

  ftp://ftp.gnutls.org/pub/gnutls/gnutls-2.2.5.tar.bz2.sig
  <http://josefsson.org/gnutls/releases/gnutls-2.2.5.tar.bz2.sig>

Note, that we don't distribute gzip compressed tarballs.

In order to check that the version of GnuTLS which you are going to
install is an original and unmodified one, you should verify the OpenPGP
signature.  You can use the command

     gpg --verify gnutls-2.2.5.tar.bz2.sig

This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.  You
should see a message indicating that the signature is good and made by
that signing key.  Make sure that you have the right key, either by
checking the fingerprint of that key with other sources or by checking
that the key has been signed by a trustworthy other key.  The signing
key can be identified with the following information:

pub   1280R/B565716F 2002-05-05 [expires: 2008-06-30]
      Key fingerprint = 0424 D4EE 81A0 E3D1 19C6  F835 EDA2 1E94 B565 716F
uid                  Simon Josefsson <address@hidden>
uid                  Simon Josefsson <address@hidden>

The key is available from:
  <http://josefsson.org/key.txt>
  dns:b565716f.josefsson.org?TYPE=CERT

Alternatively, after successfully verifying the OpenPGP signature of
this announcement, you could verify that the files match the following
checksum values.  The values are for SHA-1 and SHA-224 respectively:

7620d092c790f0a5ac5486c3563786ca8777083d  gnutls-2.2.5.tar.bz2

d1cee353902a404a4b02fd0da981e8164c8b60356917abfc781b066c  gnutls-2.2.5.tar.bz2

Three security vulnerabilities in GnuTLS [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1]
- -----------------------------------------------------------

Released 2008-05-19 12:00:00 UTC.  Updated 2008-05-19 20:00.

Vulnerabilities were discovered by Ossi Herrala and Jukka Taimisto
from the CROSS project at Codenomicon Ltd., and reported directly to
the vendor through CERT-FI.  Problems reproduced and patches developed
by Simon Josefsson and Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.  Flaw in the initial
advisory reported by Andreas Metzler.

All updates with more details about these vulnerabilities will be
added to <<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>>.

libgnutls: Fix crash when sending invalid server name
- -----------------------------------------------------
[GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-1]

The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Denial of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
cause gnutls to store more session resumption data than what was
allocated for, thus overwriting unallocated memory.  The fix is to
patch ext_server_name.c as below.

libgnutls: Fix crash when sending repeated client hellos
- --------------------------------------------------------
[GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-2]

The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Denial of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
triggers a null-pointer dereference.  The fix is to patch
gnutls_handshake.c as below.

libgnutls: Fix crash in cipher padding decoding for invalid record lengths
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
[GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-3]

The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Denial of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
cause gnutls to read memory beyond the end of the received record.
The fix is to patch gnutls_cipher.c as below.

How to Apply the Patch
- ----------------------

This file has been verified to apply to the latest stable release of
the recent stable branches: version 1.4.5, 1.6.3, 2.0.4, and 2.2.3.
The patch will also work with version 1.2.11 but you will need to
apply it manually.  The patch also apply to the latest development
version 2.3.9 but keep in mind that this version is not intended for
production systems.  (The patch will not work for the broken releases
version 2.2.4 and 2.3.10 since they contained an incorrect patch.)

The patch was created with 'git-diff', so you will need to use '-p 1'
when invoking patch.  The following illustrate how you apply the patch
against version 1.6.3.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Actually, v2.2.4 did fix the security issue.

However, the code to detect and print a debug message about the attack
was buggy and was triggered for normal connections under some conditions
(conditions which, alas, the self-tests did not exercise).

Still, the 2.2.5 announcement is what you want to read to get the full
picture.  Note that gmane garbles OpenPGP signed cleartext patches.  Try
this link instead:

Based on discussion here:

<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2008-05/msg00055.html>

It seems like a regression.

Adding Simon to CC, so he may comment on this if he wants.

Maintainer, please bump. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  John Brooks    2008-05-20 00:01:39 UTC  ``` Should be dealt with quickly; there are three seperate remotely triggerable (prior to authentication) crash bugs fixed in this release, and at least two of them will affect almost any server application using GnuTLS. Should update to 2.2.5 rather than 2.2.4 - it fixes an issue introduced when fixing these vulnerabilities. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-05-20 02:18:23 UTC  ``` It is currently unclear whether these bugs could be exploited to execute arbitrary code, so until that is clear, we should handle it as A1.  dragonheart, since alonbl unfortunately is retiring, can you bump this package? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-05-20 11:53:27 UTC  ``` <https://www.cert.fi/haavoittuvuudet/advisory-gnutls.html> ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Daniel Black (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-05-20 13:41:34 UTC  ``` +gnutls-2.2.3.ebuild ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Daniel Black (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-05-20 14:12:38 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=222823#c5)) > +gnutls-2.2.3.ebuild >  er - +gnutls-2.2.5.ebuild :-)  ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-05-20 14:29:01 UTC  ``` Which should go stable, then? ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-05-20 14:37:04 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable: =net-libs/gnutls-2.2.5 Target keywords : "alpha amd64 arm hppa ia64 m68k ppc ppc64 release s390 sh sparc x86"  ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-05-20 15:20:13 UTC  ``` Might help to put a copy in distfiles-local quickly. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-05-20 15:35:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=222823#c9)) > Might help to put a copy in distfiles-local quickly.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

> Several issues have been announced in GNUTLS-SA-2008-1:

I've not been able to get hold of Steve Chrisey today to get names
allocated, but many of us have updates queued.  So I've allocated from
our CNA and will page Steve with the names to try to avoid any
duplicates when he returns.

> *** libgnutls: Fix crash when sending invalid server name.
> The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
> lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
> cause gnutls to store more session resumption data than what was
> allocated for, thus overwriting unallocated memory.

> *** libgnutls: Fix crash when sending repeated client hellos.
> The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Multiple security issues have been fixed in crypto framework gnutls:
CVE-2008-1948 (GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-1): The \_gnutls\_server\_name\_recv\_params
function in lib/ext\_server\_name.c in libgnutls in gnutls-serv in
GnuTLS before 2.2.4 does not properly calculate the number of Server
Names in a TLS 1.0 Client Hello message during extension handling,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code via a zero value for the length of
Server Names, which leads to a buffer overflow in session resumption
data in the pack\_security\_parameters function.
CVE-2008-1949 (GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-2): The \_gnutls\_recv\_client\_kx\_message
function in lib/gnutls\_kx.c in libgnutls in gnutls-serv in GnuTLS
before 2.2.4 continues to process Client Hello messages within a TLS
message after one has already been processed, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference and crash)
via a TLS message containing multiple Client Hello messages,
CVE-2008-1950 (GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-3): Integer signedness error in
the \_gnutls\_ciphertext2compressed function in lib/gnutls\_cipher.c in
libgnutls in GnuTLS before 2.2.4 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (buffer over-read and crash) via a certain integer
value in the Random field in an encrypted Client Hello message within
a TLS record with an invalid Record Length, which leads to an invalid
cipher padding length,
openSUSE 11.0 was already shipped with fixed gnutls packages.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of gnutls after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# GnuTLS: Execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200805-20**

Multiple vulnerabilities might allow for the execution of arbitrary code in
daemons using GnuTLS.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-libs/gnutls** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.5** |

### Background

GnuTLS is an implementation of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 3.0 and
Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.

### Description

Ossi Herrala and Jukka Taimisto of Codenomicon reported three
vulnerabilities in libgnutls of GnuTLS:

* "Client Hello" messages containing an invalid server name can lead to a
  buffer overflow when evaluating "Security Parameters" (CVE-2008-1948).
* Multiple "Client Hello" messages can lead to a NULL pointer dereference
  (CVE-2008-1949).
* A TLS handshake including an encrypted "Client Hello" message and an
  invalid record length could lead to a buffer overread (CVE-2008-1950).

### Impact

Unauthenticated remote attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to
cause Denial of Service conditions in daemons using GnuTLS. The first
vulnerability (CVE-2008-1948) might allow for the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the daemon handling incoming TLS
connections.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GnuTLS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/gnutls-2.2.5"
```

## GnuTLS Pad Length Denial of Service

#### Vulnerability Note VU#659209

Original Release Date: 2008-05-30 | Last Revised: 2008-05-30

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in GnuTLS that may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.

### Description

| GnuTLS contains a vulnerability in gnults-serv that may result in a denial of service when handling a sequence of specially crafted packets. According to [CERT-FI Vulnerability Advisory on GnuTLS](http://www.cert.fi/haavoittuvuudet/advisory-gnutls.html):  *We have found the flaw by doing complete TLS 1.0 handshake followed by a encrypted Client-Hello message to start abbreviated handshake. In this case the the Re**cord Length field of the TLS Record containing the Client Hello contains erroneus value '8' triggering the bug.* *Note that this might not be the only way to reproduce the bug.* Note that this issue may affect GnuTLS versions prior to 2.2.5 and also affects version 2.3.0. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthorized attacker may be able to cause a denial of service. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1581-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Florian Weimer

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : gnutls13
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1948, CVE-2008-1949, CVE-2008-1950

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in GNUTLS, an
implementation of the SSL/TLS protocol suite.

NOTE: The libgnutls13 package, which provides the GNUTLS library, does
not contain logic to automatically restart potentially affected
services.  You must restart affected services manually (mainly Exim,
using "/etc/init.d/exim4 restart") after applying the update, to make
the changes fully effective.  Alternatively, you can reboot the system.

The following vulnerabilities have been identified:

A pre-authentication heap overflow involving oversized session
resumption data may lead to arbitrary code execution (CVE-2008-1948).

Repeated client hellos may result in a pre-authentication denial of
service condition due to a null pointer dereference (CVE-2008-1949).

Decoding cipher padding with an invalid record length may cause GNUTLS
to read memory beyond the end of the received record, leading to a
pre-authentication denial of service condition (CVE-2008-1950).

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-3+etch1.  (Builds for the arm architecture are currently
not available and will be released later.)

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your GNUTLS packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

## GnuTLS 2.2.4 - Security release [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1]

---

| **From**: | Simon Josefsson |
| --- | --- |

| **Subject**: | GnuTLS 2.2.4 - Security release [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1] |
| **Date**: | Mon, 19 May 2008 14:00:43 +0200 |
| **User-agent**: | Gnus/5.110009 (No Gnus v0.9) Emacs/22.2 (gnu/linux) |

```
We are pleased to announce a new stable GnuTLS release: Version 2.2.4.

This release fixes three serious bugs that can crash the GnuTLS library.
We invite more detailed analysis of the problem, following our general
security advisory approach explained on:

<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>

Particularly, it would be useful to answer the question of whether these
bugs can be exploited remotely to execute arbitrary code.  It is
certainly possible to cause the server to crash.  We don't have
resources to investigate this problem more ourselves currently.

Please send your analysis to address@hidden and I'll update the
security advisory web page pointing to it.  Be sure to check the web
page first to get updates on what has been done so far.

Below is attached our own security advisory and patch.  The file has
been verified to apply to the latest stable release of the recent stable
branches: version 1.4.5, 1.6.3, 2.0.4, and 2.2.3.  The patch will also
work with version 1.2.11 but you will need to apply it manually.  The
patch also apply to the latest development version 2.3.9 but keep in
mind that this version is not intended for production systems.

GnuTLS is a modern C library that implement the standard network
security protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS), for use by network
applications.  GnuTLS is developed for GNU/Linux, but works on many
Unix-like systems and comes with a binary installer for Windows.

The core GnuTLS library is distribute under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public License version 2.1 (or later).  The "extra" GnuTLS
libraries -- which contains OpenPGP and TLS/IA support, LZO compression,
the OpenSSL compatibility library -- and the self tests and command line
tools are distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3.0
(or later).  The manual is distributed under the GNU Free Documentation
License version 1.2 (or later).

The project page of the library is available at:
  <http://www.gnutls.org/>

What's New
==========

* Version 2.2.4 (released 2008-05-19)

** Fix three security vulnerabilities.  [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1]
Thanks to CERT-FI for finding the bugs and providing detailed reports,
which allowed the bugs to be reproduced and fixed easily.  Patches
developed by Simon Josefsson and Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.  Any updates
with more details about these vulnerabilities will be added to
<<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>>

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-1]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash when sending invalid server name.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
cause gnutls to store more session resumption data than what was
allocated for, thus overwriting unallocated memory.

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-2]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash when sending repeated client hellos.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
triggers a null-pointer dereference.

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-3]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash in cipher padding decoding for invalid record lengths.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
cause gnutls to read memory beyond the end of the received record.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

Getting the Software
====================

GnuTLS may be downloaded from one of the mirror sites or direct from
<ftp://ftp.gnutls.org/pub/gnutls/>.  The list of mirrors can be found at
<<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/download.html>>.  Note, that GnuTLS
is not available at ftp.gnu.org.

Here are the BZIP2 compressed sources (4.8MB):

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnutls/gnutls-2.2.4.tar.bz2
  <http://josefsson.org/gnutls/releases/gnutls-2.2.4.tar.bz2>

Here are OpenPGP detached signatures signed using key 0xB565716F:

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnutls/gnutls-2.2.4.tar.bz2.sig
  <http://josefsson.org/gnutls/releases/gnutls-2.2.4.tar.bz2.sig>

Note, that we don't distribute gzip compressed tarballs.

In order to check that the version of GnuTLS which you are going to
install is an original and unmodified one, you should verify the OpenPGP
signature.  You can use the command

     gpg --verify gnutls-2.2.4.tar.bz2.sig

This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.  You
should see a message indicating that the signature is good and made by
that signing key.  Make sure that you have the right key, either by
checking the fingerprint of that key with other sources or by checking
that the key has been signed by a trustworthy other key.  The signing
key can be identified with the following information:

pub   1280R/B565716F 2002-05-05 [expires: 2008-06-30]
      Key fingerprint = 0424 D4EE 81A0 E3D1 19C6  F835 EDA2 1E94 B565 716F
uid                  Simon Josefsson <address@hidden>
uid                  Simon Josefsson <address@hidden>

The key is available from:
  <http://josefsson.org/key.txt>
  dns:b565716f.josefsson.org?TYPE=CERT

Alternatively, after successfully verifying the OpenPGP signature of
this announcement, you could verify that the files match the following
checksum values.  The values are for SHA-1 and SHA-224 respectively:

3b5d8138e3ce78b3a25f8d0491da438bb8ef6a4e  gnutls-2.2.4.tar.bz2

85b29eab286bb55d48d1454bfcf5bebba63581159c9dd0850a32a4c3  gnutls-2.2.4.tar.bz2

  <http://josefsson.org/gnutls4win/>

The Windows binary installer and OpenPGP signature:
  <http://josefsson.org/gnutls4win/gnutls-2.2.4.exe> (13MB)
  <http://josefsson.org/gnutls4win/gnutls-2.2.4.exe.sig>

A ZIP file with the installed tree of binaries:
  <http://josefsson.org/gnutls4win/gnutls-2.2.4.zip> (4.6MB)
  <http://josefsson.org/gnutls4win/gnutls-2.2.4.zip.sig>

The checksum values for SHA-1 and SHA-224 are:

Internationalization
====================

GnuTLS messages have been translated into Dutch, German, Malay, Polish
and Swedish.  We welcome the addition of more translations.

Support
=======

Improving GnuTLS is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find GnuTLS useful and wish to contribute back.  You
can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate money
or equipment.

Commercial support contracts for GnuTLS are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult, a Stockholm
based privately held company, is currently funding GnuTLS maintenance.
We are always looking for interesting development projects.  See
<http://josefsson.org/> for more details.

Hash: SHA1

Three security vulnerabilities in GnuTLS [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1]
- -----------------------------------------------------------

Released 2008-05-19 12:00:00 UTC.

Vulnerabilities were discovered by Ossi Herrala and Jukka Taimisto
from the CROSS project at Codenomicon Ltd., and reported directly to
the vendor through CERT-FI.  Problems reproduced and patches developed
by Simon Josefsson and Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.

All updates with more details about these vulnerabilities will be
added to <<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>>.

libgnutls: Fix crash when sending invalid server name
- -----------------------------------------------------
[GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-1]

The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
cause gnutls to store more session resumption data than what was
allocated for, thus overwriting unallocated memory.  The fix is to
patch ext_server_name.c as below.

libgnutls: Fix crash when sending repeated client hellos
- --------------------------------------------------------
[GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-2]

The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
triggers a null-pointer dereference.  The fix is to patch
gnutls_handshake.c as below.

libgnutls: Fix crash in cipher padding decoding for invalid record lengths
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
[GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-3]

The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
cause gnutls to read memory beyond the end of the received record.
The fix is to patch gnutls_cipher.c as below.

How to Apply the Patch
- ----------------------

This file has been verified to apply to the latest stable release of
the recent stable branches: version 1.4.5, 1.6.3, 2.0.4, and 2.2.3.
The patch will also work with version 1.2.11 but you will need to
apply it manually.  The patch also apply to the latest development
version 2.3.9 but keep in mind that this version is not intended for
production systems.

The patch was created with 'git-diff', so you will need to use '-p 1'
when invoking patch.  The following illustrate how you apply the patch
against version 1.6.3.

Hello,
The fix for this one (gnutls_cipher.c) breaks clean end of session:

Using 2.2.3:
(SID)address@hidden:/tmp/GNUTLS/gnutls26-2.2.4$ gnutls-cli -p 443 www.gnutls.org
Resolving 'www.gnutls.org'...
[...]
- Handshake was completed

- Simple Client Mode:

get x
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
[...]
</BODY></HTML>
- Peer has closed the GNUTLS connection

Now with 2.2.4:
(SID)address@hidden:/tmp/GNUTLS/gnutls26-2.2.4$ gnutls-cli -p 443 www.gnutls.org
Resolving 'www.gnutls.org'...
- Handshake was completed

- Simple Client Mode:

get x
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
[...]
</BODY></HTML>
*** Fatal error: Decryption has failed.
*** Server has terminated the connection abnormally.

thanks, cu andreas
