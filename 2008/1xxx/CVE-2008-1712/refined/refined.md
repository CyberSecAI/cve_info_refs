- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The `mx_root_path` parameter in the `includes/functions_weblog.php` file is vulnerable to file inclusion. This allows an attacker to include a remote file by manipulating the POST request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `includes/functions_weblog.php` with a malicious URL in the `mx_root_path` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable script.
