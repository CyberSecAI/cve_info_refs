IBM Trusteer analyzes devices on several levels. Device attributes are reviewed and checked for spoofing and abnormalities. Devices are then checked for malware before being scanned for other cybercriminal tools
such as emulators, screen overlays and remote access tools.

Network information is crucial in determining the risk associated with a potential fraudulent activity. Trusteer checks for the location, carrier or hosting service while also detecting whether a VPN is being used or a call is in progress on the device because these are common social engineering techniques.

Behavior of a user can be assessed by looking at behavioral biometrics such as swipes, keystrokes, mouse movements, session length and more. These can be compared to previous user sessions and flagged if discrepancies are detected.

Data relating to the userâ€™s accounts can be key in determining whether a cybercriminal is performing fraudulent activities. Transactional data such as amounts, targeted accounts and transactional types alongside account opening data can be analyzed and used to prevent funneling of funds to criminals.

IBM Trusteer employs a team of world-class threat experts that constantly monitor the dark web to identify emerging threats and devise ways to detect them. In addition, they tap into a global intelligence network of millions of devices across 190 countries by using a unique and persistent fingerprint for every device.

Package        : pdns-recursor
Vulnerability  : design flaw
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1637

Amit Klein discovered that pdns-recursor, a caching DNS resolver, uses a
weak random number generator to create DNS transaction IDs and UDP
source port numbers.  As a result, cache poisoning attacks were
simplified. (CVE-2008-1637)

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.4-1+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pdns-recursor package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

# PowerDNS Recursor: DNS Cache Poisoning â€” GLSA **200804-22**

Use of insufficient randomness in PowerDNS Recursor might lead to DNS cache
poisoning.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-dns/pdns-recursor** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.1.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.1.6** |

### Background

The PowerDNS Recursor is an advanced recursing nameserver.

### Description

Amit Klein of Trusteer reported that insufficient randomness is used to
calculate the TRXID values and the UDP source port numbers
(CVE-2008-1637). Thomas Biege of SUSE pointed out that a prior fix to
resolve this issue was incomplete, as it did not always enable the
stronger random number generator for source port selection
(CVE-2008-3217).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send malicious answers to insert arbitrary DNS
data into the cache. These attacks would in turn help an attacker to
perform man-in-the-middle and site impersonation attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PowerDNS Recursor users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/pdns-recursor-3.1.6"
```
### References

   Global intelligence

IBM Trusteer analyzes devices on several levels. Device attributes are reviewed and checked for spoofing and abnormalities. Devices are then checked for malware before being scanned for other cybercriminal tools
such as emulators, screen overlays and remote access tools.

Network information is crucial in determining the risk associated with a potential fraudulent activity. Trusteer checks for the location, carrier or hosting service while also detecting whether a VPN is being used or a call is in progress on the device because these are common social engineering techniques.

Behavior of a user can be assessed by looking at behavioral biometrics such as swipes, keystrokes, mouse movements, session length and more. These can be compared to previous user sessions and flagged if discrepancies are detected.

Data relating to the userâ€™s accounts can be key in determining whether a cybercriminal is performing fraudulent activities. Transactional data such as amounts, targeted accounts and transactional types alongside account opening data can be analyzed and used to prevent funneling of funds to criminals.

IBM Trusteer employs a team of world-class threat experts that constantly monitor the dark web to identify emerging threats and devise ways to detect them. In addition, they tap into a global intelligence network of millions of devices across 190 countries by using a unique and persistent fingerprint for every device.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- xine NSF buffer overflow
Specially crafted NSF files could potentially be exploited to
execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-1878).
Specially crafted files or streams could potentially be abused to
trick applications that support speex into executing arbitrary code
(CVE-2008-1686).
Updated packages have been released for all SUSE distributions
containing XINE.
- xemacs and emacs fast-lock file problems
Emacs and Xemacs automatically loaded fast-lock files which allowed
local attackers to execute arbitrary code as the user editing the
associated files (CVE-2008-2142).
Xemacs and Emacs have been updated on all SUSE distributions.
- opensuse-updater tmp problems and off-by-one problems
The opensuse-updater on openSUSE 10.2 was updated to fix a symlink
problem and two off-by-one vulnerabilities.
The overflows can be considered no security problem and are tracked
by CVE-2008-2388.
The symlink flaw could be used by local users to gain unauthorized
access to information (like passwords) and is tracked by
CVE-2008-2389.
Only openSUSE 10.2 was affected by this problem.
- libvorbis security problems
Several security problems were fixed in libvorbis:
CVE-2008-1419 - Division by zero
CVE-2008-1420 - integer overflow
CVE-2008-1423 - integer overflow
libvorbis was updated on all SUSE distributions.
- xine sdpplin\_parse overflow
Xine was updated to fix a bug in the function sdpplin\_parse()
that allowed remote attackers to access process memory out-of a
buffers bound.
This vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary code remotely
if successfully exploited. (CVE-2008-0073)
Xine was updated on all SUSE distributions.
- vorbis-tools speex code execution problem
Specially crafted files or streams could potentially be abused to
trick applications that support speex into executing arbitrary code
(CVE-2008-1686) using vorbis-tools.
vorbis-tools was fixed on all SUSE distributions.
- pdns-recursor spoofing problems
Pdns-recursor was prone to a spoofing vulnerability which could be
abused to redirect clients or manipulate data. (CVE-2008-1637)
pdns / pdns-recursor is shipped on SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2
and 10.3 and was fixed there.
- openwsman post-auth remote code execution
Openwsman was updated to provide a fix for the included shttpd
web-server to patch a buffer overflow vulnerability in the HTTP
request parser.
This bug can only be exploited by authenticated users to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the openwsman/shttp
daemon. (CVE-2008-2097)
Only openSUSE 10.3 contains openwsman and was fixed.

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- Linux kernel update
We are currently preparing a kernel update for all products to catch up on security
problems and bugs found in the last months.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
