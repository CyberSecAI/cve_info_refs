\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- sarg buffer overflow
The SQUID logfile analyzer sarg was updated to fix a buffer overflow
that can occur while handling untrusted log data. (CVE-2008-1167)
sarg was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- phpMyAdmin multiple XSS problems
phpMyAdmin was updated to fix multiple cross-site-scripting
vulnerabilities (CVE-2007-6100, CVE-2007-5589).
phpMyAdmin was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- xine FLAC security issues
The multimedia framework xine was updated to fix a possible buffer
overflow that can be triggered via FLAC tags to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2008-0486) and a possible buffer overflow in the matroska
demuxer (CVE-2008-1161).
All Xine versions on our products have been updated.
- bind 1 byte overflow
Certain input data could trigger a buffer overflow in the
'inet\_network' function of libbind.
Applications that use this function could therefore potentially be
crashed or exploited to execute arbitrary code.
The Bind server itself is not affected (CVE-2008-0122).
- dbus-1 policy application problem
The message bus dbus-1 was updated to fix a vulnerability caused by
applying the policies incorrectly. (CVE-2008-0595)
dbus-1 was updated on all distributions.
- silc-toolkit buffer overflow
silc-toolkit was updated to fix a stack-based buffer overflow in
the silc\_fingerprint() function which can possibly be exploited to
execute arbitrary code remotely. (CVE-2008-1227)
silc-toolkit is included only in openSUSE 10.3 and was fixed there.
- boost regular expression problems
Certain regular expressions could cause the boost library to crash
(CVE-2008-0171, CVE-2008-0172).
boost was updated for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux 10.1,
and openSUSE 10.2, 10.3. Older products are not affected.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================

SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing protocol) Toolkit is a software
development kit for use in clients, SILC Server is a communication
server, and SILC Client is an IRSSI-based text client.

### Description

* Nathan G. Grennan reported a boundary error in SILC Toolkit
  within the silc\_fingerprint() function in the file
  lib/silcutil/silcutil.c when passing overly long data, resulting in a
  stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2008-1227).
* A vulnerability
  has been reported in SILC Server which is caused due to an error in the
  handling of "NEW\_CLIENT" packets that do not contain a nickname
  (CVE-2008-1429).
* Ariel Waissbein, Pedro Varangot, Martin
  Mizrahi, Oren Isacson, Carlos Garcia, and Ivan Arce of Core Security
  Technologies reported that SILC Client, Server, and Toolkit contain a
  vulnerability in the silc\_pkcs1\_decode() function in the silccrypt
  library (silcpkcs1.c), resulting in an integer underflow, signedness
  error, and a buffer overflow (CVE-2008-1552).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a Denial
of Service or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SILC Toolkit users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/silc-toolkit-1.1.7"
```

All SILC Client users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/silc-client-1.1.4"
```

All SILC Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/silc-server-1.1.2"
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=372021#c0)  Nathan G. Grennan    2007-11-09 01:51:23 UTC  ``` Description of problem: pidgin crashes on login to a silc account. I tried setting it up fresh, and from old setup. Both caused the crash.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): pidgin-2.2.2-1.fc8.x86_64  How reproducible: Everytime  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install pidgin 2. Run pidgin 3. Setup silc account    Actual results: Crash  Expected results: Runs normally  Additional info: If run from a terminal window it mentions a buffer overflow.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=372021#c1)  luca villa    2007-11-26 21:40:18 UTC  ``` I can confirm this odd behavior that happens just with silc accounts. A workaround for this problem is to downgrade to libsilc-1.0.2-2.fc6, the one installed by default under fedora 7.  This suggest to me that the problem could be in libsilc itself but I didn't investigate deeper.    ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=372021#c2)  Stu Tomlinson    2008-01-04 03:04:16 UTC  ``` I think we'll need a backtrace with both pidgin-debuginfo and libsilc-debuginfo installed to be able to get anywhere with this.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=372021#c3)  luca villa    2008-01-06 15:07:58 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 290915](attachment.cgi?id=290915 "Backtrace with debuginfo") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=290915&action=edit "Backtrace with debuginfo") Backtrace with debuginfo   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=372021#c4)  Stu Tomlinson    2008-01-06 18:13:35 UTC  ``` This appears to be a libsilc problem, could you please try this libsilc package to see if the crash is fixed, and if you are now able to log in to silc? <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/scratch/nosnilmot/task_328484/>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=372021#c5)  luca villa    2008-01-06 21:56:19 UTC  ``` This seems to solve the problem for me. Now I can log in to silc without crashing pidgin anymore.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=372021#c6)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-26 15:42:54 UTC  ``` libsilc-1.0.2-5.fc7 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 7   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=372021#c7)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-26 15:42:57 UTC  ``` libsilc-1.0.2-5.fc8 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 8   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=372021#c8)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-27 07:14:10 UTC  ``` libsilc-1.0.2-5.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 testing repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.  If you want to test the update, you can install it with   su -c 'yum --enablerepo=updates-testing update libsilc'.  You can provide feedback for this update here: <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/F8/FEDORA-2008-1041>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=372021#c9)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-28 21:35:52 UTC  ``` libsilc-1.0.2-5.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=372021#c10)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-28 21:46:11 UTC  ``` libsilc-1.0.2-5.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=372021#c11)  Lubomir Kundrak    2008-03-11 21:01:54 UTC  ``` I'm not convinced the contents of the buffer are in attacker's control; did anyone conduct some investigation?   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=372021#c12)  Stu Tomlinson    2008-03-20 16:41:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=372021#c11)) > I'm not convinced the contents of the buffer are in attacker's control; did > anyone conduct some investigation?  I asked this of upstream and the reply was: > I'm not sure but I think this wasn't so serious.  I never got it crash myself.   ``` |  |
