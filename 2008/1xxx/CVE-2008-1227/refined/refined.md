{
  "CVE-2008-1227": {
    "Description": "A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the silc_fingerprint() function within the SILC Toolkit. This vulnerability can be triggered by providing overly long data.",
    "Root cause": "A boundary error in SILC Toolkit's silc_fingerprint() function when processing overly long data, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application, or cause a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "By providing a crafted input with overly long data to the silc_fingerprint function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted data."
