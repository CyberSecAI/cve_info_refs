How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:03:45 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached Numeric-20.3.ebuild.  This is an update for use with python-2.1  It can be tested by starting a python shell (need a PPM image viewer installed: tkinter will suffice) and >>>from NumTut import * >>>view(greece)  should see a pretty picture.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:05:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10](attachment.cgi?id=10 "Numeric-20.3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=10&action=edit "Numeric-20.3.ebuild")] Numeric-20.3.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:06:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 11](attachment.cgi?id=11 "Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=11&action=edit "Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff")] Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 21:17:27 UTC  ``` This ebuild gives a Access violtion when run through the sandbox.  --------------------------- ACCESS VIOLATION SUMMARY ---------------------------LOG FILE = "/tmp/sandbox-Numeric-20.3-15709.log"  unlink:    /usr/lib/python2.1/distutils/command/install_headers.pyc open_wr:   /usr/lib/python2.1/distutils/command/install_headers.pyc -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-05 03:51:53 UTC  ``` The sandbox violation seems to be python version related.  I don't get a violation building against python-2.2. I even doubted that sandbox was working so I added a 'echo "fail" > /home/tod/tmp/fail.test' to the ebuild install function, and it then generated a access violation (sandbox is nice!).    Bottom line.  The simple fix seems to be change the depends to >=python-2.2 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-10 07:34:59 UTC  ``` added dep on >=python 2.2   ``` |  |

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- wireshark security problems
Multiple flaws in wireshark could lead to crashes when certain
packets are processed (CVE-2008-1561,CVE-2008-1562,CVE-2008-1563)
These problems only affected wireshark in openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3
and were fixed there.
- otrs SOAP command execution
A bug in the trouble ticket system OTRS allowed a remote attacker
to get remote access without specifying a valid user name via the
SOAP interface (CVE-2008-1515).
otrs is only included on openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and was fixed there.
- xine security problems
Specially crafted files could cause integer overflows in the xine
library.
Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user who opened such a file
(CVE-2008-1482).
xine was updated on all SUSE Linux products containing xine.
- xgl various X related security fixes
Xgl uses the XFree86/X.Org code base and so was also affected by
various integer overflow bugs found and fixed in those.
(CVE-2007-6429, CVE-2007-1003, CVE-2007-5958, CVE-2007-6427,
CVE-2007-6428, CVE-2007-6429, CVE-2008-0006)
Xgl was updated on SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10, SUSE Linux 10.1,
openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- silc-toolkit buffer overflow
A flaw in processing PKCS#1-Messages in silc-toolkit could lead
to a buffer overflow. Remote attackers could exploit that to crash
the server. (CVE-2008-1552)
Only openSUSE 10.3 contains silc-toolkit and was fixed.
- lighttpd security problems
Several security problems were fixed in lighttpd.
- Remote attackers were able to crash lighttpd by opening
a large number of connections (CVE-2008-0983).
- A bug in mod\_cgi allowed remote attackers to read
cgi source files (CVE-2008-1111).
- A bug in mod\_userdir allowed remote attackers to read
arbitrary files (CVE-2008-1270).
lighttpd is only included in SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 (SDK),
SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and was fixed for those
distributions.
- tk GIF problems
Specially crafted GIF images could cause a buffer overflow and
crash the toolkit library tk. It seems unlikely but not entirely
impossible that this overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2008-0553).
Tk was updated on all products.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# SILC: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200804-27**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in SILC Client, Server, and Toolkit,
allowing for Denial of Service and execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-im/silc-toolkit** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.7** |

| Package | **net-im/silc-client** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.4** |

| Package | **net-im/silc-server** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.2** |

### Background

SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing protocol) Toolkit is a software
development kit for use in clients, SILC Server is a communication
server, and SILC Client is an IRSSI-based text client.

### Description

* Nathan G. Grennan reported a boundary error in SILC Toolkit
  within the silc\_fingerprint() function in the file
  lib/silcutil/silcutil.c when passing overly long data, resulting in a
  stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2008-1227).
* A vulnerability
  has been reported in SILC Server which is caused due to an error in the
  handling of "NEW\_CLIENT" packets that do not contain a nickname
  (CVE-2008-1429).
* Ariel Waissbein, Pedro Varangot, Martin
  Mizrahi, Oren Isacson, Carlos Garcia, and Ivan Arce of Core Security
  Technologies reported that SILC Client, Server, and Toolkit contain a
  vulnerability in the silc\_pkcs1\_decode() function in the silccrypt
  library (silcpkcs1.c), resulting in an integer underflow, signedness
  error, and a buffer overflow (CVE-2008-1552).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a Denial
of Service or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SILC Toolkit users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/silc-toolkit-1.1.7"
```

All SILC Client users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/silc-client-1.1.4"
```

All SILC Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/silc-server-1.1.2"
```
