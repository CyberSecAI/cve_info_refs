# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1561-1                  security@debian.org

Package        : ldm
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1293
Debian Bug     : 469462

Christian Herzog discovered that within the Linux Terminal Server Project,
it was possible to connect to X on any LTSP client from any host on the
network, making client windows and keystrokes visible to that host.

NOTE: most ldm installs are likely to be in a chroot environment exported
over NFS, and will not be upgraded merely by upgrading the server itself.
For example, on the i386 architecture, to upgrade ldm will likely require:

    chroot /opt/ltsp/i386 apt-get update
    chroot /opt/ltsp/i386 apt-get dist-upgrade

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99debian11+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:0.1~bzr20080308-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ldm package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Subject: CVE request: insecure X11 handling in ltsp

Hi,
Due to passing the -ac option to the X server in ltsp it is possible for any
attacker knowing the victims ip address and the display number to read keystrokes
on the client and display client windows.

Can I get a CVE id for this?
Details on: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=469462>

Cheers
Nico

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: X access wide open on LTSP clients
Date: Wed, 5 Mar 2008 12:16:51 +0100
```
Package: ltsp
Version: 5.0.40~bzr20080214-1~40.etch.0
Severity: critical

X connections to :6 on LTSP clients are possible from any machine on the
network.

Some notes:

- LDM_DIRECTX = False or True does not change anything

thanks for reporting this! i think i have a viable patch below that
fixes the issue, and will include in an upload shortly.

from a post i just made to ltsp-developer@lists.sourceforge.net:

if others haven't figured it out already, it seems like the "-ac" option
(disable access controls) we pass to the X server is what makes it
possible for any person knowing the ip and display number to read
keystrokes on the client and display client windows... a *nasty*
security bug.

it *seems* like the way to ditch it is to *not* pass "-ac" at all, and
to *not* use xauth at all, and it generates a "fake" xauth that isn't
stored anywhere i can find...  but ... is it insecure? it does prevent
any person knowing the ip address and display # to read/write to/from x
clients, and as a side-effect, breaks LDM_DIRECTX. i think that's ok for
the short-term, though long-term i would like to set up proper xauth.

short patch to at least partially address the issue (and hopefully not
provide a false sense of security):

the ldm package in etch is part of the ltsp source, and while i haven't
verified it for sure, i believe it also is affected by the bug.

the ldm version in etch is implemented in python rather than C, so it
will require a totally different patch.

i will be looking into it over the next couple days.

live well,
  vagrant

p.s. please keep CCing the bug report or
pkg-ltsp-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org so that the rest of the pkg-ltsp
team sees the discussion.

yes, i can confirm that the version of ldm (0.99debian11) in etch is
vulnerable.

applied this patch to the ltsp sources in etch, downloaded from:

i've tested that it prevents people from reading/writing to the X
display, and that ldm still can log in to the server.

note that, when making the security advisory, it may be good to mention
that mention that most ldm installs are likely to be in a chroot
environment (the chroot is exported over NFS), and will not be upgraded
merely by upgrading the server itself. for example, on i386, to upgrade
ldm will likely require:

  chroot /opt/ltsp/i386 apt-get update
  chroot /opt/ltsp/i386 apt-get dist-upgrade

if there is any additional assistance needed, please feel free to
contact pkg-ltsp-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org or make further comments

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
