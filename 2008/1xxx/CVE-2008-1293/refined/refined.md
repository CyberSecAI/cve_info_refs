  "CVE-2008-1293": {
    "Description": "The Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) passes the '-ac' option to the X server, which disables access control restrictions. This allows any attacker knowing the victim's IP address and display number to read keystrokes on the client and display client windows.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The X server was launched with the '-ac' option, which disables access controls, making it possible for unauthorized remote access to the X display.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Insecure X11 configuration",
      "Lack of access controls on X server"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read keystrokes on the client and display client windows, leading to potential information disclosure and unauthorized manipulation of the client's desktop environment.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network-based attack",
      "Requires knowledge of the victim's IP address and display number."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the network and have knowledge of the target's IP address and display number to exploit this vulnerability."
