{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `viewsource.php` script in ChartDirector 4.1 does not properly restrict the `file` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify any file path on the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "File Disclosure",
       "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by specifying the file path in the `file` parameter.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `viewsource.php` script with a `file` parameter containing the path of the file to be disclosed.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.",
     "additional_information": "The provided exploit example in the 'POC' section of the exploit-db submission uses `http://site.com/chartdirector/phpdemo/viewsource.php?file=viewsource.php` as an example. This showcases the ability to access the source code of the `viewsource.php` file itself, but any file on the server should be accessible by changing the file parameter to any path."
