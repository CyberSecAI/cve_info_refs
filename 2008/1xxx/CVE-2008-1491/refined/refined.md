    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_dd859f6b_20250124_170313.html",
      "root_cause": "The ASUS DPC Proxy service (versions 2.0.0.16 and 2.0.0.19) has a buffer overflow vulnerability.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "The service does not properly validate the length of the input data it receives, leading to a stack buffer overflow."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the target system.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted, overly long string to the service through its network interface.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service (default port 623)."

      "root_cause": "The DPC Proxy telnet server (part of ASUS Remote Console) has a buffer overflow vulnerability.",
      "weaknesses": [
          "The function handling received data stores it in a fixed-size stack buffer (~1024 bytes) without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to write past the buffer's boundaries."
        ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution.",
      "attack_vector": "By sending an overly long string to the telnet server on port 623.",
