Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1869:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw in the Site Sift scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is SQL injection in the `id` parameter of the `index.php?go=detail` script.
- The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database. Specifically, the provided exploit demonstrates extracting usernames and passwords from the `admin` table.
- While the provided note states that the attacker did not change the passwords, it highlights the potential for more severe impact, including complete database access and manipulation by a malicious actor.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL parameter, specifically the `id` parameter in the `index.php?go=detail` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special access or privileges are required to send the malicious request.
- The attacker needs to be able to identify the vulnerable script (`index.php?go=detail`) and the vulnerable parameter (`id`).
- Some knowledge of SQL is required to construct the appropriate injection payload.

**Detailed Explanation of Exploit**
- The provided exploits use a `UNION SELECT` injection to retrieve data from the database.
- The attacker sets the `id` parameter to a negative number (-99999) followed by a SQL comment (`/**/`)  to avoid an error due to invalid id, then crafts a `UNION SELECT` query that retrieves the username and password from the `admin` table.
- `concat(username,0x3a,password)` concatenates username and password from the `admin` table, separating them with a colon (0x3a).
- The exploit includes null values to match the columns of the original select statement.
- The exploit attempts to extract information from the `admin` table, and specifies more columns just in case they are required.
