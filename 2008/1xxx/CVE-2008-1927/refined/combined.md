# USN-700-2: Perl regression

15 January 2009

Perl regression

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [perl](/security/cves?package=perl) -

## Details

USN-700-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Perl. Due to problems with the Ubuntu

8.04 build, some Perl .ph files were missing from the resulting update.

This update fixes the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Jonathan Smith discovered that the Archive::Tar Perl module did not

correctly handle symlinks when extracting archives. If a user or

automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted tar file,

a remote attacker could over-write arbitrary files. ([CVE-2007-4829](/security/CVE-2007-4829))

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that Perl did not correctly

handle certain utf8 characters in regular expressions. If a user or

automated system were tricked into using a specially crafted expression,

a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial

of service. Ubuntu 8.10 was not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-1927](/security/CVE-2008-1927))

A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module's rmtree

function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user's call

of rmtree, they could create arbitrary setuid binaries. Ubuntu 6.06

and 8.10 were not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-5302](/security/CVE-2008-5302))

A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module's rmtree

function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user's call of

rmtree, they could delete arbitrary files. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected

by this issue. ([CVE-2008-5303](/security/CVE-2008-5303))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [perl](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/perl)
  -
  [5.8.8-12ubuntu0.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/perl/5.8.8-12ubuntu0.4)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

The helper library neon was updated to fix a NULL pointer dereference
in the digest authentication code. (CVE-2008-3746)
neon was updated on all affected distributions.
- rxvt-unicode session hijacking
Using rxvt-unicode it was possible to open a terminal on :0 when
the environment variable was not set.
This could be exploited by local users to hijack X11 connections (CVE-2008-1142).
rxvt-unicode was updated on openSUSE 10.2-11.0.
- perl multiple problems
Several problems were fixed in the scripting language perl.
Specially crafted regular expressions could crash perl
(CVE-2008-1927).
Insufficient symlink checks in the File::Path could result in wrong
file permissions (CVE-2008-2827).
Additionally problem in the CGI module was fixed that could result
in an endless loop if uploads were canceled.
- Wireshark / ethereal multiple security problems
Various vulnerabilities have been fixed in ethereal and wireshark:
CVE-2008-3137, CVE-2008-3138, CVE-2008-3139,
CVE-2008-3140, CVE-2008-3141, CVE-2008-3145
and CVE-2008-3146. Those could be potentially used to crash
wireshark or potentially execute code.

Updates have been released for openSUSE 10.3, other distributions
were not affected.
- MySQL security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix a security problem:
CVE-2008-2079: MySQL allowed local users to bypass certain privilege
checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1)
DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within
the MySQL home data directory, which can point to tables that are
created in the future.
CVE-2006-7232: sql\_select.cc in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.32 and 5.1.x
before 5.1.14 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA
table, as originally demonstrated using ORDER BY.
MySQL was updated on all SUSE Linux distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may

Perl vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [libarchive-tar-perl](/security/cves?package=libarchive-tar-perl) -
* [perl](/security/cves?package=perl) -

## Details

Jonathan Smith discovered that the Archive::Tar Perl module did not

correctly handle symlinks when extracting archives. If a user or

automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted tar file,

a remote attacker could over-write arbitrary files. ([CVE-2007-4829](/security/CVE-2007-4829))

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that Perl did not correctly

handle certain utf8 characters in regular expressions. If a user or

automated system were tricked into using a specially crafted expression,

a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial

of service. Ubuntu 8.10 was not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-1927](/security/CVE-2008-1927))

A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module's rmtree

function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user's call

of rmtree, they could create arbitrary setuid binaries. Ubuntu 6.06

and 8.10 were not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-5302](/security/CVE-2008-5302))

A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module's rmtree

function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user's call of

rmtree, they could delete arbitrary files. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected

by this issue. ([CVE-2008-5303](/security/CVE-2008-5303))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

perl security update (RHSA-2008-0532)

Original Release Date: July 31, 2008

Last Revised: July 31, 2008

Number: ASA-2008-317

Risk Level: None

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Perl is a high-level programming language commonly used for system
administration utilities and Web programming.

A flaw was found in Perl's regular expression engine. A specially crafted
regular expression with Unicode characters could trigger a buffer overflow,
causing Perl to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Perl.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-1927](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1927) to this issue.

This advisory is specific to versions of perl shipped with Red Hat Application Stack v1(RHASv1)
for Enterprise Linux 4 (RHEL4).

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0532.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with RHASv1 for RHEL4 versions of perl installed: None

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package is installed,
Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

Subject: double free and segfault on utf8 containing regexes
Date: Fri, 7 Dec 2007 14:03:25 -0800
```
[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=454792;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: perl
Severity: serious
Version: 5.8.8-7etch1
Tags: security

A trivial program containing a regex with UTF8 characters causes a
double free error and segfault:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w -CSDA
use strict;
use utf8;
use encoding 'utf8';
use locale;

my $ans='Ostrów';
$_="whatever...";
if (/^$ans| $ans/) { print "I was wrong, sorry...\n"}

[Attached as well for convenience, along with output.]

I've set the severity to serious and tagged with security as there is
(apparently) a possibility that this could result in execution of
arbitrary code. [I don't have any proof of concept for this or a CVE
though, so feel free to detag and lower severity.]

This is also filed upstream as #48156 [will mark it forwarded after I
receive the ack.]

[We're seeing this quite a bit in the anti-spam bits of the BTS, so a
patch which fixes this would be nice. ;-)]

Subject: using utf8 module instead of enconding should work

```
As commented on this Perl Monks node:
<http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=674382>

The utf8 module works fine with Unicode in Perl regexes,
so in the sample above just remove the "use encoding ..."
line to get rid of the double free bug.

There are still problems with 5.10.0, but they only show up for me with
'debugperl -Dm'. Note that '-Dm' crashes anyway when it's done due to
#474613, but we don't get that far here.

(BTW, the '-CSDA' perl option in the original example doesn't affect
 this and needs to be removed when testing with 5.10.0.)

5.10.0-7 on amd64:

Further investigation shows that the -Dm problems are a separate issue
specific to 5.10.0. I'll discuss those in #474613.

The utf8 regexp crash is fixed upstream by

Change 29204 by merijn@merijn-pc09 on 2006/11/04 19:15:19

which is in 5.10.0, so closing at 5.10.0-1 (ie. fixed-in-experimental).

It was backported to the 5.8-maint branch as change 32364 after 5.8.8
was released.

I'm unsure about the security implications. Will ask for opinions on p5p.

Apparently [perl #40641] is a duplicate of the same issue. I'll send
note about this in the upstream ticket.

I'm attaching a patch for 5.8.8-12 (sid), and it applies with minimal
fuzz against 5.8.8-7etch1 too. I have built 5.8.8-12 with this and
verified that it doesn't crash anymore.

As mentioned earlier in this report, 'use utf8' instead of
'use encoding "utf8"' is a (possibly incomplete) workaround.

No response from either in two weeks, so it seems that nobody is
particularly concerned. Detagging and lowering the severity as suggested.
If anybody disagrees, please speak up and undo the control part.

It's potentially security-relevant if it can be exploited by
UTF-8-decoding some input within the script.

Has there been any reaction on perl-5-porters (I guess this is what p5p
stands for)?

Okay, next opinion, after actually investigating the bug (not so much
"different bug", but "wrong impression after seeing the uuencode blob"):

This bug also happens with

  if (/^\Q$ans\E| \Q$ans\E/) { print "I was wrong, sorry...\n"}

(the recommended method of including untrusted input in regular
expressions).  As a result, I fear that it opens a DoS vector in quite a
few services.

How much testing has this patch:

<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=26;filename=27_fix_regcomp_utf8;att=1;bug=454792>

received?

Are there any other issues we should bundle with an update?

```

No reaction except a mention in "This Week on perl5-porters":

 <http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2008/04/msg135902.html>

It's picked from the upstream branch that's soon going to be released
as 5.8.9.

I have verified that it fixes the reported segfault and built a local
package passing the test suite on i386/sid on top of 5.8.8-12.

> Are there any other issues we should bundle with an update?

Please look at #470676, which I also Cc'd the security team about today.

No other issues that I know about. Brendan?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  Impact: Using the FSEvents framework, a local user may be able to see filesystem activity that would otherwise not be available

  Description: A credential management issue exists in fseventsd. By using the FSEvents framework, a local user may be able to see filesystem activity that would otherwise not be available. This includes the name of a directory which the user would not otherwise be able to see, and the detection of activity in the directory at a given time. This update addresses the issue through improved credential validation in fseventsd. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5. Credit to Mark Dalrymple for reporting this issue.

perl security update (RHSA-2008-0522)

Original Release Date: August 22, 2008

Last Revised: June 30, 2009

Number: ASA-2008-361

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 7.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Perl is a high-level programming language commonly used for system
administration utilities and Web programming.

Due to a flaw in Perl's regular expression engine a specially crafted
regular expression with Unicode characters could trigger a buffer
overflow,
causing Perl to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Perl. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2008-1927](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1927) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0522.html>

**Recommended Actions:**
For all vulnerable system products,
Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied by RedHat Linux.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Synopsis

Important: perl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0522)

## Topic

Updated perl packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Perl is a high-level programming language commonly used for system
administration utilities and Web programming.

A flaw was found in Perl's regular expression engine. A specially crafted
regular expression with Unicode characters could trigger a buffer overflow,
causing Perl to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Perl. (CVE-2008-1927)

Users of perl are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
