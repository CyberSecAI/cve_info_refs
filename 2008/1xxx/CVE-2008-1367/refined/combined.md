## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0508)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and a bug are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

These updated packages fix the following security issues:

* A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel memory copy routines, when

running on certain AMD64 systems. If an unsuccessful attempt to copy kernel
memory from source to destination memory locations occurred, the copy
routines did not zero the content at the destination memory location. This
could allow a local unprivileged user to view potentially sensitive data.
(CVE-2008-2729, Important)

* Alexey Dobriyan discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel

process-tracing system call, ptrace. A local unprivileged user could
use this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel hang).
(CVE-2008-2365, Important)

* Tavis Ormandy discovered a deficiency in the Linux kernel 32-bit and

64-bit emulation. This could allow a local unprivileged user to prepare and
run a specially crafted binary, which would use this deficiency to leak
uninitialized and potentially sensitive data. (CVE-2008-0598, Important)

* It was discovered that the Linux kernel handled string operations in the

opposite way to the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). This could allow a local
unprivileged user to cause memory corruption. (CVE-2008-1367, Low)

As well, these updated packages fix the following bug:

* On systems with a large number of CPUs (more than 16), multiple

applications calling the "times()" system call may have caused a system
hang.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

Subject: libc6: New version of libc6 hangs SBCL
Package: libc6
Version: 2.7-9
Severity: critical
Justification: breaks unrelated software

*** Please type your report below this line ***

After upgrading to 2.7-9 of libc6 in unstable, SBCL became extremely
prone to crashing
randomly (i.e. 5-10 source files compiled of the SBCL CVS code before a
100% CPU hang which
was only killable with -s 9.

The issue was originally raised on the SBCL devel list here:

[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.steel-bank.devel/10902/focus=10905](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.steel-bank.devel/10902/focus%3D10905)

I upgraded the system from libc6 2.7-8, which seems to have caused the
problem. Downgrading
libc6 to the package in testing (libc 2.7-6) fixes it again: I've since
compiled sbcl from
CVS twice to make sure.

Rupert Swarbrick

P.S. The System Information below was generated with reportbug and I've
currently got 2.7-6
installed. libgcc1 doesn't seem to have been up/down-graded, though, so
I think the below is
mostly true except for the "testing" bits, since all other libraries are
at the current
versions in unstable.

Could you please give a way to reproduce the bug? I know nothing about
SBCL, so a list of commands to execute or a shell script would be nice.

Could you please try to narrow the problem to a single libc6 version?
Older versions are available on snapshot.debian.net.

Of course, sorry. Probably the easiest option is to get sbcl and darcs
(the version control system). It doesn't appear to matter which version
of sbcl - I've had the problem with 1.0.12 up to 1.0.14.

Then get clbuild (which is a little shell script which can among other
things get and build a new copy of sbcl, which is a project large enough
to guarantee the hang on my computer at least) using

darcs get <http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/clbuild>

Chmod +x the clbuild script inside the folder and cd inside and run

./clbuild buildsbcl

Hopefully (!) your system should hang at 100% CPU with the sbcl process
ignoring SIGTERM. Sorry about the involved duplication process - it's
just that you need to compile quite a bit of code before the seemingly
"random" bug strikes.

Could you let me know a way to convince dpkg to let me do that? Since
you have to up/downgrade a dependent package at the same time, and I'm a
bit scared of using --force-all on libc6 on my only computer! (Or am I
being needlessly cautious?)

Incidentally, as someone pointed out in the sbcl thread I linked to,
it's quite possible that your change in libc6 has thrown up a bug in
sbcl rather than the other way round - we're trying (and failing) to get
strace,gdb to tell us something useful about where sbcl died. However,
I'd be extremely grateful if you could suggest what change you think is
likely to be able to cause this sort of symptom - and I stand by my
categorization: the change definitely breaks an unrelated package :P

Thanks for the really prompt response!

Rupert

The problem started for me when this upgrade happened:
[UPGRADE] libc6 2.7-8 -> 2.7-9
[UPGRADE] libc6-dev 2.7-8 -> 2.7-9
and was not happening before.  Thus it is the changes in going to
2.7-9 from 2.7-8 that reveal this problem.

I am able to reproduce the bug, except that here the sbcl process hangs
with 0% CPU.

Theoretically if you upgrade/downgrade all libc6 related packages
(libc6-dev, libc6-i686, ...) at the same time it should work.

Anyway now that I am able to reproduce the problem, I can do that myself.

I get to the same conclusion. The only relevant change I could see
between 2.7-8 and 2.7-9 is the switch to gcc-4.3 from gcc-4.2 to build
the glibc. I will try to confirm this is the culprit.

I confirm that switch to gcc-4.3 from gcc-4.2 causes the problem. The
next step, understandy why, won't be that easy.

```
Looking at <http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/changes.html>, this is the only
thing that really jumps out:

"GCC no longer places the cld instruction before string operations.
Both i386 and x86-64 ABI documents mandate the direction flag to be
clear at the entry of a function. It is now invalid to set the flag in
asm statement without reseting it afterward."

...but (1) SBCL _should_ be resetting the direction flag before any
calls to libc code, and (2) I would expect problems caused by this to
be more deterministic.

Cheers,

 -- Nikodemus

On my side, I have made some progress. I have rebuilt a glibc with
gcc-4.3 for all files except the signal/ directory, built with gcc-4.2
instead. SBCL seems to work correctly in this case.

It actually doesn't reset it. The problem causes the sigemptyset()
function from the glibc to not work correctly.

I have identified the potential part from SBCL causing the problem, I am
currently testing a fix.

Please find below the patch to fix the problem. I only tested on amd64,
but it should work the same way on i386.

Thanks for the patch, but... while I agree that it is good to change
SBCL to reset the direction flag every time it is diddled, instead of
just before calling C, I don't think SBCL is actually at fault here.

 1. SBCL does actually reset DF before any call to foreign (GCC generated) code.
    See line 236 in src/compiler/x86/c-call.lisp, and line 125 in
    src/runtime/x86-assem.S.

    (It is possible I'm missing out a call-path here, but even so, read on and
    see if my fears are unfounded or not.)

 2. If the problem was due to a foreign call, it should be deterministic.

 3. If the problem was due to _returning_ to main(), it should be deterministic.

What I suspect is actually going on (especially considering your
statement that compiling signals/ with 4.2 avoided the issue) is that
a signal handler is entered while DF is set.

If this is the case, then clearing it right after each REP loop where
SBCL uses it just makes seeing the bug much more unlikely -- but not
impossible in the presence of async signals.

If so, this may also explain some _very_ hard to reproduce faults we
have seen over the years: using a pre 4.3-GCC compiled libc, a signal
at an in opportune moment in the middle of a REP loop could clear DF!
Yikes!

I'm not sure what is The Right Thing here, though. Should SBCL (and
_any_ program that ever sets DF!) save, clear, and restore DF in its
signal handlers? Should libc/kernel do that? Should signals be blocked
before ever setting DF? Is setting DF Just A Bad Idea?

Cheers,

Looks correct.

What I am sure is that sigemptyset() from the glibc is called with the
direction flag set, and that should not happen.

Seems correct, though I have made half a dozen of build here, without
any problem.

I currently have no idea about that.

I don't think so. Not setting DF means less optimized code has to be used.

Right.

I'm about to merge a patch to SBCL based on yours, which moves all DF
resets to immediate vicinity of STDs for easier auditing, and removed
the then-unnecessary CLD instructions from foreign call sequences.
This will fix them symptoms, and be good for SBCL, but I think the
underlying problem is still there in signal handling. :/

That is not too suprising: the are normally no asynch signals
delivered during the build, but SIGSEGV is a regular occurance (it is
used by the GC), so SIGSEGV handlers may have been seeing the DF set.

What _is_ strange is that this appears to have been random. (At least
all the reporters seemed to characterize it as semirandom behaviour.)
Multiple builds from the same source with the same host compiler
should have essentially identical GC characteristics.

I'll see if I can cook up a small test-case using async signals. (One
that doesn't need SBCL so that it can be passed to upstream libc /
kernel people if necessary without too much friction.)

Well it may depends on the kernel. On one machine, it was hanging
randomly. On another machine, I get an error from GC at the very
beginning of the build.

GCC developer says it's the job of the kernel. I doubt the glibc can do
something here, that's the kernel which calls the signal handler.

I doubt this is related, as the flags register is saved by gcc upon
enter to the signal handler and restored upon exit.

The small code below exhibits the problem. It was there already with
gcc-4.2, but in that case, gcc generates a cld or std instruction
before any instruction that uses the direction flag.

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>

void handler(int signal) {
	uint64_t rflags;

	asm volatile("pushfq ; popq %0" : "=g" (rflags));

	if (rflags & (1 << 10))
		printf("DF = 1\n");
	else
		printf("DF = 0\n");
}

int main() {
	signal(SIGUSR1, handler);

	while(1)
	{
		asm volatile("std\r\n");
	}
}

That's definitively a kernel/gcc-4.3 problem, I have reported it
upstream: <http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/5/207>

I am therefore reassigning the bug to those packages.

Now that the situation is more clear, let's clone/reassign the bugs to
the right packages. While the kernels have to be fixed, gcc 4.3
behavior wrt to cld/std has to be reverted to the old behavior to
ensure an upgrade path from Etch.

So let's summarize:
- linux 2.6 has to be fixed. A patch is available on the lkml [1] for
  2.6.25-rc. It could be easily backported to 2.6.24
- kfreebsd 6 and 7 exhibit the same behavior. They have to be fixed
- hurd crashes in this case. It has to be fixed
- gcc 4.3 should not strictly follow the ABI when it comes to cld/std
  and use the old behavior, which is now a de facto ABI for some time.
- glibc 2.7-9 is broken with the current kernels. It has to be rebuilt
  with a fixed gcc.

The patch for 2.6.25-rc went upstream. Please find a backported patch
for 2.6.24 below.

x86: Clear DF before calling signal handler

The Linux kernel currently does not clear the direction flag before
calling a signal handler, whereas the x86/x86-64 ABI requires that.
This become a real problem with gcc version 4.3, which assumes that
the direction flag is correctly cleared at the entry of a function.

This patches changes the setup_frame() functions to clear the
direction before entering the signal handler.

Perhaps this [1] helps.  The rest of the thread is a big discussion
about whose fault this is ;)

Oops I've sent the wrong patch. Please find the correct patch below:

commit 9b25e7f72161a95d7e255b0277c951f7f9aee59f

    x86: Clear DF before calling signal handler

    The Linux kernel currently does not clear the direction flag before
    calling a signal handler, whereas the x86/x86-64 ABI requires that.
    This become a real problem with gcc version 4.3, which assumes that
    the direction flag is correctly cleared at the entry of a function.

    This patches changes the setup_frame() functions to clear the
    direction before entering the signal handler.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This kernel update fixes the following security problems:
CVE-2007-6282: A remote attacker could crash the IPSec/IPv6 stack
by sending a bad ESP packet. This requires the host to be able to
receive such packets (default filtered by the firewall).
CVE-2008-1615: On x86\_64 systems a denial of service attack could be
used by local attackers to immediately panic / crash the machine.
CVE-2008-1375: Fixed a dnotify race condition, which could be used
by local attackers to potentially execute code.
CVE-2008-1367: Clear the "direction" flag before calling signal
handlers. For specific not yet identified programs under specific
timing conditions this could potentially have caused memory corruption
or code execution.
Other changes and improvements include:
- OCFS2 updated to 1.2.9
- Significant bug fixes.
More details are available in the RPM changelog.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
You need to reboot the machine after installing this update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

    x86: clear DF before calling signal handler

    The Linux kernel currently does not clear the direction flag before
    calling a signal handler, whereas the x86/x86-64 ABI requires that.

    Linux had this behavior/bug forever, but this becomes a real problem
    with gcc version 4.3, which assumes that the direction flag is
    correctly cleared at the entry of a function.

    This patches changes the setup_frame() functions to clear the
    direction before entering the signal handler.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Linux kernel update was updated on openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 to fix
the following security problems:
CVE-2008-2136: A problem in SIT IPv6 tunnel handling could be used
by remote attackers to immediately crash the machine.
CVE-2007-6282: A remote attacker could crash the IPSec/IPv6 stack
by sending a bad ESP packet. This requires the host to be able to
receive such packets (default filtered by the firewall).
CVE-2007-5904: A remote buffer overflow in CIFS was fixed which
could potentially be used by remote attackers to crash the machine
or potentially execute code.
CVE-2008-1615: On x86\_64 a denial of service attack could be used by
local attackers to immediately panic / crash the machine.
CVE-2008-2358: A security problem in DCCP was fixed, which could be
used by remote attackers to crash the machine. Only a fix for openSUSE
10.2 was necessary.
CVE-2008-2148: The permission checking in sys\_utimensat was incorrect
and local attackers could change the file times of files they do not
own to the current time.
CVE-2007-6206: An information leakage during core dumping of root
processes was fixed. This problem was already fixed for openSUSE 10.3
previously and was now fixed for openSUSE 10.2.
CVE-2007-6712: A integer overflow in the hrtimer\_forward function
(hrtimer.c) in Linux kernel, when running on 64-bit systems, allows
local users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a timer
with a large expiry value, which causes the timer to always be expired.
CVE-2008-1669: Fixed a SMP ordering problem in fcntl\_setlk could
potentially allow local attackers to execute code by timing file
locking.
CVE-2008-1367: Clear the "direction" flag before calling signal
handlers. For specific not yet identified programs under specific
timing conditions this could potentially have caused memory corruption
or code execution.
CVE-2008-1375: Fixed a dnotify race condition, which could be used
by local attackers to potentially execute code.
CVE-2007-5500: A ptrace bug could be used by local attackers to hang
their own processes indefinitely.
Also various non security bugs were fixed, please see the RPM changelogs.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

# [PATCH, i386]: Emit cld instruction when stringops are used

* *From*: "Uros Bizjak" <ubizjak at gmail dot com>
* *To*: "gcc patches" <gcc-patches at gcc dot gnu dot org>
* *Date*: Thu, 6 Mar 2008 16:55:21 +0100
* *Subject*: [PATCH, i386]: Emit cld instruction when stringops are used

---

```
Hello!

This patch adds back generation of cld instructions when stringops are
used in the function. cld insn is emitted as unspec volatile at the
end of function prologue. Currently, patched gcc emits cld when
"-mcld" is added to compile flags.

Currently, there is no configure-time support, I think we should first
reach a consensus on how to configure this. We can

./configure --with-cld (or something), where no cld generation is default.

Anyway the code for:

--cut here--
extern void *memcpy (void *, const void *, __SIZE_TYPE__);

int foo[10];
int bar[10];

char baz[15];
char quux[15];

void
do_copy ()
{
  memcpy (foo, bar, sizeof foo);
  memcpy (baz, quux, sizeof baz);
}
--cut here--

now generates (gcc -Os):

do_copy:
        pushl   %ebp
        movl    %esp, %ebp
        pushl   %edi
        pushl   %esi
        subl    $8, %esp
        cld                                       <- here
        movl    $foo, %edi
        movl    $bar, %esi
        movl    $10, %ecx
        rep movsl
        movl    $baz, %edi
        movl    $quux, %esi
        movb    $15, %cl
        rep movsb
        popl    %eax
        popl    %edx
        popl    %esi
        popl    %edi
        popl    %ebp
        ret

	* config/i386/i386.h (TARGET_CLD): New define.
	(struct machine_function): Add needs_cld field.
	(ix86_current_function_needs_cld): New define.
	* config/i386/i386.md (UNSPEC_CLD): New unspec volatile constant.

	* config/i386/i386.c (ix86_expand_prologue): Emit cld insn for

The patch was bootstrapped on i686-pc-linux-gnu, regression test with
-mcld is in progress.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

No, this patch in effect restores previous functionality for what is
considered buggy code (in the sense that doesn't follow psABI w.r.t. to
direction flag). This patch should be treated as a band-aid for corner
cases, nothing less and nothing more. In previous versions, inline asm
was not handled at all and all [asm] code was written with this fact in
mind.

Due to this, IMO there is no point to implement cld inserting via LCM
(this would require major work, since we will have to restore REG\_DIR
fake register in order to make \_all\_ stringop patterns consumers of this
register). There is also no point to trigger cld insertion with inline
asm, as this will fix a non-bug.

IMO, -mcld should be off by default. This flag should provide a way to
still compile the code that is now \_known\_ to be buggy. But it is up to
distributions to decide if they want to penalize applications with
unnecessary cld instructions. I expect that the need for -mcld will
phase out relatively quickly.

Uros.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=437312#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-03-13 15:03:34 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Jake Edge has reported the following gcc kernel related potential security issue on LWN:  <cite>  A change to GCC for a recent release coupled with a kernel bug has created a messy situation, with possible security implications. GCC changed some assumptions about x86 processor flags, in accordance with the ABI standard, that can lead to memory corruption for programs built with GCC 4.3.0. No one has come up with a way to exploit the flaw, at least yet, but it clearly is a problem that needs to be addressed.  The problem revolves around the x86 direction flag (DF), which governs whether block memory operations operate forward through memory or backwards. The main use for the flag is to support overlapping memory copies, where working backwards through memory may be required so that the data being copied does not get overwritten as the copy progresses. Debian hacker Aurélien Jarno reported the problem to linux-kernel on March 5th, which was found when building Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) using the new compiler.  GCC's most recent release, 4.3.0, assumes that the direction flag has been cleared (i.e. memory operations go in a forward direction) at the entry of each function, as is specified by the ABI (which is, somewhat amusingly, found at sco.com [PDF]). Unfortunately, this clashes with Linux signal handlers, which get called, incorrectly, with the flag in whatever state it was in when the signal occurred. This has the effect of leaking one bit of state from the user space process that was running when the signal occurred to the signal handler, which could be in another process.  That, in itself, is a bug, seemingly with fairly minimal impact. Prior to 4.3, GCC would emit a cld (clear direction flag) opcode before doing inline string or memory operations, so those operations would start from a known state. In 4.3, GCC relies on the ABI mandate that the direction flag is cleared before entry to a function, which means that the kernel needs to arrange that before calling a signal handler. It currently doesn't, but a small patch fixes that.  The window of vulnerability is small, but was observed in SBCL. The sequence of events that would lead to memory corruption are as follows:      * a user space program does an operation (memmove() for example) that       sets DF     * a signal occurs for some process     * the kernel calls the signal handler     * the signal handler does a memmove() in what it thinks is a forward         direction     * the memory is copied in the reverse direction, leading to corruption  </cite>  Link to the post:  <http://lwn.net/Articles/272048/#Comments>  Link to upstream fix:  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git;a=commitdiff;h=52c841e1012b8e73cc04b53f92fb933db580fb42>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=437312#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-03-13 15:04:37 UTC  ``` Additional comment from [BZ#436131](show_bug.cgi?id=436131 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-1367 [RHEL5] Kernel doesn't clear DF for signal handlers"):  The debian folks reported that kernel doesn't ensure direction flag is cleared upon entry to signal handler, which violates both i?86 and x86_64 ABIs. Old GCCs conservatively used cld anyway before using any instructions that use that flag, but GCC 4.3 no longer does that, it relies on the ABI guarantees that on entry to a function the direction flag must be cleared. See <http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2006-12/msg00276.html> Anything that uses std instruction must cld again before calling another function or before returning from function. Unfortunately, if async signal is sent while a thread has std flag set, kernel will start a signal handler with DF flag set.  The fix is addition of regs->eflags &= ~X86_EFLAGS_DF; or similar in setup_frame/setup_rt_frame (i386, x86_64, x86_64 32-bit support).  While only code compiled with GCC 4.3 and later will be affected by this bug, RHEL5 kernels are often used with later Fedora userland (e.g. koji buildboxes), so IMHO if at all possible to fix should be backported to RHEL5.2 and perhaps even RHEL4.7 kernels.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=437312#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-03-13 15:05:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 297943](attachment.cgi?id=297943 "Testcase for finding out the value of the DF flag.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=297943&action=edit "Testcase for finding out the value of the DF flag.") Testcase for finding out the value of the DF flag.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=437312#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-03-13 15:08:38 UTC  ``` Comments from Jason Baron and reply from Jakub Jelinek describing the  current behaviour and the nature of the bug:  <cite jbaron>  Whenever i run the test case (sending SIGUSR1 to the test process), i get: 'DF = 1'. indicating that the the df flag is set...I expected it to be unset b/c from reading this gcc clears the df flags...i've tried older distros and compat-gcc and still i get DF = 1...what am i missing? thanks.  </cite>  <cite jakub>  If you get DF = 1, then that means the kernel is buggy.  The psABI says that the DF flag must be clear upon entry to a function and also on exit from function.  GCC <= 4.2.x would add cld just in case, whenever it used some string instruction (movs*/stos*/loads*/cmps* etc.), GCC 4.3.0 relies on the ABI guarantee.  As GCC itself never issues std insn, it is just inline or out-of-line assembly which has to reset cld after it did std (AFAIK all such assembly I saw does that), the kernel has to start a process with cleared DF flag (also done) and the kernel signal handler needs to clear it for the signal handler (this is the bug).  </cite>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=437312#c9)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-03-13 15:55:40 UTC  ``` Valid link to upstream kernel commit:  <http://marc.info/?l=git-commits-head&m=120492000901739&w=2>  And the following one:  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=e40cd10ccff3d9fbffd57b93780bee4b7b9bff51>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=437312#c10)  Joshua Giles    2008-04-28 18:33:10 UTC  ``` Hi Jan,  Can you post the rhel3 committed patch for clarification?  I see some usage of the DF flag but it's unlike the upstream version.     ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=437312#c14)  Vincent Danen    2010-12-23 16:45:19 UTC  ``` This was addressed via:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 3 (RHSA-2008:0211) Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 5 (RHSA-2008:0233) Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 4 (RHSA-2008:0508)   ``` |  |

Hi,

Let's not muddy the water by dragging an irrelevant topic (inline asm)
into the discussion.

On Fri, 7 Mar 2008, Chris Lattner wrote:

No he isn't.  The DF flag is clear on entry and exit of functions.  How it
behaves inside the function is of no concern to the ABI.  Inline asm is
completely outside the scope, and instead is of interest to the code
generator of GCC only.  Inline asm authors simply have to cope with that,
and they do.

There are no documented guarantees on how DF is set or not set on entry of
asm blocks, hence there are none.  The most conservative assumption for
asm authors would be to not touch the flag at all, the next (still
working) guidance would to leave asms with DF clear.  But GCC won't ever
prevent you from doing otherwise and shooting yourself, like it won't
prevent you from or taking care of clobbering the PIC register in inline
asms.

If inline asm authors want to rely on DF being clear on function entry
they have to write their asms at the start of a function, and even then
they won't have this guarantee (as GCC is free to emit whatever code it
wants to between entry point and asm start, that is true also for volatile
asm).  The only way for asm authors to exploit the ABI guarantee at all is
by writing naked asm functions without prologue, at which point it makes
more sense to just write them in an .S file yourself.  Then you can enjoy
the ABI guarantees, but also need to take care to not break them.

Ciao,
Michael.

```

You forget that there is a ton of code in the world that does:

```
void foo() {
  asm ( " rep; movsb", ...)
}
```

Knowing that the direction flag is clear on entry to the function.
You propose auditing all the \*existing\* inline asm code active in the
world? I thought the issue here was that \*user\* space can't trust
that the direction flag is clear because of the kernel bug: if so,
this isn't just about inline asm in the kernel.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

By **Jake Edge**
March 7, 2008

A change to GCC for a recent release coupled with a kernel bug has created
a messy situation, with possible security implications. GCC changed some
assumptions about x86 processor flags, in accordance with the ABI standard,
that can lead to memory corruption for programs built with GCC 4.3.0. No
one has come up with a way to exploit the flaw, at least yet, but it
clearly is a problem that needs to be addressed.

The problem revolves around the x86 direction flag (DF), which governs
whether block memory operations operate forward through memory or
backwards. The main use for the flag is to support overlapping memory
copies, where working backwards through memory may be required so that the data
being copied does not get overwritten as the copy progresses. Debian
hacker Aurélien Jarno [reported the problem to
linux-kernel](http://lwn.net/Articles/272204/) on March 5th, which was found when building Steel Bank
Common Lisp (SBCL) using the new compiler.

GCC's [most recent
release](http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/changes.html), 4.3.0, assumes that the direction flag has been cleared
(i.e. memory operations go in a forward direction) at the entry of each
function, as is specified by the ABI (which is, somewhat amusingly, [found at
sco.com](http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/abi386-4.pdf) [PDF]). Unfortunately, this clashes with
Linux signal handlers, which get called, incorrectly, with the flag in
whatever state it was in when the signal occurred. This has the effect of
leaking one bit of state from the user space process that was running when
the signal occurred to the signal handler, which could be in another process.

That, in itself, is a bug, seemingly with fairly minimal impact. Prior to 4.3, GCC
would emit a cld (clear direction flag) opcode before doing inline
string
or memory operations, so those operations would start from a known state.
In 4.3, GCC relies on the ABI mandate that the direction flag is cleared before
entry to a function, which means that the kernel needs to arrange that
before calling a signal handler. It currently doesn't, but a [small patch](http://lwn.net/Articles/272203/) fixes that.

The window of vulnerability is small, but was observed in SBCL. The
sequence of events that would lead to memory corruption are as follows:

* a user space program does an operation (memmove() for example)
  that sets DF
* a signal occurs for some process
* the kernel calls the signal handler
* the signal handler does a memmove() in what it thinks is a
  forward direction
* the memory is copied in the reverse direction, leading to corruption

It is hard to see how that could be turned into a security breach, but it
would be a mistake to assume that it can't. Other kernel bugs, like the
one that allowed the recent [vmsplice()
exploit](http://lwn.net/Articles/271688/), have looked liked memory corruption, but were found to be more than
that. The DF issue may turn out to be harmless from a security standpoint,
but it should not be assumed.

So, now the question is: what to do about it. It is clear that the kernel
should not leak the DF state to signal handlers, regardless of what GCC
does. It is interesting to note that this behavior is the same (DF is not
cleared on entry to a signal handler) on BSD
kernels, leading some to claim that it is the ABI that is incorrect and
that GCC should revert to its old behavior. Solaris kernels *do*
clear the DF before calling signal handlers. This problem has existed for
15 years; GCC has always emitted code that worked correctly on kernels
that did not follow the ABI, until now.

Part of the problem is that there are an enormous number of installed
kernels that are vulnerable to this problem, but only if GCC 4.3 is
installed. That version of GCC is not, yet, in widespread use, so the
thinking is that GCC should revert its behavior now, before it gets into
distributions. As kernels with the fix become more widespread, the
"proper" behavior could be restored. The GCC folks don't necessarily see
it that way, so it is unclear what will happen.

While it is true that distributors can control what kernel version and GCC
version they ship, those aren't the only ways that either GCC or
GCC-compiled binaries get installed. It is a bit of ticking time bomb for
random memory corruption at a minimum. Handling those bug reports will be
very difficult and time consuming. While the new behavior of GCC is
correct, and the kernel is broken, it would be very helpful to back out
this change, perhaps providing the new behavior via a command-line argument
for those who are sure their binaries will be running on patched kernels. [Some discussion
on the gcc-devel list](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gcc.devel/96870) would indicate that a GCC 4.3.0.1 or 4.3.1 may be
forthcoming.

Er, I think the new behavior can be called "correct" only for a very narrow definition of the term. It's true that the ABI does specify that DF should be cleared, but because it's widely known (or should be) among system-level hackers that many important programs do not honor this part of the ABI, GCC should ensure correct behavior in cases where the callers do not.

Okay, so the Linux and BSD kernels were not properly following this part of the ABI, and that's technically incorrect. But the thing is, the GCC developers *apparently knew that*, and prior to this had fixed it; adherence to standards and specifications is a good thing, but so is not breaking working code. Hopefully they'll revert this change, perhaps with a compile-time warning for the incorrect behavior.

I don't see why they should revert it.  Maybe make a flag to change the default behavior.

But people are going to have to live with it.  Apparantly ICC has been doing this for years
already.  So the problem is already out there on anything ICC has compiled.  Like, say,
commercial versions of MySQL.  Don't those use ICC?  And I think some Linux games were built
with ICC.  And what about Oracle?

I think that having the kernel do the wrong thing and then claiming that GCC has to fix the
problem is just ridiculous.  Especially after all the years of trying to make GCC follow the
ABI standards so that it can interoperate with other compilers and libraries.

Follow the standards, don't make up your own.  That's Microsoft all over, and we open source
types are supposed to hate it.

There's following the standards, and then there's not communicating about a potentially code-breaking change. Because GCC previously was emitting cld instructions before every inlined function call, we can conclude they knew about the problem existing in the wild. They should have given the Linux and BSD developers a heads up about this.

GCC changes every day.  If you are interested in what every change is, you are free to look
at: <http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-cvs/>

This particular change to GCC was made many months ago and underwent extensive testing on many
different platforms.  That this bug existed and was exposed only after 4.3.0 was released is
perhaps unfortunate, but you imply that someone knew about the problem and withheld that
information.  That is not the case.

From the gcc point of view, it was simply a matter of observing that the compiler was emitting an unneeded instruction: we don't have to clear that register because it's already cleared; the standard says so, and real implementations follow the standard correctly (or so it was thought). The result was that code sequences that use the x86 string instructions are slightly smaller and faster with gcc 4.3.0.

The issue of kernels not following the rules in the case of signal handlers was not noticed until the 4.3.0 release process had already started.

If you think that kernel developers should be notified of every change of this kind, just in case it does something, they'd need to subscribe to the svn commit mailing list, and they'd be overwhelmed with messages describing small changes.

this is a case where the history of the code is needed to tell what's really going on.

did older GCC versions add the instruction because some programmer in the past ran into this
bug and fixed it (in which case the changelog for the commit that introduced this would
theoretically be found), or was the original programmer of this function in GCC exercising
defensive programming by not assuming that other programs leave things in any particular state
(which is what was assumed)?

how large and how many clock cycles does this instruction use?

History may not be relevant here. It could be that in the past GCC was simply not able to
track the state of the control bit when generation the code. As such the compiler had to
insert the explicit instructions to reset the bit even if it was known that they were not
necessary from ABI point of view.

the history is very relevant. you are listing a third option (very similar to the second one I
listed above) knowing which of these is correct (or if there is a fourth that is correct) is
significant in evaluating what needs to change.

*The result was that code sequences that use the x86 string instructions are slightly smaller and faster with gcc 4.3.0.*

The eliminated instruction is one byte long, executes very quickly, and string instructions are not very common in most real code anyway. When they occur, they are heavyweight operations, because the sources and count have to be set up into particular registers, and the string instruction itself usually takes much more time than simple instructions. Whether or not the direction flag instruction appears might then change the time of the string operation by perhaps 1% or less. So except for contrived programs that consist almost entirely of these string operations, I suspect it is impossible to measure any execution time reduction in actual programs that could be attributed to this compiler change.

Of course removing a redundant instruction is aesthetically the right thing to do, but in this case I think it does not have practical benefits.

Was in worth the trouble fixing this in the kernel?
Definitely.
The kernel *must* do "*the right thing*",
without regard to any idiocy commited by the programs it is running.
Not doing so might open vulnerabilities.
Was it really worth it in GCC?
Not so sure... but the compiler should enforce the relevant ABIs
(and is also entitled to assume they are being followed).

Unfortunately, you're wrong. CLD can have a latency of 50+ cycles on some x86 implementations:
that's not an insignificant amount. Plus we're not just talking about "string operations",
we're talking about functions like memset() & memcpy() too, which often use them.

See: <http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2008-03/msg00360.html> for some benchmarks
and <http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2008-03/msg00404.html> for a link to a document which gives a
latency of 52 cycles for CLD.

I don't think what people knew and/or concealed is relevant, but the fact that the behavior has existed for 15 years and exists in countless systems today matters a lot. 15 years of practice is a much stronger standard than any prescriptive document. I say *the standard* is that DF's value is undefined at entry to a function, and Gcc 4.3.0 fails to conform.

This is a classic dilemma. You can make Gcc right or you can make it work.

If you offered both versions to the public, very few would opt for the "right" one. That's not the last word, of course. I'm sure some people believe the Gcc project has higher goals than giving its users what they want.

But traditionally, prescriptive standards nearly always bow to what actual practice demands.

Claiming that it's standard "because GCC does it that way" completely ignores all the other

I think you got it backward. I claim it's standard because *Linux* does it that way. Linux is what violates the prescribed standard.

I also didn't state the de facto standard as precisely as I could have, because Linux clearly should change to clear the DF flag. But Gcc should continue to clear it too, because old Linux exists.

This does not buy you anything except slowing down all your code unnecessarily.  Any user
might use a binary built with some other compiler, like the precompiled commercial MySQL
server, or a game.  Software running through Wine is probably built with Visual Studio.  A JIT
like Mono or Java might generate code that doesn't reset DF.  A developer might be using TCC
for ultra-fast compiles.  There is also LLVM: I don't know, but it might not do the DF clear
either.

See what I mean about other compilers?  Do you wish to have every one of them also clear DF on
every function?

    x86: clear DF before calling signal handler

    The Linux kernel currently does not clear the direction flag before
    calling a signal handler, whereas the x86/x86-64 ABI requires that.

    Linux had this behavior/bug forever, but this becomes a real problem
    with gcc version 4.3, which assumes that the direction flag is
    correctly cleared at the entry of a function.

    This patches changes the setup_frame() functions to clear the
    direction before entering the signal handler.

The last time I checked, signal handlers are not in a different process from the one receiving
the signal.  They are run on one of the threads of the process that received the signal.  The
bug is that the state leaks from that specific thread into the signal handler running on the
same thread.

There's no requirement that the current executing process be the one that receives the signal.
For example:

Process 1:
  kill(proc2, SIGHUP);

Process 2:
  signal_handler()

Doing some hand-wavy magic about the scheduler running process 2 immediately when process 1
sends the signal.  Process 1 would have been executing and would get interrupted so that
process 2's signal handler could process the HUP.  If process 1 had changed the DF, it would
"leak" into process 2.

We were arguing about this on the gcc list, and it was unclear to me whether the DF flag could actually leak from one process to another (indicating a true security bug, however minor). If a context switch occurs, wouldn't the kernel restore all of process 2's registers before entering the signal handler?

Can a kernel expert confirm or deny this? (At least, for currently deployed kernels)?

Under ordinary circumstances, the GCC developers would plan an x.y.1 release to occur about two months after an x.y.0 release, for any values of x and y, as a bug-fix-only release. The only real question is whether issues like this one might lead to putting out 4.3.1 sooner.

In any case, this bug has generated far more discussion than any number of other bugs that have more impact. Unless you have a program that invokes an x86 string move instruction from inside a signal handler, the issue isn't going to affect your program.

This problem has nothing to do with building the kernel.  It is in building user space
applications.  So, installing GCC 4.3.0 or a binary built with it on any Linux (or evidently
BSD) kernel released could trigger the problem.  If it does memory/string operations in signal

No, it has nothing to do with calling mem<foo> in a signal handler.
The point is that said functions *may* set the DF flag, and before it is reset a signal may come in. The signal handler then could run with the flag set, expecting it to be unset. A few instructions inspect this flag.

Sure it does.  If the signal handler call was compiled with the new GCC, then it will expect
the flag to be clear on entry.  If the flag happens to be set and the signal handler calls
mem<foo>, the copy will go backward.  This can be exploited.

The main concern is not that someone will *purposefully* write a program that uses this bug to
clobber its own memory, so the fact that someone could have used a non-standard compiler to
achieve this is not relevent.

The real problem is that the new behavior would open up one more way for programmers to

corruption bug that adds up with other bugs in the application itself to result in an exploit.

Reverting gcc-4.3 doesn't help matters.

Now this DF bit flaw is known, then anyone can patch a compiler or use
assembler to attempt to craft an exploit in application code.  The kernel
is broken, it should not rely on called code to clear the flag, but
actually ensure the registers are saved, set & restored according to ABI.

Perhaps kernels compiled with gcc < 4.3, can rely on gcc clearing the flag
when the signal handler is called in a subroutine, in which case it is
reasonable to argue that back-porting a fix to support gcc-4.3 may not be
absolutely necessary.  But it's probably as simple to patch stable kernel
updates with the fix, as it is to detect and warn about a build using 4.3.
It's not admin-friendly to rely on older kernel source not being built
with the latest gcc.

Past experience with "apparently unexploitable" flaws, tends to suggest
that correcting the code is the only safe option.

If you allow anyone to inject code in your executables you are hosed already. And if don't - you can not exploit this bug. Prerequisites are harsh: gcc 4.3-compiled priveleged daemon and kernel below 2.6.25 ...

*Perhaps kernels compiled with gcc < 4.3*

May be it's good idea to read the article? It does not matter if your kernel is compiled with gcc 4.2 or gcc 4.3. The question is about things like login or sshd. **They** must be compiled with gcc 4.3 - only then you can have a problem.

*It's not admin-friendly to rely on older kernel source not being built
with the latest gcc.*

Yup. But that's one and only solution. Why? Kernel pushes gcc to the limit and so kernels always support finite **range** of compilers supported. "GCC version between x.y.z and x1.y1.z1" was (and is) the only supported mode. If you plan to use kernel 2.6.24 compiled with gcc 4.3 then you should plan to reinstall the system shortly afterwards. If was **never** supported, and it will not be supported - to compile the kernel with compiler newer then the kernel is insanity.

*Past experience with "apparently unexploitable" flaws, tends to suggest
that correcting the code is the only safe option.*

Code is already corrected - now the question is about deployment...

No it's not.  Don't think many experienced sysadmins would feel happy
relying on the "privileged daemon compiled with gcc-4.3" as a sound
foundation for security.

Securing systems means multiple layers and not leaving apparently small
flaws and leaving a single point of critical failure.  Then when defense 1
is broken, the next has to be breached to, which buys time when exploits
become known, or some script kiddie has started an attack and found a hole
in some service you offer.

If you're running a web-server for example, you don't give a shell out,
yet your defense only has to fail once, for some web app to permit code to
be run.  If you run a host with multiple users, with shell access then
flipping a register which is meant to be cleared, might cause some
instability and permit an unintentional DoS.

It doesn't matter, that an exploit is not clear, the fact that it is not
absolutely unexploitable, argues for patching the kernel as has been done.
That we agreed on.  My post was not complaining against the kernel, nor
gcc, but argueing the futileness of patching gcc-4.3 to revert to non-ABI
behaviour.

Your assumption that gcc-4.3 or another compiler cannot be built by a
user is wrong, so the logic statement "gcc = 4.3 &  kernel < 2.6.25"
should actually be the simpler "unpatched kernel < 2.6.25".  You may feel,
that is too pessimistic, but I'm afraid in the real world root does make
mistakes, so relying on need for root privilege to install the daemon is
weak security.

If the kernel is compiled, with an older gcc, then it may very well be
clearing the DF bit, for the kernel accidentally, and I suspect that the
reason the kernel wasn't clearing it, was because gcc already did it.
That's creditting the kernel developers for actually testing conformance
to the ABI.

As for older kernels, getting compiled with unsupported compilers,
distro's have done that frequently in the past and also hobbyist types,
may try latest gcc and see if it works.  A subtle issue like this is
exactly the type of thing that falls between the cracks.  I agree that
folk shouldn't do it, but in the real world ppl do build "unsupported"
combinations and as FOSS doesn't come with a legal warranty, your users
aren't seeing much difference between that and the situation with the
correct software versions.

You seem to agree that reverting gcc-4.3 and patching the kernel is the
correct action, and furthermore that "deployment" may be the weak area, so
why be so condescending?

You've got all sorts of misapprehensions about this.

Firstly what you seem to be proposing is that somehow this ABI bug would corrupt the OS
kernel. I can assure you that this cannot happen. Linux* couldn't care two hoots about the DF
bit in the flag register of a userspace process which is all that's being tweaked. However the
process itself might care, and is entitled to ABI correct behaviour - and so Linux needed to
be patched to reset this flag bit when calling the signal handler in the userspace process.

Flipping the DF bit is not a privileged operation, it's a normal function of the x86 processor
family. You can add code to your programs to arbitrarily flip DF if you like, and at most
you'll just manage to make it hang or crash.

To have a security problem, what would be needed is to run privileged code which relies on
this ABI feature, and then send it signals until it malfunctions. In most cases on Linux your
privileged code was compiled with GCC < 4.3 and thus does not rely on this ABI feature. Code
from vendors compiled with a patched GCC 4.3.x will also not be affected. Daemons and other
privileged processes very rarely provide a mechanism to receive signals from unprivileged
users. Most of them do very little in their signal handlers and thus won't be relying on this
ABI feature even with GCC 4.3.0. So you need a very extraordinary set of circumstances to
achieve anything more than crashing your own programs.

The code in which this bug was originally noticed deliberately causes large numbers of
SIGSEGVs during normal operation and handles them by AFAICT calling memmove() from an assembly
language routine. Does that sound like any of the programs running with privileges on your
servers? No, didn't think so.

If you're in the habit of running code created by untrusted users then you don't need this ABI
bug to have problems, indeed it makes no difference at all - you've got a gaping hole in your
security strategy from the start.

* Read NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD etc. for Linux as you prefer. They all seem to have an
identical bug here, shielded by GCC

No I do get that when programs have been compiled with gcc < 4.3 they
clear the bit.  It's just that applications suffering obscure memory
corruption when memory operations go wrong, and a leaking of the bit
between processes on signals, is not something anyone ought to want on a
system.

My point was, that contrary to the comments made early on, reverting GCC
behaviour is not a sane option.  Patching the kernel is.

Don't use gcc 4.3 to compile your programs then. Or patch your kernel. Your choice.

*and a leaking of the bit between processes on signals, is not something anyone ought to want on a system.*

You can only leak bit from program **to the same program**. And if your program does not trust itself - you are hosed anyway.

Once more from the top.

1. Linux, FreeBSD and other kernels provided kind of "changed ABI" - "DF is not guaranteed to be cleared or set when you enter function" was the change from official ABI.

2. GCC before 4.3 produced code which worked correctly with this "changed ABI".

3. GCC 4.3 started to rely on obscure part of ABI and this led to crashes (in some obscure programs but that's not the point).

4. Kernel 2.6.25 fixed problem and now it's safe to use GCC 4.3.

But it **does not** mean anything for GCC 4.2 and kernel 2.6.24! They have used incorrect ABI all along - but they used it **correctly and consistently**. Yes, from formal POV kernel is wrong and GCC is right, but in reality you can fix either GCC **or** kernel - it does not matter which: GCC 4.2 + kernel 2.6.24 is 100% secure and internally consistent combination, GCC 4.3 + kernel 2.6.25 is 100% secure and internally consistent combination (as far as this bug is concerned, of course).

Just a clarification on the discovery history:
"found when building Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) using the new compiler" is not exactly
correct.  The problem was found when building SBCL, which doesn't use gcc, but which does use
libc6.  There was a change in Debian unstable that introduced a new version of libc6 2.7-8 ->

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Linux kernel on the SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 Service Pack 1 line
of products was updated to fix quite a number of security problems:
CVE-2007-6282: A remote attacker could crash the IPSec/IPv6 stack
by sending a bad ESP packet. This requires the host to be able to
receive such packets (default filtered by the firewall).
CVE-2008-2136: A problem in SIT IPv6 tunnel handling could be used
by remote attackers to immediately crash the machine.
CVE-2008-1615: On x86\_64 a denial of service attack could be used by
local attackers to immediately panic / crash the machine.
CVE-2007-6206: An information leakage during core dumping of root
processes was fixed.
CVE-2008-1669: Fixed a SMP ordering problem in fcntl\_setlk could
potentially allow local attackers to execute code by timing file
locking.
CVE-2008-1375: Fixed a dnotify race condition, which could be used
by local attackers to potentially execute code.
CVE-2007-5500: A ptrace bug could be used by local attackers to hang
their own processes indefinitely.
CVE-2008-1367: Clear the "direction" flag before calling signal
handlers. For specific not yet identified programs under specific
timing conditions this could potentially have caused memory corruption
or code execution.
CVE-2007-6151: The isdn\_ioctl function in isdn\_common.c allowed local
users to cause a denial of service via a crafted ioctl struct in
which ioctls is not null terminated, which triggers a buffer overflow.
Non security related changes:
OCFS2 was updated to version v1.2.9-1-r3100.
Also a huge number of bugs were fixed. Please refer to the RPM
changelog for a detailed list.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the updated packages.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=437312#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-03-13 15:03:34 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Jake Edge has reported the following gcc kernel related potential security issue on LWN:  <cite>  A change to GCC for a recent release coupled with a kernel bug has created a messy situation, with possible security implications. GCC changed some assumptions about x86 processor flags, in accordance with the ABI standard, that can lead to memory corruption for programs built with GCC 4.3.0. No one has come up with a way to exploit the flaw, at least yet, but it clearly is a problem that needs to be addressed.  The problem revolves around the x86 direction flag (DF), which governs whether block memory operations operate forward through memory or backwards. The main use for the flag is to support overlapping memory copies, where working backwards through memory may be required so that the data being copied does not get overwritten as the copy progresses. Debian hacker Aurélien Jarno reported the problem to linux-kernel on March 5th, which was found when building Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) using the new compiler.  GCC's most recent release, 4.3.0, assumes that the direction flag has been cleared (i.e. memory operations go in a forward direction) at the entry of each function, as is specified by the ABI (which is, somewhat amusingly, found at sco.com [PDF]). Unfortunately, this clashes with Linux signal handlers, which get called, incorrectly, with the flag in whatever state it was in when the signal occurred. This has the effect of leaking one bit of state from the user space process that was running when the signal occurred to the signal handler, which could be in another process.  That, in itself, is a bug, seemingly with fairly minimal impact. Prior to 4.3, GCC would emit a cld (clear direction flag) opcode before doing inline string or memory operations, so those operations would start from a known state. In 4.3, GCC relies on the ABI mandate that the direction flag is cleared before entry to a function, which means that the kernel needs to arrange that before calling a signal handler. It currently doesn't, but a small patch fixes that.  The window of vulnerability is small, but was observed in SBCL. The sequence of events that would lead to memory corruption are as follows:      * a user space program does an operation (memmove() for example) that       sets DF     * a signal occurs for some process     * the kernel calls the signal handler     * the signal handler does a memmove() in what it thinks is a forward         direction     * the memory is copied in the reverse direction, leading to corruption  </cite>  Link to the post:  <http://lwn.net/Articles/272048/#Comments>  Link to upstream fix:  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git;a=commitdiff;h=52c841e1012b8e73cc04b53f92fb933db580fb42>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=437312#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-03-13 15:04:37 UTC  ``` Additional comment from [BZ#436131](show_bug.cgi?id=436131 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-1367 [RHEL5] Kernel doesn't clear DF for signal handlers"):  The debian folks reported that kernel doesn't ensure direction flag is cleared upon entry to signal handler, which violates both i?86 and x86_64 ABIs. Old GCCs conservatively used cld anyway before using any instructions that use that flag, but GCC 4.3 no longer does that, it relies on the ABI guarantees that on entry to a function the direction flag must be cleared. See <http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2006-12/msg00276.html> Anything that uses std instruction must cld again before calling another function or before returning from function. Unfortunately, if async signal is sent while a thread has std flag set, kernel will start a signal handler with DF flag set.  The fix is addition of regs->eflags &= ~X86_EFLAGS_DF; or similar in setup_frame/setup_rt_frame (i386, x86_64, x86_64 32-bit support).  While only code compiled with GCC 4.3 and later will be affected by this bug, RHEL5 kernels are often used with later Fedora userland (e.g. koji buildboxes), so IMHO if at all possible to fix should be backported to RHEL5.2 and perhaps even RHEL4.7 kernels.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=437312#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-03-13 15:05:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 297943](attachment.cgi?id=297943 "Testcase for finding out the value of the DF flag.")

Testcase for finding out the value of the DF flag.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=437312#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-03-13 15:08:38 UTC  ``` Comments from Jason Baron and reply from Jakub Jelinek describing the  current behaviour and the nature of the bug:  <cite jbaron>  Whenever i run the test case (sending SIGUSR1 to the test process), i get: 'DF = 1'. indicating that the the df flag is set...I expected it to be unset b/c from reading this gcc clears the df flags...i've tried older distros and compat-gcc and still i get DF = 1...what am i missing? thanks.  </cite>  <cite jakub>  If you get DF = 1, then that means the kernel is buggy.  The psABI says that the DF flag must be clear upon entry to a function and also on exit from function.  GCC <= 4.2.x would add cld just in case, whenever it used some string instruction (movs*/stos*/loads*/cmps* etc.), GCC 4.3.0 relies on the ABI guarantee.  As GCC itself never issues std insn, it is just inline or out-of-line assembly which has to reset cld after it did std (AFAIK all such assembly I saw does that), the kernel has to start a process with cleared DF flag (also done) and the kernel signal handler needs to clear it for the signal handler (this is the bug).  </cite>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=437312#c9)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-03-13 15:55:40 UTC  ``` Valid link to upstream kernel commit:  <http://marc.info/?l=git-commits-head&m=120492000901739&w=2>  And the following one:  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=e40cd10ccff3d9fbffd57b93780bee4b7b9bff51>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=437312#c10)  Joshua Giles    2008-04-28 18:33:10 UTC  ``` Hi Jan,  Can you post the rhel3 committed patch for clarification?
