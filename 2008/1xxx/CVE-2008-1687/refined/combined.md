M4 performs macro expansion without any special characters present,
IIRC.  However, it's still unlikely that an mkstemp()-returned string
matches a macro, I think.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This does not sound like a security problem. Mkstemp would never output
any shell metacharacters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

Subject: Security fixes in m4-1.4.11

Hello all,

GNU m4-1.4.11 was released on 2008-04-02.  While browsing the ChangeLog
(and then NEWS) I noticed these security related items.  I'm not sure
how severe the impact is of these issues, but since I have not seen them
mentioned on any security lists yet a heads-up seemed to be in order.

 From the ChangeLog:

Minor security fix: Quote output of mkstemp.
* src/builtin.c (mkstemp_helper): Produce quoted output.
* doc/m4.texinfo (Mkstemp): Update the documentation and tests.
* NEWS: Document this change.

Security fix: avoid arbitrary code execution with 'm4 -F'.
* src/freeze.c (produce_frozen_state): Never pass raw file name
as printf format.
* NEWS: Document this fix.

 From the NEWS file:

** Security fixes for the -F option, for bugs present since -F was
introduced in 1.3: Avoid core dump with 'm4 -F file -t undefined', and
avoid arbitrary code execution with certain file names.

** The output of the `maketemp' and `mkstemp' builtins is now quoted if
a file was created. This is a minor security fix, because it was
possible (although rather unlikely) that an unquoted string could match
an existing macro name, such that use of the `mkstemp' output would
trigger inadvertent macro expansion and operate on the wrong file name.

Cheers,

Pat

```

More details about the issues may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1687   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1688   Here are the details from the Slackware 12.0 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/m4-1.4.11-i486-1_slack12.0.tgz:  Upgraded to m4-1.4.11.   In addition to bugfixes and enhancements, this version of m4 also fixes two   issues with possible security implications.  A minor security fix with the   use of "maketemp" and "mkstemp" -- these are now quoted to prevent the   (rather unlikely) possibility that an unquoted string could match an   existing macro causing operations to be done on the wrong file.  Also,   a problem with the '-F' option (introduced with version 1.4) could cause a   core dump or possibly (with certain file names) the execution of arbitrary   code.
