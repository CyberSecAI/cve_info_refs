Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2008-1836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A buffer over-read exists in the `rfc2231()` function within ClamAV. This occurs when the function produces a string that is not null-terminated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Over-read:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer over-read. Because the output is not null-terminated, a reading process expecting a null-terminated string may continue reading beyond the intended buffer boundary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact of this specific vulnerability is not explicitly stated to lead to remote code execution but it is grouped with other vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution. However the text specifically refers to a "buffer over-read" which could lead to a denial of service or other undefined behavior by reading beyond memory boundaries.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves scanning a specially crafted file. An attacker could send a malicious file to a system that uses ClamAV to scan files (such as email gateways).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted file to a system running a vulnerable version of ClamAV. This could be through email, file uploads, or other means.

**Additional Notes**
* The content provided contains additional vulnerabilities associated with ClamAV (CVE-2008-0314, CVE-2008-1100, CVE-2008-1387, CVE-2008-1833, CVE-2008-1835, CVE-2008-1837).
* Multiple sources highlight the need to update ClamAV to version 0.93 to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
* Some sources also mention that the database change during the update process might require manual verification to make sure the clamd daemon restarted successfully.
* The openSUSE mailing list message provides a comprehensive description of the vulnerabilities as well as the necessary steps to fix it, which include downloading the correct update packages based on the system architecture.
