##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

Alin Rad Pop discovered an array index vulnerability in the SDP

parser. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

malicious RTSP stream, a remote attacker may be able to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2008-0073](/security/CVE-2008-0073))

Luigi Auriemma discovered that xine-lib did not properly check

buffer sizes in the RTSP header-handling code. If xine-lib opened an

RTSP stream with crafted SDP attributes, a remote attacker may be

able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-0225](/security/CVE-2008-0225), [CVE-2008-0238](/security/CVE-2008-0238))

Damian Frizza and Alfredo Ortega discovered that xine-lib did not

properly validate FLAC tags. If a user or automated system were

tricked into opening a crafted FLAC file, a remote attacker may be

able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-0486](/security/CVE-2008-0486))

It was discovered that the ASF demuxer in xine-lib did not properly

check the length if the ASF header. If a user or automated system

were tricked into opening a crafted ASF file, a remote attacker

could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1110](/security/CVE-2008-1110))

It was discovered that the Matroska demuxer in xine-lib did not

properly verify frame sizes. If xine-lib opened a crafted ASF file,

a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2008-1161](/security/CVE-2008-1161))

Luigi Auriemma discovered multiple integer overflows in xine-lib. If

a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted FLV,

MOV, RM, MVE, MKV or CAK file, a remote attacker may be able to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2008-1482](/security/CVE-2008-1482))

It was discovered that xine-lib did not properly validate its input

when processing Speex file headers. If a user or automated system

were tricked into opening a specially crafted Speex file, an

attacker could create a denial of service or possibly execute

arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1686](/security/CVE-2008-1686))

Guido Landi discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in xine-lib

when processing NSF files. If xine-lib opened a specially crafted

NSF file with a long NSF title, an attacker could create a denial of

service or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2008-1878](/security/CVE-2008-1878))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# xine-lib: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200808-01**

xine-lib is vulnerable to multiple buffer overflows when processing media
streams.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/xine-lib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.13** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.13** |

### Background

xine-lib is the core library package for the xine media player, and
other players such as Amarok, Codeine/Dragon Player and Kaffeine.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in xine-lib:

* Alin Rad Pop of Secunia reported an array indexing vulnerability in the
  sdpplin\_parse() function in the file input/libreal/sdpplin.c when
  processing streams from RTSP servers that contain a large "streamid"
  SDP parameter (CVE-2008-0073).
* Luigi Auriemma reported multiple integer overflows that result in
  heap-based buffer overflows when processing ".FLV", ".MOV" ".RM",
  ".MVE", ".MKV", and ".CAK" files (CVE-2008-1482).
* Guido Landi reported a stack-based buffer overflow in the
  demux\_nsf\_send\_chunk() function when handling titles within NES Music
  (.NSF) files (CVE-2008-1878).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to play a specially crafted video
file or stream with a player using xine-lib, potentially resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the player.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.13"
```

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- xine NSF buffer overflow
Specially crafted NSF files could potentially be exploited to
execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-1878).
Specially crafted files or streams could potentially be abused to
trick applications that support speex into executing arbitrary code
(CVE-2008-1686).
Updated packages have been released for all SUSE distributions
containing XINE.
- xemacs and emacs fast-lock file problems
Emacs and Xemacs automatically loaded fast-lock files which allowed
local attackers to execute arbitrary code as the user editing the
associated files (CVE-2008-2142).
Xemacs and Emacs have been updated on all SUSE distributions.
- opensuse-updater tmp problems and off-by-one problems
The opensuse-updater on openSUSE 10.2 was updated to fix a symlink
problem and two off-by-one vulnerabilities.
The overflows can be considered no security problem and are tracked
by CVE-2008-2388.
The symlink flaw could be used by local users to gain unauthorized
access to information (like passwords) and is tracked by
CVE-2008-2389.
Only openSUSE 10.2 was affected by this problem.
- libvorbis security problems
Several security problems were fixed in libvorbis:
CVE-2008-1419 - Division by zero
CVE-2008-1420 - integer overflow
CVE-2008-1423 - integer overflow
libvorbis was updated on all SUSE distributions.
- xine sdpplin\_parse overflow
Xine was updated to fix a bug in the function sdpplin\_parse()
that allowed remote attackers to access process memory out-of a
buffers bound.
This vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary code remotely
if successfully exploited. (CVE-2008-0073)
Xine was updated on all SUSE distributions.
- vorbis-tools speex code execution problem
Specially crafted files or streams could potentially be abused to
trick applications that support speex into executing arbitrary code
(CVE-2008-1686) using vorbis-tools.
vorbis-tools was fixed on all SUSE distributions.
- pdns-recursor spoofing problems
Pdns-recursor was prone to a spoofing vulnerability which could be
abused to redirect clients or manipulate data. (CVE-2008-1637)
pdns / pdns-recursor is shipped on SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2
and 10.3 and was fixed there.
- openwsman post-auth remote code execution
Openwsman was updated to provide a fix for the included shttpd
web-server to patch a buffer overflow vulnerability in the HTTP
request parser.
This bug can only be exploited by authenticated users to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the openwsman/shttp
daemon. (CVE-2008-2097)
Only openSUSE 10.3 contains openwsman and was fixed.

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- Linux kernel update
We are currently preparing a kernel update for all products to catch up on security
problems and bugs found in the last months.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

Package        : xine-lib
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1482 CVE-2008-1686 CVE-2008-1878

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in xine-lib, a library
which supplies most of the application functionality of the xine
multimedia player.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following three problems:

CVE-2008-1482

    Integer overflow vulnerabilities exist in xine's FLV, QuickTime,
    RealMedia, MVE and CAK demuxers, as well as the EBML parser used
    by the Matroska demuxer.  These weaknesses allow an attacker to
    overflow heap buffers and potentially execute arbitrary code by
    supplying a maliciously crafted file of those types.

CVE-2008-1686

    Insufficient input validation in the Speex implementation used
    by this version of xine enables an invalid array access and the
    execution of arbitrary code by supplying a maliciously crafted
    Speex file.

CVE-2008-1878

    Inadequate bounds checking in the NES Sound Format (NSF) demuxer
    enables a stack buffer overflow and the execution of arbitrary
    code through a maliciously crafted NSF file.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.12-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your xine-lib packages.
