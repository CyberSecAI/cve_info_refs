      "content": "iScripts Socialware is vulnerable to SQL injection. The vulnerability exists in the `events.php` script due to insufficient sanitization of the `id` parameter when processing the `show` action. An attacker can exploit this by injecting arbitrary SQL queries into the `id` parameter. This allows them to extract sensitive data like usernames, passwords, and email addresses from the `admin_users` and `members` tables. Additionally, the application does not check file extensions when uploading a new logo using the admin interface. This enables attackers to upload a PHP shell after logging in with credentials obtained through the SQL injection.",
