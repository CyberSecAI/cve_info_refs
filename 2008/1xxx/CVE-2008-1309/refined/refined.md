      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a heap corruption error in the 'rmoc3260.dll' ActiveX control when processing the 'Console' property.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap corruption",
        "ActiveX control vulnerability"

        "additional_details":"The exploit uses JavaScript to manipulate the ActiveX control's Console property with a crafted string, triggering the heap corruption and executing shellcode. The exploit includes shellcode examples for both 'win32_exec' (to execute calc.exe) and 'win32_bind' (to open a listening port)."
