How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Check Point VPN-1 information disclosure vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#992585

Original Release Date: 2008-03-18 | Last Revised: 2008-03-18

---

### Overview

The Check Point VPN-1 firewall contains an information disclosure vulnerability that may allow an authenticated attacker to access data that they are not authorized to access.

### Description

| The Check Point VPN-1 is an application layer firewall that supports remote and site-to-site virtual private networks (VPN).  From Check Point Solution ID [sk34579](https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&solutionid=sk34579&js_peid=P-114a7ba5fd7-10001&partition=null&product=VPN-1)*This issue occurs in the following scenario:Remote Access Client (C) connects to a gateway (A). A site-to-site VPN tunnel exists between gateways (A) and (B). If the Remote Access Client (C) has an IP address which is also defined in the encryption domain of gateway (B), collisions occur: new connections meant for the afore-mentioned IP address in the encryption domain of gateway (B) would be incorrectly transferred to the Remote Access Client (C). Existing connections are not affected.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, authenticated attacker may be able to intercept data that they are not authorized to access. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  Check Point has released an update to address this vulnerability. Administrators should see Check Point Solution ID [sk34579](https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&solutionid=sk34579&js_peid=P-114a7ba5fd7-10001&partition=null&product=VPN-1) for information about how to obtain fixed software. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access to internal network applications**Using application based access controls and encryption will mitigate this vulnerability by preventing a remote attacker from decrypting or accessing any data received from exploiting this vulnerability. |
