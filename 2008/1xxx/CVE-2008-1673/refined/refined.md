{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2008-1673",
    "description": "The ASN.1 decode code used by the SNMP NAT and CIFS subsystem in the Linux kernel has a potential heap overflow. It does not properly validate length values during the decoding of ASN.1 BER data. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "root_cause": "Improper validation of length values during ASN.1 BER data decoding.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap Overflow",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution or denial of service (crash)",
     "attack_vector": "Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted packets to the affected subsystem.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to send network packets that reach the vulnerable code path in the kernel, specifically those using the CIFS or SNMP NAT subsystems.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Linux Kernel",
       "CIFS subsystem",
       "SNMP NAT subsystem"
    ]
