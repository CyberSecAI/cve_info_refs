How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1550-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
April 17, 2008                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : suphp
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1614
Debian Bug     : 475431

It was discovered that suphp, an Apache module to run PHP scripts with
owner permissions handles symlinks insecurely, which may lead to
privilege escalation by local users.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.2-1+etch0.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your suphp packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 4.0 (stable)
- -------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc and s390.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=439687#c0)  Felix Schwarz    2008-03-30 14:21:26 UTC  ``` Upstream found two local privilege escalation problems which include the use of symlink. in mod_suphp 0.6.2. Fixes for these bugs are included in 0.6.3. Upstream recommends an immediate update for all users.  Short upstream report: <http://www.suphp.org/Home.html> Detailed report: <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.php.suphp.general/348>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=439687#c1)  Felix Schwarz    2008-03-30 20:04:53 UTC  ``` Unfortunately, I don't know any public version control system for mod_suphp. This means it is quite hard to isolate the code fixing the described problems. For Fedora we can just update to 0.6.3 but EPEL should get a backport.  Therefore I examined the releases 0.6.2 and 0.6.3 for changes ('diff --recursive -u --exclude="aclocal*" --exclude="config*" --exclude="Makefile*" --exclude=ChangeLog --exclude=INSTALL  suphp-0.6.2 suphp-0.6.3 > diff.patch'). The resulting diff is ~11 kB big but it seems to me that the only source code changes since 0.6.2 were the mentioned fixes for the upstream problems. (I won't attach the diff here as it is easy to recreate.)  Therefore I don't see a point backporting the fixes (and risk not fixing the problems correctly).      ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=439687#c2)  Wouter de Jong    2008-03-31 09:57:25 UTC  ``` <https://ssl.marsching.biz/subversion/suphp/> However, there's no interface available AFAIK like trac or viewsvn.  I'd really like to see a fast fix for this problem, especially for Fedora 7 + 8.  You're right about 0.6.2 vs. 0.6.3 : the only change is this fix, and some  automake fixes.  I'll attach the diff anyway.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=439687#c3)  Wouter de Jong    2008-03-31 09:58:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 299694](attachment.cgi?id=299694&action=diff "Fixes symlink checks") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=299694&action=edit "Fixes symlink checks") Fixes symlink checks   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=439687#c4)  Fedora Update System    2008-03-31 18:55:02 UTC  ``` mod_suphp-0.6.3-1.fc7 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 7   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=439687#c5)  Fedora Update System    2008-03-31 18:55:27 UTC  ``` mod_suphp-0.6.3-1.fc8 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 8   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=439687#c6)  Fedora Update System    2008-04-01 21:32:34 UTC  ``` mod_suphp-0.6.3-1.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=439687#c7)  Fedora Update System    2008-04-01 21:37:23 UTC  ``` mod_suphp-0.6.3-1.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
