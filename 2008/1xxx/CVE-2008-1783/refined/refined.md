{
  "CVE-2008-1783": {
    "Description": "Prozilla Reviews script suffers from bad session handling, and some crucial parts of the admin area are not checked to see if the user is a admin or not. The below url will delete a user from the database.",
    "Root cause": "Bad session handling and lack of admin authorization checks in the admin area.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient session handling",
      "Missing admin authorization checks"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary user deletion from the database.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Direct access to the vulnerable URL"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to know or guess the UserID to be deleted.",
     "Additional Information": "A Perl script example is provided, showing how to iterate through user IDs and delete all users. The vulnerability is located in the `DeleteUser.php` script within the `siteadmin` directory. The lack of access control allows any user to delete user accounts, not only administrators."
