Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1162:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `albumID` parameter in the `album.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection.  The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of input sanitization:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `albumID` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** Successful exploitation can potentially lead to further malicious activities, such as data manipulation or remote command execution if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script, `album.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic understanding of SQL:** The attacker should be able to construct SQL queries.

**Technical Details**
The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability:
```
album.php?slideshow=start&albumID=-4214/**/union/**/select/**/0,username,password,3,4,5,6,7,8/**/from/**/users
```
This PoC uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract usernames and passwords from the `users` table by injecting SQL into the vulnerable `albumID` parameter.
