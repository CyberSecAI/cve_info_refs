Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-1628:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `audit_log_user_command()` function within the `lib/audit_logging.c` file of Linux Audit. This occurs when processing overly long command arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Linux Audit. This could lead to complete system compromise if the audit daemon runs with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Attack: The attacker must have the ability to execute commands on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A local user account on the system where the vulnerable Linux Audit version is running. The attacker needs to be able to execute commands that will be logged by the audit system.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200807-14) provides more detail than the initial CVE description regarding the vulnerable function and the nature of the vulnerability. It also specifies the affected package (`sys-process/audit`) and versions.
- The openSUSE Security Summary Report (SUSE-SR:2008:010) also references CVE-2008-1628 and states that "A bug in the audit_log_user_command() function could lead to a buffer overflow." and that "No program in openSUSE uses that function. Third party applications could be affected though."
- The Red Hat changelog for the audit package includes a fix that adds the exe field to audit_log_user_command in libaudit, suggesting a potential link or fix.
- The gentoo bug report ([https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21570](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21570)) describes an issue with unescaped variables related to the source path which might be related.
- The Gentoo security advisory explicitly states that a stack-based buffer overflow exists in the audit_log_user_command function.
