- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `tss` binary performs insufficient permission checks, allowing local users to read arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper privilege handling and lack of file access verification. Specifically, it doesn't drop privileges before opening files or use `stat()` to check if the caller has permission to view the file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user can read sensitive system files, such as `/etc/shadow`, potentially leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** A local user executes the `tss` binary with the `-a` option followed by the path to the file they wish to read. For example `tss -a /etc/shadow`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a local user with the ability to execute the `tss` binary.
