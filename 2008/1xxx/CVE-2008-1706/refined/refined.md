Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-1706:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

The provided content indicates multiple vulnerabilities within the IBM solidDB product, including:

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** A logging function is vulnerable to format string attacks.
*   **Arbitrary Array Index Crash:** The server uses a client-provided 32-bit number as an array index, without proper bounds checking.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** A specific type of packet can trigger a NULL pointer dereference.
*   **Allocation Error Server Termination:** Malformed packets can cause the server to terminate due to a memory allocation error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** Allows arbitrary code execution or information disclosure due to improper handling of format specifiers in log messages.
*   **Missing Array Bounds Check:** The server does not validate the client provided array index.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:**  A NULL pointer is dereferenced when handling a specific packet leading to a crash.
*  **Lack of proper validation and resource handling**: Malformed packets lead to out-of-memory and crash the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Format String:** Could lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure or denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Array Index:** Results in a server crash and denial of service.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** Leads to a server crash and denial of service.
*   **Allocation Error:** Causes the server to terminate.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Format String:** Exploited using a malformed user or peer name when logging.
*   **Arbitrary Array Index:** Exploited by sending a large 32-bit number as an array index to the server.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** Exploited by sending a specific type of crafted packet.
*  **Allocation Error**: Exploited by sending a malformed packet which leads to a memory allocation error.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the solidDB server. This implies network access to the service.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerabilities are present in IBM solidDB versions <= 06.00.1018 on Windows (tested), Solaris, AIX, HP-UX and Linux platforms.
*   The original advisory suggests remote exploitation is possible.
*   The provided content also links to a proof of concept code.
*   No fix was available at the time of the report.
