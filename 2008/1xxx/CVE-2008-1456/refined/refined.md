{
  "CVE-2008-1456": {
    "Root cause": "The Microsoft Windows Event System does not correctly validate the range of indexes when calling an array of function pointers.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of index range when accessing an array of function pointers."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
    "Attack vectors": "An authenticated attacker would need to call the Microsoft Windows Event System and supply a specifically crafted request beyond the bounds of the array.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be authenticated to the system. They also need to be able to send a specifically crafted request to the Event System service which triggers the vulnerability by accessing the array of function pointers with an out of bounds index. Finding a pointer to a predictable location relative to the array would then allow code to run with elevated privileges."
