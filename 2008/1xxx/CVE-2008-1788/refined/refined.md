Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1788

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an insecure MySQL query within the Entertainment Directory version 1.1 application. Specifically, user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information, specifically user credentials (usernames and passwords) stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to `directory.php` by manipulating the `cat` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, requiring no prior access to the system.
- **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker should have knowledge of SQL to craft the injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` SQL injection technique to extract the `username` and `password` fields from the `users` table within the database. The malicious payload `http://site.com/directory.php?cat=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,3,4,5,6,7,CONCAT(username,char(58),password),9,10,11,12,13,14/**/FROM/**/users/*` demonstrates this.
- The `cat` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection which uses `UNION ALL SELECT` to extract the `username` and `password` from the database.

**Additional Information:**

- The Exploit-DB entry provides the download link for the vulnerable script and indicates that the vendor had not been notified at the time of discovery.
