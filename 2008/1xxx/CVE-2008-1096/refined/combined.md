# USN-681-1: ImageMagick vulnerability

1 December 2008

ImageMagick vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [imagemagick](/security/cves?package=imagemagick) -

## Details

It was discovered that ImageMagick did not correctly handle certain

malformed XCF images. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted image with an application that uses ImageMagick, an attacker

could cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code with

the user's privileges.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [imagemagick](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/imagemagick)
  -
  [7:6.2.4.5.dfsg1-2ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/imagemagick/7%3A6.2.4.5.dfsg1-2ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [imagemagick](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/imagemagick)
  -
  [6:6.2.4.5-0.6ubuntu0.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/imagemagick/6%3A6.2.4.5-0.6ubuntu0.8)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any applications that

use ImageMagick, such as OpenOffice.org and Inkscape, to effect the

necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=414370;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: graphicsmagick
Version: 1.1.7-12
Severity: normal

I found still a couple of PICT files that crash gm with all the
patches I've seen applied (hence unless I missed some they should be
unfixed in 1.1.7-13 too).

Attached files and their behavior on amd64:

broken.pict:
  gm identify does not crash, gm convert segfaults. Looks like a null
  pointer dereference.

broken2.pict:
  gm identify, gm convert both segfault. memcpy() to an out-of-bounds
  address.

broken3.pict:
  gm identify segfaults, gm convert aborts with glibc detected heap
  corruption. Looks like a heap buffer overflow.

I confirm I have all these bugs with graphicsmagick 1.1.7-13, with the
exception of this one:

which exits with the error "Improper image header".

I'm aware that -13 didn't fix all outstanding problems, but wanted to
have a first batch of fixes in etch in time for the release. I'll deal
with the rest as time permits, but please don't let this stop you from
filing new bug reports. Not sure how much time I can set aside for it in
the next days, though.

Regards,

Daniel.

Hmm, ok. Perhaps some of these bugs (or at least the equivalent
#412945 which contains some of the same problems that were severity
grave on graphicsmagick but for imagemagick) should be severity grave
so the release manager will have to explicitly decide to etch-ignore
if he decides to release with known security issues? Not that I doubt
the ability of the RM or the security team to keep track of these,
just trying to prevent mistakes :) But I'll leave all the severity
setting to you, I'm hesitant to interfere since I'm not (yet?) a DD.

I agree that some of the outstanding problems for imagemagick are of
grave severity, but I'll leave it to Luciano -- who's handling the
issues -- to adjust the bug reports as he prefers. That side, security
problems are only rarely considered release blockers as we have a
security infrastructure in place that can rapidly deploy updates after
the release date. (Of course, it puts extra load on the stable security
team, so I hope we can get the fixes into etch before the release,
still.)

Regards,

Daniel.

This one looks the most severe and is likely to have security impact.
Unfortunately, I couldn't reproduce it on i386 with either -O0, or -O2,
which makes debugging even harder. Can you please check whether you can
still trigger a double free with the attached patch applied? I know it
fixes the first testcase you provided, but I'm uncertain if there are
more problems hiding than the obvious one I've fixed. I don't see
corruption with your segv2.viff testcase.

Thanks,

Daniel.

I disagree about the severity. The code history of graphicksmagick/
imagemagick makes it fairly obvious that they are both unsuitable
for processing images from untrusted sources. An afternoon of fuzzing
will most likely reveal another dozen ways to potentially trigger code
injection.
It might be a good idea to document this more clearly, if this isn't
done yet.

Cheers,
        Moritz

I agree that the magicks have quite a dreadful security record, and a
glance at the code reinforces the impression. But even if we put up a
big warning sign for uses of *magicks command line utilities, the same
code paths are still touch in a number of different ways that are not
immediately obvious to the end user: Each reverse dependency of
libmagick9, libgraphicsmagick1, and perlmagick, rubymagick etc. is
affected as well, and I don't expect users to think graphicsmagick when
they start krita, or imagemagick when they run inkscape or ikiwiki. For
some of the more esoteric image formats, they're also the sole providers
of mime handlers. This makes me worried about the bugs that might allow
code injection, but ultimately it's your (the security team's) call, so
I'm lowering the severity as suggested.

I'm not aware of a more secure replacement that offers a set of features
comparable to *magick, unfortunately.

I can try to do that, but for the libraries and language bindings, it's
not obvious to me where to put that warning.

Regards,

Daniel.

The viff_pixels array can be overflown because of insufficient
validation of the number_data_bands value in the input file. Might be
exploitable.

> $ gm identify samples/segv2.viff
> *** glibc detected *** double free or corruption (fasttop): 0x0000000000533970 ***

Two issues here: The above error message is caused by a bug in
MagickReallocMemory(). When called with a size argument of 0, it calls
realloc(memory, 0), then free(memory), but--at least with the standard
glibc allocator--realloc() has already freed the memory internally.
Probably not a grave security problem in the end, but I haven't checked
all code paths. Still a nuisance as the application usually hangs after
the error message (due to what is said to be a glibc bug) until kill
-9'ed.

Trying to hunt down the above, I noticed a more severe problem, though.
In GrayscalePseudoClassImage(), the colormap_index array is an array of
int *. It is allocated as (number of items)*sizeof(int) instead of
sizeof(int *), leaving the array half the required size on 64bit archs.
This bug didn't cause the eventual crash, but looks like a security
problem and might be exploitable.

I'm currently preparing an upload fixing the three problems above, as
well as the outstanding XWD bug #417862.

Regards,

Daniel.

Are you referring to #414370, or rather of the bugs cloned from it?
#414370 is the catch-all for the less severe flaws Sami's testcases
uncovered. It's severity normal, not tagged security and has never been
marked as pending, as far as I can tell. (Incidentially, it's fixed in a
new upstream version released a couple of days ago which I haven't
gotten around to upload so far.)

Daniel.

Which one? I might be looking at the wrong set of bugs, but I haven't
found pending tags on them either. Can you please clarify?

Daniel.

Misunderstanding, we track the summary bug on:
<http://security-tracker.debian.net/tracker/CVE-2008-1096>

and in the bugreport I saw the adding of the pending tags
without noticing that those are the clones which are fixed.

Cheers
Nico

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- sudo not flushing stdin
This update of sudo flushes the stdin buffer on password
timeout. Unflushed buffers can lead to leaking the password via a
parent process reading stdin after sudo exits.
This issue only affects openSUSE 10.3 and was fixed there.
- courier-authlib SQL injection possibility
courier-authlib was updated to fix a bug that allowed SQL
injections. (CVE-2008-2667)
Only openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0 were affected.
- gnome-screensaver
Using gnome-screensaver an attacker could log in without a valid
password if the NIS server is down. (CVE-2008-0887)
gnome-screensaver was affected on SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE
Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and was fixed there.
- clamav 0.93.1
Clamav was updated to version 0.93.1. It fixes various bugs and
one minor security issue:
CVE-2008-2713: libclamav/petite.c in ClamAV before 0.93.1 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted Petite
file that triggers an out-of-bounds read.
clamav was updated on all products containing clamav.
- PHP 5 security update
php5 was updated to fix various bugs and security problems:
- possible stack-based buffer overflow CVE-2008-2050
- incomplete escapeshellcmd() CVE-2008-2051
- printf() integer overflow CVE-2008-1384
- insecure GENERATE\_SEED macro CVE-2008-2107
- timezone update for DST in Pakistan
On openSUSE 10.2 up to 11.0 php5 was updated to 5.2.6. For SUSE
Linux Enterprise 10 SP1 and SP2 the fixes were backported.
- ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick security problems
ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick were affected by two security problems:
CVE-2008-1096: Buffer overflow in the handling of XCF files
CVE-2008-1097: Heap buffer overflow in the handling of PCX files
ImageMagick was updated on all products. GraphicsMagick is only
found on openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0 and was updated there.
- mtr potential remote overflow
MTR was updated to fix a stack based buffer overflow which could
potentially be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2008-2357).
mtr was updated on all SUSE Linux based products.
- bind root zone update
The IP number for the "L" root DNS server changed.
This patch updates the root.hint zone file to get the new IP number.
This is only security related and not a true vulnerability since the
old server is still operating correctly.
- pcre buffer overflow
Specially crafted regular expressions could lead to a buffer overflow
in the pcre library. Applications using pcre to process regular
expressions from untrusted sources could therefore potentially be
exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-2371).
Only the pcre version on openSUSE 10.3 was affected by this problem
and received fixed packages.
- tomcat55 and tomcat6 cross site scripting problem
tomcat was updated to fix a cross-site-scripting vulnerability in
the host-manager. (CVE-2008-1947)
Since the problem only affects tomcat 5.5 and tomcat 6 only those
were fixed in openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0. Other products were not
affected.
- squid denial of service problem in ASN.1 parsing
Squid was updated to fix an old denial-of-service bug that can
occur while parsing ASN.1 data. (CVE-2004-0918)
More details can be found on:
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2008_1.txt>
Only Squid 3.0 was affected, which is only on openSUSE 11.0 and
was fixed there.
- freetype2 various integer overflows
This update of freetype2 fixes several potential vulnerabilities
reported by iDefense.
CVE-2008-1806: Integer overflow in FreeType2 allows context-dependent
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted set of 16-bit
length values within the Private dictionary table in a Printer Font
Binary (PFB) file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
CVE-2008-1807: FreeType2 allow context-dependent attackers to execute
arbitrary code via an invalid "number of axes" field in a Printer
Font Binary (PFB) file, which triggers a free of arbitrary memory
locations, leading to memory corruption.
CVE-2008-1808: Multiple off-by-one errors in FreeType2 before 2.3.6
allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via
(1) a crafted table in a Printer Font Binary (PFB) file or (2)
a crafted SHC instruction in a TrueType Font (TTF) file, which
triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
Freetype2 was updated on all distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Debian Bug     : 418057 412945 444267 530838

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the imagemagick image
manipulation programs which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code,
exposure of sensitive information or cause DoS. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-1667

   Multiple integer overflows in XInitImage function in xwd.c for
   ImageMagick, allow user-assisted remote attackers to cause a	denial of
   service (crash) or obtain sensitive information via crafted images with
   large or negative values that trigger a buffer overflow. It only affects
   the oldstable distribution (etch).

CVE-2007-1797

   Multiple integer overflows allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
   code via a crafted DCM image, or the colors or comments field in a
   crafted XWD image. It only affects the oldstable distribution (etch).

CVE-2007-4985

   A crafted image file can trigger an infinite loop in the ReadDCMImage
   function or in the ReadXCFImage function. It only affects the oldstable
   distribution (etch).

CVE-2007-4986

   Multiple integer overflows allow context-dependent attackers to execute
   arbitrary code via a crafted .dcm, .dib, .xbm, .xcf, or .xwd image file,
   which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. It only affects the
   oldstable distribution (etch).

CVE-2007-4987

   Off-by-one error allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary
   code via a crafted image file, which triggers the writing of a '\0'
   character to an out-of-bounds address. It affects only the oldstable
   distribution (etch).

CVE-2007-4988

   A sign extension error allows context-dependent attackers to execute
   arbitrary code via a crafted width value in an image file, which
   triggers an integer overflow and a heap-based buffer overflow. It
   affects only the oldstable distribution (etch).

CVE-2008-1096

   The load_tile function in the XCF coder allows user-assisted remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
   code via a crafted .xcf file that triggers an out-of-bounds heap write.
   It affects only to oldstable (etch).

CVE-2008-1097

   Heap-based buffer overflow in the PCX coder allows user-assisted remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
   code via a crafted .pcx file that triggers incorrect memory allocation
   for the scanline array, leading to memory corruption. It affects only to
   oldstable (etch).

CVE-2009-1882

   Integer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF file,
   which triggers a buffer overflow.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7:6.2.4.5.dfsg1-0.15+etch1.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 7:6.3.7.9.dfsg2-1~lenny3.

For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version
7:6.5.1.0-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
