How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security advisory

## Potential vulnerability in Flash CS3 Professional, Flash Professional 8 and Flash Basic 8

**Release date:** March 19, 2008

**Vulnerability identifier:** APSA08-03

**CVE number:** CVE-2008-1201

**Platform:** Windows

### Summary

Adobe is aware of a recently published security issue in Flash CS3 Professional, Flash Professional 8 and Flash Basic 8 that could potentially cause code execution. This issue does not affect any version of Flash Player. An attacker would need to convince a user to open a malicious FLA file to successfully exploit the issue.

### Details

An attacker would need to convince a user to open a malicious FLA file to successfully exploit the issue. Adobe recommends that developers exercise caution when receiving unsolicited or suspicious FLA files. This issue does not affect the Mac versions of Flash Professional and Flash Basic.

FLA is the private file format of Flash Professional and Flash Basic. Flash Player and browsers can not interpret FLA files, so remote exploitation is not possible, and this issue does not affect any version of Flash Player. It is uncommon to find FLA files on web sites other than well-known web sites that include downloadable FLA files as tutorials for Flash users. FLA files can not be interpreted or viewed natively by Operating Systems such as Windows or Mac OS. Adobe will be fixing this issue in the next major release of Flash Professional.

### Severity Rating

Adobe categorizes this as a [critical issue](/devnet/security/security_zone/severity_ratings.html) and recommends that developers exercise caution when receiving unsolicited or suspicious FLA files.

### Acknowledgments

Adobe would like to thank cocoruder of [Fortinet Security Research Team](http://www.fortinet.com/) for reporting this vulnerability and for working with us to help protect our customers' security.
