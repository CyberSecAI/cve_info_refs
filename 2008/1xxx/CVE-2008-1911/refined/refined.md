Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1911:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The identified vulnerabilities stem from two main issues within 1024 CMS versions 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 (beta):

1.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `news.php` script in `/pages/print/default/ops/` includes a language file based on a user-provided `lang` parameter without proper sanitization. The `$lang` variable is not initialized, allowing an attacker to manipulate the `lang` parameter to include arbitrary local files.

2.  **Blind SQL Injection:** The `/includes/system.php` script uses unsanitized cookie values (`cookuid`, `cookpass`, `cooktype`, `cooklogged`) in an SQL query. The `cookpass` value is directly inserted into the query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, this is a blind SQL injection since the query results are not directly revealed but can be inferred by observing delays caused by the `BENCHMARK` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Failure to sanitize user-provided input when including local files.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Failure to sanitize user-provided cookie values used in SQL queries. The application uses the mysql extension, which does not offer prepared statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   An attacker can include and potentially execute arbitrary local files on the server. This could lead to:
        *   Reading sensitive files from the server such as configuration files or source code.
        *   Remote code execution if an attacker manages to include an uploaded file.
        *   Data exfiltration.
2.  **Blind SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database through blind SQL injection.
    *   In this specific exploit, the attacker retrieves the admin hash.
    *   Database compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `news.php` script, manipulating the `lang` parameter to include a local file path.
    *   Example: `[host]/[path]/pages/print/default/ops/news.php?id=1&lang=../../../../../[local file]%00`

2.  **Blind SQL Injection:** The attacker modifies cookie values, especially `cookpass`, to inject SQL code into the authentication query located within `/includes/system.php`.
    *   The exploit uses time-based blind injection using the `BENCHMARK` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **LFI:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
    *   The attacker needs to know the path to the local file they want to include.
    *   `magic_quotes_gpc` must be off.
    *   `register_globals` must be on.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server and modify cookie values.
    *   `magic_quotes_gpc` must be off.
    *  Knowledge of SQL syntax and time based blind SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code in Perl is used to automate the blind SQL injection process.
*   The exploit targets the retrieval of the admin hash from the database using the vulnerable SQL query.
*   The LFI vulnerability requires the `magic_quotes_gpc` setting to be off and `register_globals` to be on, which are not common default configurations.
*   The blind SQL injection vulnerability requires the `magic_quotes_gpc` setting to be off.
