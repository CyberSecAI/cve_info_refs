Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `msg_id` parameter of the `archives.php` script of phpMyNewsletter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `msg_id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, specifically the `admin_email` and `admin_pass` from the `pmnl_config` table.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted URL with a malicious `msg_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is needed, making it an anonymous remote vulnerability if the vulnerable application is exposed to the internet.
- `magic_quotes_gpc` must be off on the server hosting the PHP application

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit leverages a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection to extract the `admin_email` and `admin_pass` fields from the `pmnl_config` table.
- The exploit uses a URL like this: `archives.php?msg_id='%20UNION%20SELECT%201,1,admin_email,admin_pass%20%20FROM%20pmnl_config%2f%2a&list_id=1`
- The script checks if it successfully extracted the email and password using a regular expression on the returned page.
