Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1225 (Based on the provided content)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in WebCT 4.x. Specifically, the application does not adequately check or filter JavaScript code within mail and discussion board messages. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript is stored within messages and executed when a victim views the message. This can be used for session hijacking by stealing cookies.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** WebCT fails to sanitize user-provided content, allowing JavaScript injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Stealing:** Attackers can steal user session cookies, gaining complete access to the victim's account.
*   **Account Hijacking:** By using the stolen cookies, the attacker can log in as the victim and perform actions within their account, including accessing personal information, changing settings, and potentially posting further malicious content.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The injected JavaScript could be customized to perform further malicious actions within the context of the victim's session, such as posting messages, sending emails, or performing other actions they are authorized to take.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Messages:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into mail or discussion board messages. The attacker must disable the "wrap text" option which will prevent the Javascript from running.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The victim must access and view the malicious message for the JavaScript to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WebCT Account:** The attacker needs an account on the vulnerable WebCT instance to post the malicious message.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the JavaScript injection vulnerability.
*   **Remote Logger:** The attacker needs a remote location to log the stolen cookies. In the example provided, it is hosted on the attacker's server (logger.php).
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to inject the acquired cookies into their own browser session, for example, by using a cookie editor plugin.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Multiple Exploit Methods:** The provided content outlines two specific attack methods, one designed for Internet Explorer 6 SP2 (Attack 1 - Automatic) using a style tag with `javascript:eval` and a second method for Firefox (Attack 2 - Manual) using a base64 encoded `data:` URI to run Javascript.
*   **Student Limitation:** The exploit is noted to primarily work against student accounts and is not effective against teacher/admin accounts (though the note also states that javascript can also be developed to post messages, which works for all types of victims).
*   **Bypass of Text Wrapping:** The exploit depends on disabling text wrapping in the posting, to prevent the Javascript from being encoded and therefore not executed.
*   **Logger Customization:** The remote logger used can have a `notify_email` to send an email when a cookie is stolen.
