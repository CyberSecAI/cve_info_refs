{
  "Root cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `kid` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication and potentially gain access to sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords, from the `exv2_users` table.  It may also be possible to execute arbitrary SQL queries and potentially gain further control over the database.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the `kid` parameter of the `modules/viso/index.php` script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application with a crafted `kid` parameter."
