Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1349

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `bamagalerie3` module of eXV2 and RunCMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `cid` parameter in `viewcat.php` is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially allowing them to retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `viewcat.php` script within the vulnerable module. The attacker injects SQL code into the `cid` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing prior authentication.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable web application.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit examples use a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the database's user table, which contains usernames and passwords.
- Example exploit URL for eXV2:
`viewcat.php?cid=-9999999/**/union/**/select/**/0,1,2,3,concat(uname,0x3a,pass),5,6/**/from/**/e_xoops_users/*`
- Example exploit URLs for RunCMS:
`modules/bamagalerie3/viewcat.php?id=31&cid=-99999/**/union/**/select/**/0,pass/**/from/**/runcms_users/*`
`modules/bamagalerie3/viewcat.php?id=31&cid=-99999/**/union/**/select/**/0,uname/**/from/**/runcms_users/*`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in eXV2 Module bamaGalerie 3.03 and RUNCMS 1.1A bamagalerie3 Module.
- The exploit-db entries provide "dorks" (search queries) to locate vulnerable instances of the application on the internet.
