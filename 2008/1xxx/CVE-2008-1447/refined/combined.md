## Multiple DNS implementations vulnerable to cache poisoning

#### Vulnerability Note VU#800113

Original Release Date: 2008-07-08 | Last Revised: 2014-04-14

---

### Overview

Deficiencies in the DNS protocol and common DNS implementations facilitate DNS cache poisoning attacks.

### Description

| The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating host names to IP addresses (and vice versa) and is critical for the normal operation of internet-connected systems. DNS cache poisoning (sometimes referred to as cache pollution) is an attack technique that allows an attacker to introduce forged DNS information into the cache of a caching nameserver. DNS cache poisoning is not a new concept; in fact, there are published articles that describe a number of inherent deficiencies in the DNS protocol and defects in common DNS implementations that facilitate DNS cache poisoning. The following are examples of these deficiencies and defects:     + **Insufficient transaction ID space**  The DNS protocol specification includes a transaction ID field of 16 bits. If the specification is correctly implemented and the transaction ID is randomly selected with a strong random number generator, an attacker will require, on average, 32,768 attempts to successfully predict the ID. Some flawed implementations may use a smaller number of bits for this transaction ID, meaning that fewer attempts will be needed. Furthermore, there are known errors with the randomness of transaction IDs that are generated by a number of implementations. Amit Klein researched several affected implementations in 2007. These vulnerabilities are described in the following vulnerability notes:      - [VU#484649](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/484649) - Microsoft Windows DNS Server vulnerable to cache poisoning - [VU#252735](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/252735) - ISC BIND generates cryptographically weak DNS query IDs - [VU#927905](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/927905) - BIND version 8 generates cryptographically weak DNS query identifiers    + **Multiple outstanding requests**  Some implementations of DNS services contain a vulnerability in which multiple identical queries for the same resource record (RR) will generate multiple outstanding queries for that RR. This condition leads to the feasibility of a "birthday attack," which significantly raises an attacker's chance of success. This problem was previously described in [VU#457875](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/457875). A number of vendors and implementations have already added mitigations to address this issue.    + **Fixed source port for generating queries**  Some current implementations allocate an arbitrary port at startup (sometimes selected at random) and reuse this source port for all outgoing queries. In some implementations, the source port for outgoing queries is fixed at the traditional assigned DNS server port number, 53/udp.Recent additional research into these issues and methods of combining them to conduct improved cache poisoning attacks have yielded extremely effective exploitation techniques. Caching DNS resolvers are primarily at risk--both those that are open (a DNS resolver is open if it provides recursive name resolution for clients outside of its administrative domain), and those that are not. These caching resolvers are the most common target for attackers; however, stub resolvers are also at risk. Because attacks against these vulnerabilities all rely on an attacker's ability to predictably spoof traffic, the implementation of per-query source port randomization in the server presents a practical mitigation against these attacks within the boundaries of the current protocol specification. Randomized source ports can be used to gain approximately 16 additional bits of randomness in the data that an attacker must guess. Although there are technically 65,535 ports, implementers cannot allocate all of them (port numbers <1024 may be reserved, other ports may already be allocated, etc.). However, randomizing the ports that are available adds a significant amount of attack resiliency. It is important to note that without changes to the DNS protocol, such as those that the [DNS Security Extensions](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033) (DNSSEC) introduce, these mitigations cannot completely prevent cache poisoning. However, if properly implemented, the mitigations reduce an attacker's chances of success by several orders of magnitude and make attacks impractical. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with the ability to conduct a successful cache poisoning attack can cause a nameserver's clients to contact the incorrect, and possibly malicious, hosts for particular services. Consequently, web traffic, email, and other important network data can be redirected to systems under the attacker's control. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**A number of vendors have released patches to implement source port randomization in the nameserver. This change significantly reduces the practicality of cache poisoning attacks. Please see the Systems Affected portion of this document for additional details for specific vendors. Additional information about Japanese vendors can be found in JPCERT/CC [JVNVU#800113](https://jvn.jp/cert/JVNVU800113/).Stub resolvers are also vulnerable to these attacks, so system administrators should patch stub resolvers that issue queries in response to attacker behavior and that may receive packets from an attacker. Administrators should watch for patches to client operating systems that implement port randomization in the stub resolver.**Note:** Routers, firewalls, proxies, and other gateway devices that perform Network Address Translation (NAT)--more specifically Port Address Translation (PAT)--often rewrite source ports in order to track connection state. When modifying source ports, PAT devices can reduce source port randomness implemented by nameservers and stub resolvers (conversely, a PAT device can also increase randomness). A PAT device can reduce or eliminate improvements gained by patching DNS software to implement source port randomization. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**  Administrators, particularly those who are unable to apply a patch, can limit exposure to this vulnerability by restricting sources that can ask for recursion. Note that restricting access will still allow attackers with access to authorized hosts to exploit this vulnerability. The document "[Securing an Internet Name Server](http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/dns.pdf)" contains instructions for restricting recursion in ISC BIND.**Filter traffic at network perimeters**Because the ability to spoof IP addresses is necessary to conduct these attacks, administrators should filter spoofed addresses at the network perimeter. IETF Request for Comments (RFC) documents [RFC 2827](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2827), [RFC 3704](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3704), and [RFC 3013](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3013) describe best current practices (BCPs) for implementing this defense. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. **Run a local DNS cache**In lieu of strong port randomization characteristics in a stub resolver, administrators can protect their systems by using local caching full-service resolvers both on the client systems and on servers that are topologically close (on the network) to the client systems. These resolvers should be used in conjunction with the network segmentation and filtering strategies mentioned above.**Disable recursion**Disable recursion on any nameserver responding to DNS requests made by untrusted systems. "[Securing an Internet Name Server](http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/dns.pdf)" contains instructions for disabling recursion in various versions of ISC's BIND.The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [Special Publication 800-81 "Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide"](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-81/SP800-81.pdf) contains detailed and thorough information about the secure deployment of DNS servers, including the recommendations above. Administrators are strongly encouraged to review this document and consider implementing the recommendations it describes.**Implement source port randomization**Vendors that implement DNS software are encouraged to review IETF Internet Draft "[Measures for making DNS more resilient against forged answers](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsext-forgery-resilience)" for additional information about implementing mitigations in their products. This document is a work in progress and may change prior to its publication as an RFC, if it is approved. System implementers may also wish to review IETF Internet Draft "[Port Randomization](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-port-randomization)" for a more generalized approach to how port randomization can mitigate some other types of spoofing attacks.As noted [above](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113#pat), routers, firewalls, and other gateway devices that perform NAT/PAT may modify source ports in ways that reduce the effectiveness of source port randomization. |

Bulletin ID: 2008-07-28-001-ipa
Revision: 1.0

Title:
Multiple DNS implementations vulnerable to cache poisoning
(US-CERT Vulnerability Note VU#800113)

Summary:
Multiple FEC products may be subjected to the vulnerability described in US-CERT Note VU#800113. This vulnerability describes the principal possibility of DNS cache poisoning. An attacker with the ability to conduct a successful cache poisoning attack can cause a nameserver’s clients to contact the incorrect, and possibly malicious, hosts for particular services. Consequently, web traffic, email, and other important network data can be redirected to systems under the attacker's control.

Products affected:
All FEC products running the BOSS operating system are affected.

Details (full details at: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113>):
The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating host names to IP addresses (and vice versa) and is critical for the normal operation of internet-connected systems. DNS cache poisoning (sometimes referred to as cache pollution) is an attack technique that allows an attacker to introduce forged DNS information into the cache of a caching nameserver. DNS cache poisoning is not a new concept; in fact, there are published articles that describe a number of inherent deficiencies in the DNS protocol and defects in common DNS implementations that facilitate DNS cache poisoning. The following are examples of these deficiencies and defects:
a) Insufficient transaction ID space
The DNS protocol specification includes a transaction ID field of 16 bits. If the specification is correctly implemented and the transaction ID is randomly selected with a strong random number generator, an attacker will require, on average, 32,768 attempts to successfully predict the ID. Some flawed implementations may use a smaller number of bits for this transaction ID, meaning that fewer attempts will be needed.
b) Multiple outstanding requests
Some implementations of DNS services contain a vulnerability in which multiple identical queries for the same resource record (RR) will generate multiple outstanding queries for that RR. This condition leads to the feasibility of a 'birthday attack,' which significantly raises an attacker's chance of success. This problem was previously described in VU#457875. A number of vendors and implementations have already added mitigations to address this issue.
c) Fixed source port for generating queries
Some current implementations allocate an arbitrary port at startup (sometimes selected at random) and reuse this source port for all outgoing queries. In some implementations, the source port for outgoing queries is fixed at the traditional assigned DNS server port number, 53/udp.

Software Patches and Recommendation:
Susceptibility to the vulnerabilities has been removed and patches are available in the download area of our web site at <http://www.funkwerk-ec.com>. For security reasons it is recommended to update all affected FEC products with the appropriate software patch (see the following list for more details):

VPN Access Series: 7.4.1 PATCH 11
X8500            : 7.4.1 PATCH 11
R200 Series      : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
R1200            : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
R3x00 Series     : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
R4x00 Series     : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
TR200            : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
Wx002 Series     : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
WI Series        : 7.6.1 PATCH 2

To determine the software version running on a FEC router, log in to the device and issue the command "show rev". For products offering the Funkwerk Configuration Interface, point your browser at the IP address of your FEC product. You can find the version information on the status page. This will display the current software version running on the  system (see row denoted with Boss). A description how to update a FEC router can be found within the product documentation (see chapter Gateway Management). If you want to update  your software, make sure you read the relevant Release Notes. They describe all changes  introduced with the new system software.

### [Internet Systems Consortium](#MIMG-7E6K7P) Affected

Notified:  April 29, 2008  Updated: July 14, 2008

**Statement Date:   July 03, 2008**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

ISC is providing patches for BIND 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5 (tagged -P1) that
implement measures to enhance resilience against this sort of attack.
BIND accomplishes this by including the use of the source port queries
as additional information that would need to be predicted by a
successful attack.

ISC is also making beta releases, BIND 9.5.1b1 and 9.4.3b2 available
for download and testing.  These beta releases provide the same
improved resiliency as the patches but with better performance for
servers with query volumes at or above 10,000 queries per second.
They are however betas, not fully tested production releases. The
patches,(P1 versions), are fully tested today and released for
production use.  Older versions of BIND 9 and BIND 8 will not be
patched as they are EOL.

ISC notes that even with these measures, the nature of the DNS
protocol is such that attacks of this nature may still succeed. The
only solution to fully counter this sort of attack is to deploy DNSSEC
in DNS zones and enable DNSSEC validation in the resolvers.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#MIMG-7ECLB3) Affected

Notified:  May 05, 2008  Updated: July 17, 2008

**Statement Date:   July 17, 2008**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Openwall GNU/\*/Linux (Owl) 2.0-stable and current used versions of BIND
that did not randomize query source port numbers.  This has been
corrected by updating to BIND 9.3.5-P1 in Owl-current on July 8th and in
Owl 2.0-stable on July 11th, 2008.  Query IDs were already being
randomized by versions of BIND in supported branches of Owl.

Additionally, the DNS resolver in our revision of the GNU C Library
(glibc) had been modified to randomize query IDs in year 2000, before
Owl was first made available to the general public.  However, it was
not, and it still has not been, modified to randomize source ports as
well.  With these issues getting more attention lately, this is being
considered as a higher priority task now.

Also relevant is the fact that running our "userland" with a recent
Linux kernel (2.6.24 or newer) introduces randomization of source port
numbers for UDP-based queries, although added security of this setup has
not been fully evaluated (specifically, whether new port numbers are
allocated for every query in all cases and whether the produced sequence
of random port numbers is sufficiently cryptographically secure).

### [SUSE Linux](#MIMG-7ECLCH) Affected

Notified:  May 05, 2008  Updated: July 11, 2008

**Statement Date:   July 11, 2008**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

SUSE Linux products include bind, powerdns-recursor and dnsmasq
as name servers.

An update for bind is available as online update since 2008-07-10
and we posted the SUSE-SA:2008:033 advisory to:
<http://www.novell.com/linux/security/advisories/2008_33_bind.html>

The last powerdns-recursor security update from May also added
random UDP source-ports which should make it not vulnerable to the
new attack Dan Kaminsky found.

The DNS forwarder dnsmasq does not emit recursive queries and
is therefore not vulnerable as far as we know. Additionally
dnsmasq will be fixed to use a CPRNG for generating the TRXID
and the UDP source-port.

### [MaraDNS](#CRDY-7GENET) Not Affected

Updated:  July 10, 2008

**Statement Date:   June 27, 2008**

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

MaraDNS uses a secure random number generator to generate both the query
ID and the port to bind to.  In more detail, MaraDNS uses information from
the file /dev/urandom as a random seed to generate a cryptographic key.
Using a variant of AES, MaraDNS has 16 bits of entropy for the query ID
and 12 bits of entropy for the source port.

Deadwood, a from-the-ground-up reimplementation of MaraDNS also uses a secure
random number generator.  Instead of using an AES variant, Deadwood uses a
stream cipher called "Radio Gatun" (a derivative of Panama) as the random
number generator.

Note that the Windows port, if improperly configured, will have possible
security issues because there is not a convenient pool of random numbers
on that platform.

So, in summary, I am aware of this security problem and have gone to some
effort make sure MaraDNS (and Deadwood) does not have this issue.

### [NLnet Labs](#MIMG-7EMJVA) Not Affected

Notified:  May 14, 2008  Updated: July 10, 2008

**Statement Date:   May 16, 2008**

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

Unbound implements numerous strategies to prevent spoof protection,

those include udp port randomization,  rtt banding, source ip
randomization, and optionally, so called 0x20 query name randomization.
Besides, Unbound features an architectural element that performs sanity
checks on incoming data to prevent certain types of poisoning attempts.

Although Unbound has been built using all known protections against DNS
spoofs, the DNS protocol is inherently vulnerable to these sorts of
attacks. NLnet Labs believes that the only real solution to this problem
is the use of DNSSEC.

### Vendor Information

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

PowerDNS Vendor Statement
-------------------------
Since version 3.0, released in April 2006, the PowerDNS Recursor resolving
nameserver has implemented measures that protect against the vulnerability
described in CVE-2008-1447. Source ports are randomized, and 'near misses',
indicating a spoofing attempt in progress, are detected, and the query is
dropped.

Although all 3.x versions implement these measures, from 3.1.6 a
cryptographically secure random generator is used which further enhances
protection against spoofing, so an upgrade to 3.1.6 or higher is advised.

Package        : glibc
Vulnerability  : DNS cache poisoning
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1447
CERT advisory  : VU#800113

Dan Kaminsky discovered that properties inherent to the DNS protocol
lead to practical DNS spoofing and cache poisoning attacks.  Among
other things, successful attacks can lead to misdirected web traffic
and email rerouting.

At this time, it is not possible to implement the recommended
countermeasures in the GNU libc stub resolver.  The following
workarounds are available:

1. Install a local BIND 9 resoler on the host, possibly in
forward-only mode.  BIND 9 will then use source port randomization
when sending queries over the network.  (Other caching resolvers can
be used instead.)

2. Rely on IP address spoofing protection if available.  Successful
attacks must spoof the address of one of the resolvers, which may not
be possible if the network is guarded properly against IP spoofing
attacks (both from internal and external sources).

This DSA will be updated when patches for hardening the stub resolver
are available.

# Multiple vulnerabilities in Ruby

Posted by Shugo Maeda on 8 Aug 2008

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ruby. It's recommended
that you upgrade to the latest versions.

## Details

The following vulnerabilities have been discovered.

### Several vulnerabilities in safe level

Several vulnerabilities in safe level have been discovered.

* untrace\_var is permitted at safe level 4.

  ```
  trace_var(:$VAR) {|val| puts "$VAR = #{val}" }

  Thread.new do
   $SAFE = 4
   eval %q{
     proc = untrace_var :$VAR
     proc.first.call("aaa")
   }
  end.join

  ```
* $PROGRAM\_NAME may be modified at safe level 4.

  ```
  Thread.new do
   $SAFE = 4
   eval %q{$PROGRAM_NAME.replace "Hello, World!"}
  end.join

  $PROGRAM_NAME #=> "Hello, World!"

  ```
* Insecure methods may be called at safe level 1-3.

  ```
  class Hello
   def world
     Thread.new do
       $SAFE = 4
       msg = "Hello, World!"
       def msg.size
         self.replace self*10 # replace string
         1 # return wrong size
       end
       msg
     end.value
   end
  end

  $SAFE = 1 # or 2, or 3
  s = Hello.new.world
  if s.kind_of?(String)
   puts s if s.size < 20 # print string which size is less than 20
  end

  ```
* Syslog operations are permitted at safe level 4.

  ```
  require "syslog"

  Syslog.open

  Thread.new do
   $SAFE = 4
   eval %q{
     Syslog.log(Syslog::LOG_WARNING, "Hello, World!")
     Syslog.mask = Syslog::LOG_UPTO(Syslog::LOG_EMERG)
     Syslog.info("masked")
     Syslog.close
   }
  end.join

  ```

These vulnerabilities were reported by Keita Yamaguchi.

### DoS vulnerability in WEBrick

WEBrick::HTTP::DefaultFileHandler is faulty of exponential time taking
requests due to a backtracking regular expression in
WEBrick::HTTPUtils.split\_header\_value.

Exploitable server:

```
require 'webrick'
WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(:Port => 2000, :DocumentRoot => "/etc").start

```

Attack:

```
require 'net/http'
res = Net::HTTP.start("localhost", 2000) { |http|
  req = Net::HTTP::Get.new("/passwd")
  req['If-None-Match'] = %q{meh=""} + %q{foo="bar" } * 100
  http.request(req)
}
p res

```

The request likely won't finish in this universe.

This vulnerability was reported by Christian Neukirchen.

### Lack of taintness check in dl

dl doesn't check taintness, so it could allow attackers to call
dangerous functions.

```
require 'dl'
$SAFE = 1
h = DL.dlopen(nil)
sys = h.sym('system', 'IP')
uname = 'uname -rs'.taint
sys[uname]

```

This vulnerability was reported by sheepman.

### DNS spoofing vulnerability in resolv.rb

resolv.rb allow remote attackers to spoof DNS answers. This risk can be
reduced by randomness of DNS transaction IDs and source ports, so
resolv.rb is fixed to randomize them.

* see also: [CVE-2008-1447](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1447)

This vulnerability was reported by Tanaka Akira.

## Vulnerable versions

* 1.8.5 and all prior versions
* 1.8.6-p286 and all prior versions
* 1.8.7-p71 and all prior versions

1.9 series

* r18423 and all prior revisions

## Solution

1.8 series
Please upgrade to 1.8.6-p287, or 1.8.7-p72.

* [<URL:https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.6-p287.tar.gz>](https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.6-p287.tar.gz)
* [<URL:https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.7-p72.tar.gz>](https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.7-p72.tar.gz)

1.9 series

Please check out the latest version using Subversion.

```
$ svn co https://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/trunk ruby

```

Please note that a package that corrects this weakness may already be
available through your package management software.

## Multiple DNS implementations vulnerable to cache poisoning

#### Vulnerability Note VU#800113

Original Release Date: 2008-07-08 | Last Revised: 2014-04-14

---

### Overview

Deficiencies in the DNS protocol and common DNS implementations facilitate DNS cache poisoning attacks.

### Description

| The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating host names to IP addresses (and vice versa) and is critical for the normal operation of internet-connected systems. DNS cache poisoning (sometimes referred to as cache pollution) is an attack technique that allows an attacker to introduce forged DNS information into the cache of a caching nameserver. DNS cache poisoning is not a new concept; in fact, there are published articles that describe a number of inherent deficiencies in the DNS protocol and defects in common DNS implementations that facilitate DNS cache poisoning. The following are examples of these deficiencies and defects:     + **Insufficient transaction ID space**  The DNS protocol specification includes a transaction ID field of 16 bits. If the specification is correctly implemented and the transaction ID is randomly selected with a strong random number generator, an attacker will require, on average, 32,768 attempts to successfully predict the ID. Some flawed implementations may use a smaller number of bits for this transaction ID, meaning that fewer attempts will be needed. Furthermore, there are known errors with the randomness of transaction IDs that are generated by a number of implementations. Amit Klein researched several affected implementations in 2007. These vulnerabilities are described in the following vulnerability notes:      - [VU#484649](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/484649) - Microsoft Windows DNS Server vulnerable to cache poisoning - [VU#252735](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/252735) - ISC BIND generates cryptographically weak DNS query IDs - [VU#927905](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/927905) - BIND version 8 generates cryptographically weak DNS query identifiers    + **Multiple outstanding requests**  Some implementations of DNS services contain a vulnerability in which multiple identical queries for the same resource record (RR) will generate multiple outstanding queries for that RR. This condition leads to the feasibility of a "birthday attack," which significantly raises an attacker's chance of success. This problem was previously described in [VU#457875](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/457875). A number of vendors and implementations have already added mitigations to address this issue.    + **Fixed source port for generating queries**  Some current implementations allocate an arbitrary port at startup (sometimes selected at random) and reuse this source port for all outgoing queries. In some implementations, the source port for outgoing queries is fixed at the traditional assigned DNS server port number, 53/udp.Recent additional research into these issues and methods of combining them to conduct improved cache poisoning attacks have yielded extremely effective exploitation techniques. Caching DNS resolvers are primarily at risk--both those that are open (a DNS resolver is open if it provides recursive name resolution for clients outside of its administrative domain), and those that are not. These caching resolvers are the most common target for attackers; however, stub resolvers are also at risk. Because attacks against these vulnerabilities all rely on an attacker's ability to predictably spoof traffic, the implementation of per-query source port randomization in the server presents a practical mitigation against these attacks within the boundaries of the current protocol specification. Randomized source ports can be used to gain approximately 16 additional bits of randomness in the data that an attacker must guess. Although there are technically 65,535 ports, implementers cannot allocate all of them (port numbers <1024 may be reserved, other ports may already be allocated, etc.). However, randomizing the ports that are available adds a significant amount of attack resiliency. It is important to note that without changes to the DNS protocol, such as those that the [DNS Security Extensions](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033) (DNSSEC) introduce, these mitigations cannot completely prevent cache poisoning. However, if properly implemented, the mitigations reduce an attacker's chances of success by several orders of magnitude and make attacks impractical. |

### Impact

| An attacker with the ability to conduct a successful cache poisoning attack can cause a nameserver's clients to contact the incorrect, and possibly malicious, hosts for particular services. Consequently, web traffic, email, and other important network data can be redirected to systems under the attacker's control. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**A number of vendors have released patches to implement source port randomization in the nameserver. This change significantly reduces the practicality of cache poisoning attacks. Please see the Systems Affected portion of this document for additional details for specific vendors. Additional information about Japanese vendors can be found in JPCERT/CC [JVNVU#800113](https://jvn.jp/cert/JVNVU800113/).Stub resolvers are also vulnerable to these attacks, so system administrators should patch stub resolvers that issue queries in response to attacker behavior and that may receive packets from an attacker. Administrators should watch for patches to client operating systems that implement port randomization in the stub resolver.**Note:** Routers, firewalls, proxies, and other gateway devices that perform Network Address Translation (NAT)--more specifically Port Address Translation (PAT)--often rewrite source ports in order to track connection state. When modifying source ports, PAT devices can reduce source port randomness implemented by nameservers and stub resolvers (conversely, a PAT device can also increase randomness). A PAT device can reduce or eliminate improvements gained by patching DNS software to implement source port randomization. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**  Administrators, particularly those who are unable to apply a patch, can limit exposure to this vulnerability by restricting sources that can ask for recursion. Note that restricting access will still allow attackers with access to authorized hosts to exploit this vulnerability. The document "[Securing an Internet Name Server](http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/dns.pdf)" contains instructions for restricting recursion in ISC BIND.**Filter traffic at network perimeters**Because the ability to spoof IP addresses is necessary to conduct these attacks, administrators should filter spoofed addresses at the network perimeter. IETF Request for Comments (RFC) documents [RFC 2827](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2827), [RFC 3704](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3704), and [RFC 3013](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3013) describe best current practices (BCPs) for implementing this defense. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. **Run a local DNS cache**In lieu of strong port randomization characteristics in a stub resolver, administrators can protect their systems by using local caching full-service resolvers both on the client systems and on servers that are topologically close (on the network) to the client systems. These resolvers should be used in conjunction with the network segmentation and filtering strategies mentioned above.**Disable recursion**Disable recursion on any nameserver responding to DNS requests made by untrusted systems. "[Securing an Internet Name Server](http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/dns.pdf)" contains instructions for disabling recursion in various versions of ISC's BIND.The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [Special Publication 800-81 "Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide"](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-81/SP800-81.pdf) contains detailed and thorough information about the secure deployment of DNS servers, including the recommendations above. Administrators are strongly encouraged to review this document and consider implementing the recommendations it describes.**Implement source port randomization**Vendors that implement DNS software are encouraged to review IETF Internet Draft "[Measures for making DNS more resilient against forged answers](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsext-forgery-resilience)" for additional information about implementing mitigations in their products. This document is a work in progress and may change prior to its publication as an RFC, if it is approved. System implementers may also wish to review IETF Internet Draft "[Port Randomization](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-port-randomization)" for a more generalized approach to how port randomization can mitigate some other types of spoofing attacks.As noted [above](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113#pat), routers, firewalls, and other gateway devices that perform NAT/PAT may modify source ports in ways that reduce the effectiveness of source port randomization. |

Bulletin ID: 2008-07-28-001-ipa
Revision: 1.0

Title:
Multiple DNS implementations vulnerable to cache poisoning
(US-CERT Vulnerability Note VU#800113)

Summary:
Multiple FEC products may be subjected to the vulnerability described in US-CERT Note VU#800113. This vulnerability describes the principal possibility of DNS cache poisoning. An attacker with the ability to conduct a successful cache poisoning attack can cause a nameserver’s clients to contact the incorrect, and possibly malicious, hosts for particular services. Consequently, web traffic, email, and other important network data can be redirected to systems under the attacker's control.

Products affected:
All FEC products running the BOSS operating system are affected.

Details (full details at: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113>):
The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating host names to IP addresses (and vice versa) and is critical for the normal operation of internet-connected systems. DNS cache poisoning (sometimes referred to as cache pollution) is an attack technique that allows an attacker to introduce forged DNS information into the cache of a caching nameserver. DNS cache poisoning is not a new concept; in fact, there are published articles that describe a number of inherent deficiencies in the DNS protocol and defects in common DNS implementations that facilitate DNS cache poisoning. The following are examples of these deficiencies and defects:
a) Insufficient transaction ID space
The DNS protocol specification includes a transaction ID field of 16 bits. If the specification is correctly implemented and the transaction ID is randomly selected with a strong random number generator, an attacker will require, on average, 32,768 attempts to successfully predict the ID. Some flawed implementations may use a smaller number of bits for this transaction ID, meaning that fewer attempts will be needed.
b) Multiple outstanding requests
Some implementations of DNS services contain a vulnerability in which multiple identical queries for the same resource record (RR) will generate multiple outstanding queries for that RR. This condition leads to the feasibility of a 'birthday attack,' which significantly raises an attacker's chance of success. This problem was previously described in VU#457875. A number of vendors and implementations have already added mitigations to address this issue.
c) Fixed source port for generating queries
Some current implementations allocate an arbitrary port at startup (sometimes selected at random) and reuse this source port for all outgoing queries. In some implementations, the source port for outgoing queries is fixed at the traditional assigned DNS server port number, 53/udp.

Software Patches and Recommendation:
Susceptibility to the vulnerabilities has been removed and patches are available in the download area of our web site at <http://www.funkwerk-ec.com>. For security reasons it is recommended to update all affected FEC products with the appropriate software patch (see the following list for more details):

VPN Access Series: 7.4.1 PATCH 11
X8500            : 7.4.1 PATCH 11
R200 Series      : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
R1200            : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
R3x00 Series     : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
R4x00 Series     : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
TR200            : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
Wx002 Series     : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
WI Series        : 7.6.1 PATCH 2

To determine the software version running on a FEC router, log in to the device and issue the command "show rev". For products offering the Funkwerk Configuration Interface, point your browser at the IP address of your FEC product. You can find the version information on the status page. This will display the current software version running on the  system (see row denoted with Boss). A description how to update a FEC router can be found within the product documentation (see chapter Gateway Management). If you want to update  your software, make sure you read the relevant Release Notes. They describe all changes  introduced with the new system software.

### [Internet Systems Consortium](#MIMG-7E6K7P) Affected

Notified:  April 29, 2008  Updated: July 14, 2008

**Statement Date:   July 03, 2008**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

ISC is providing patches for BIND 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5 (tagged -P1) that
implement measures to enhance resilience against this sort of attack.
BIND accomplishes this by including the use of the source port queries
as additional information that would need to be predicted by a
successful attack.

ISC is also making beta releases, BIND 9.5.1b1 and 9.4.3b2 available
for download and testing.  These beta releases provide the same
improved resiliency as the patches but with better performance for
servers with query volumes at or above 10,000 queries per second.
They are however betas, not fully tested production releases. The
patches,(P1 versions), are fully tested today and released for
production use.  Older versions of BIND 9 and BIND 8 will not be
patched as they are EOL.

ISC notes that even with these measures, the nature of the DNS
protocol is such that attacks of this nature may still succeed. The
only solution to fully counter this sort of attack is to deploy DNSSEC
in DNS zones and enable DNSSEC validation in the resolvers.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#MIMG-7ECLB3) Affected

Notified:  May 05, 2008  Updated: July 17, 2008

**Statement Date:   July 17, 2008**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Openwall GNU/\*/Linux (Owl) 2.0-stable and current used versions of BIND
that did not randomize query source port numbers.  This has been
corrected by updating to BIND 9.3.5-P1 in Owl-current on July 8th and in
Owl 2.0-stable on July 11th, 2008.  Query IDs were already being
randomized by versions of BIND in supported branches of Owl.

Additionally, the DNS resolver in our revision of the GNU C Library
(glibc) had been modified to randomize query IDs in year 2000, before
Owl was first made available to the general public.  However, it was
not, and it still has not been, modified to randomize source ports as
well.  With these issues getting more attention lately, this is being
considered as a higher priority task now.

Also relevant is the fact that running our "userland" with a recent
Linux kernel (2.6.24 or newer) introduces randomization of source port
numbers for UDP-based queries, although added security of this setup has
not been fully evaluated (specifically, whether new port numbers are
allocated for every query in all cases and whether the produced sequence
of random port numbers is sufficiently cryptographically secure).

### Vendor Information

We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.

### [QNX, Software Systems, Inc.](#MIMG-7ECLB8) Affected

**Statement Date:   June 01, 2009**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

### [SUSE Linux](#MIMG-7ECLCH) Affected

Notified:  May 05, 2008  Updated: July 11, 2008

**Statement Date:   July 11, 2008**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

SUSE Linux products include bind, powerdns-recursor and dnsmasq
as name servers.

An update for bind is available as online update since 2008-07-10
and we posted the SUSE-SA:2008:033 advisory to:
<http://www.novell.com/linux/security/advisories/2008_33_bind.html>

The last powerdns-recursor security update from May also added
random UDP source-ports which should make it not vulnerable to the
new attack Dan Kaminsky found.

The DNS forwarder dnsmasq does not emit recursive queries and
is therefore not vulnerable as far as we know. Additionally
dnsmasq will be fixed to use a CPRNG for generating the TRXID
and the UDP source-port.

### [MaraDNS](#CRDY-7GENET) Not Affected

Updated:  July 10, 2008

**Statement Date:   June 27, 2008**

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

MaraDNS uses a secure random number generator to generate both the query
ID and the port to bind to.  In more detail, MaraDNS uses information from
the file /dev/urandom as a random seed to generate a cryptographic key.
Using a variant of AES, MaraDNS has 16 bits of entropy for the query ID
and 12 bits of entropy for the source port.

Deadwood, a from-the-ground-up reimplementation of MaraDNS also uses a secure
random number generator.  Instead of using an AES variant, Deadwood uses a
stream cipher called "Radio Gatun" (a derivative of Panama) as the random
number generator.

Note that the Windows port, if improperly configured, will have possible
security issues because there is not a convenient pool of random numbers
on that platform.

So, in summary, I am aware of this security problem and have gone to some
effort make sure MaraDNS (and Deadwood) does not have this issue.

### [NLnet Labs](#MIMG-7EMJVA) Not Affected

Notified:  May 14, 2008  Updated: July 10, 2008

**Statement Date:   May 16, 2008**

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

Unbound implements numerous strategies to prevent spoof protection,

those include udp port randomization,  rtt banding, source ip
randomization, and optionally, so called 0x20 query name randomization.
Besides, Unbound features an architectural element that performs sanity
checks on incoming data to prevent certain types of poisoning attempts.

Although Unbound has been built using all known protections against DNS
spoofs, the DNS protocol is inherently vulnerable to these sorts of
attacks. NLnet Labs believes that the only real solution to this problem
is the use of DNSSEC.

### Vendor Information

We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

The vendor has also posted an additional statement about this issue at the following location:

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

PowerDNS Vendor Statement
-------------------------
Since version 3.0, released in April 2006, the PowerDNS Recursor resolving
nameserver has implemented measures that protect against the vulnerability
described in CVE-2008-1447. Source ports are randomized, and 'near misses',
indicating a spoofing attempt in progress, are detected, and the query is
dropped.

Although all 3.x versions implement these measures, from 3.1.6 a
cryptographically secure random generator is used which further enhances
protection against spoofing, so an upgrade to 3.1.6 or higher is advised.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# BIND: Cache poisoning — GLSA **200807-08**

A weakness in the DNS protocol has been reported, which could lead to cache
poisoning on recursive resolvers.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-dns/bind** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.4.2\_p1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.4.2\_p1** |

### Background

ISC BIND is the Internet Systems Consortium implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocol.

### Description

Dan Kaminsky of IOActive has reported a weakness in the DNS protocol
related to insufficient randomness of DNS transaction IDs and query
source ports.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this weakness to poison the cache of a
recursive resolver and thus spoof DNS traffic, which could e.g. lead to
the redirection of web or mail traffic to malicious sites.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All BIND users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/bind-9.4.2_p1"
```

Note: In order to utilize the query port randomization to mitigate the
weakness, you need to make sure that your network setup allows the DNS
server to use random source ports for query and that you have not set a
fixed query port via the "query-source port" directive in the BIND
configuration.

#### iPod touch v2.1

* **Application Sandbox**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3631

  Available for: iPod touch v2.0 through v2.0.2

  Impact: An application may be able to read another application's files

  Description: The Application Sandbox does not properly enforce access restrictions between third-party applications. This may allow a third-party application to read files in another third-party application's sandbox and lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by enforcing the proper access restrictions between application sandboxes. Credit to Nicolas Seriot of Sen:te and Bryce Cogswell for reporting this issue. This issue does not affect iPod touch versions prior to v2.0.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-1806, CVE-2008-1807, CVE-2008-1808

  Available for: iPod touch v1.1 through v2.0.2

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in FreeType v2.3.5

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in FreeType v2.3.5, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution when accessing maliciously crafted font data. This update addresses the issue by incorporating the security fixes from version 2.3.6 of FreeType. Further information is available via the FreeType site at <http://www.freetype.org/>

* **mDNSResponder**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-1447

  Available for: iPod touch v1.1 through v2.0.2

  Impact: mDNSResponder is susceptible to DNS cache poisoning and may return forged information

  Description: mDNSResponder provides translation between host names and IP addresses for applications that use its unicast DNS resolution API. A weakness in the DNS protocol may allow a remote attacker to perform DNS cache poisoning attacks. As a result, applications that rely on mDNSResponder for DNS may receive forged information. This update addresses the issue by implementing source port and transaction ID randomization to improve resilience against cache poisoning attacks. Credit to Dan Kaminsky of IOActive for reporting this issue.

* **Networking**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3612

  Available for: iPod touch v1.1 through v2.0.2

  Impact: Predictable TCP initial sequence numbers generation may lead to TCP spoofing or session hijacking

  Description: TCP initial sequence numbers are sequentially generated. Predictable initial sequence numbers may allow a remote attacker to create a spoofed TCP connection or insert data into an existing TCP connection. This update addresses the issue by generating random TCP initial sequence numbers.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3632

  Available for: iPod touch v1.1 through v2.0.2

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A use-after-free issue exists in WebKit's handling of CSS import statements. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of document references.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Het departement Natuurkunde verzorgt allereerst [fysisch onderwijs](https://www.uu.nl/organisatie/departement-natuurkunde/onderwijs). Daarnaast [onderzoeken wetenschappers](https://www.uu.nl/organisatie/departement-natuurkunde/onderzoek), binnen de vier instituten die het departement rijk is, een breed terrein van de fysica: het kleinste dat we kennen, de elementaire deeltjes, het grootste dat we kennen, het heelal, en alles daartussenin.
Op die manier dragen we bij aan de ontwikkeling van fundamentele kennis en werken we direct aan oplossingen voor grote maatschappelijke vraagstukken, waaronder klimaatverandering en de energietransitie.
Ook organiseren we diverse [activiteiten en evenementen](https://www.uu.nl/organisatie/departement-natuurkunde/outreach), speciaal gericht op scholieren en een breed geïnteresseerd publiek.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=454852#c0)  Nigel Metheringham    2008-07-10 07:46:42 UTC  ``` [CVE-2008-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-1447) mitigation requires that the source port for DNS queries is randomized to make an attack more difficult.  The caching name server config file contains the following lines near the top:-    options {         ...         query-source    port 53;         query-source-v6 port 53;         allow-query     { localhost; };    };  The query-source directives prevent the randomization of sender port.  This causes warnings to be produced in the log file.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):   Version     : 9.3.4   Release     : 6.0.1.P1.el5_2   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=454852#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-07-10 08:11:53 UTC  ``` caching-nameserver is built from bind source RPM in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 -> moving to proper component.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=454852#c4)  Adam Tkac    2008-07-10 10:06:41 UTC  ``` You are right. Btw that options were in configuration file since 5.0 but it is far more better to drop them. Thanks for your report   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=454852#c6)  Mark J. Cox    2008-07-10 11:26:27 UTC  ``` We plan to reissue the RHEL 5.0 packages to include a fix for this issue.  We are treating this as an emergency exception, and the packages will be released as soon as they have cleared our standard QE and release processes.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=454852#c9)  Mark J. Cox    2008-07-10 19:58:08 UTC  ``` [Updated 10th July 2008] We have updated the Enterprise Linux 5 BIND packages. The default and sample caching-nameserver configuration files have been updated so that they do not specify a fixed query-source port. Administrators wishing to take advantage of randomized UDP source ports should check their configuration file to ensure they have not specified fixed query-source ports.  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0533.html>     ``` |  |

Cox    2008-07-03 10:11:28 UTC  ``` The DNS protocol protects against spoofing attacks by requiring an attacker to predict both the DNS transaction ID and UDP source port of a request. In the last few years a number of papers have found problems with DNS implementations making it easier for an attacker to perform DNS cache poisoning attacks.  Previous versions of BIND did not use randomized UDP source ports which could make DNS cache poisoning attacks easier if an attacker is able to predict the random DNS transaction ID. In order to provide more resilience, BIND has been updated to use a range of random UDP source ports. ([CVE-2008-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-1447))  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Dan Kaminsky for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=449345#c18)  Mark J.

BIND (since updates in previous years) has had sufficient transaction ID entropy.

This is not as serious an issue as with BIND caching-nameserver; with dnsmasq the attacker would need to be on the network 'between' dnsmasq and the (fixed) upstream nameservers.  See upstream commentary about this issue here: <http://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/2008q3/002147.html> <http://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/2008q3/002148.html> <http://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/2008q3/002165.html> (and follow-ups)   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=449345#c38)  Daniel Veillard    2008-07-10 13:39:34 UTC  ``` libvirt use of dnsmasq is really to provide dhcp and DNS on a virtual subnet for virtual machines running on the same node.  When run from libvirtd (the libvirt daemon) and based on the default config the command used is  /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --keep-in-foreground --strict-order --bind-interfaces --pid-file  --conf-file  --listen-address 192.168.122.1 --except-interface lo --dhcp-leasefile=/var/lib/libvirt/dhcp-default.leases --dhcp-range 192.168.122.2,192.168.122.254    i.e. it listens only on the localhost interface         -z, --bind-interfaces               On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard address,               even when it is listening on only some interfaces. It then  dis-               cards  requests  that it shouldn’t reply to. This has the advan-               tage of working even when interfaces  come  and  go  and  change               address.  This  option  forces  dnsmasq  to really bind only the               interfaces it is listening on. About the only time when this  is               useful  is  when running another nameserver (or another instance               of dnsmasq) on  the  same  machine.  Setting  this  option  also               enables multiple instances of dnsmasq which provide DHCP service               to run in the same machine.    So based on the use done by libvirt, I don't think there is a risk in that setup (but I'm not an expert).   However since the package is generally available I will check for further versions posted   Daniel   ```  [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=449345#c39)  Mark J. Cox    2008-07-10 19:57:27 UTC  ``` [Updated 10th July 2008] We have updated the Enterprise Linux 5 BIND packages.

* **001: SECURITY FIX: March 30, 2008**
    *All architectures*

  sshd(8) would execute ~/.ssh/rc even when a sshd\_config(5) *ForceCommand*
  directive was in effect, allowing users with write access to this file to
  execute arbitrary commands. This behaviour was documented, but was an unsafe
  default and an extra hassle for administrators.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/001_openssh.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: April 3, 2008**
      *All architectures*

    Avoid possible hijacking of X11-forwarded connections with sshd(8)
    by refusing to listen on a port unless all address families bind
    successfully.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/002_openssh2.patch)

    * **003: SECURITY FIX: July 15, 2008**
        *All architectures*

      Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in X.Org.

      RENDER Extension heap buffer overflow,
      RENDER Extension crash,
      RENDER Extension memory corruption,
      MIT-SHM arbitrary memory read,
      RECORD and Security extensions memory corruption.

      * **004: SECURITY FIX: July 23, 2008**
          *All architectures*

        **2nd revision, July 23, 2008**

        A vulnerability has been found with BIND. An attacker could use this vulnerability
        to poison the cache of a recursive resolving name server.
        [CVE-2008-1447](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1447).

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/004_bind.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: July 29, 2008**
            *All architectures*

          Some kinds of IPv6 usage would leak kernel memory (in particular, this path
          was exercised by the named(8) patch for port randomization). Since INET6 is
          enabled by default, this condition affects all systems.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/005_pcb.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: October 2, 2008**
              *All architectures*

            The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ndp) did not correctly verify neighbor
            solicitation requests maybe allowing a nearby attacker to intercept traffic.
            The attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for
            this vulnerability to be exploited.
            [CVE-2008-2476](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2476).

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/006_ndp.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: January 9, 2009**
                *All architectures*

              The OpenSSL libraries did not correctly check the return value from
              certain verification functions, allowing validation to be bypassed and
              permitting a remote attacker to conduct a "man in the middle attack"
              against SSL/TLS connections if the server is configured with a DSA or ECDSA
              certificate.
              [CVE-2008-5077](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5077).

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/007_openssl.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: January 14, 2009**
                  *All architectures*

                named(8) did not correctly check the return value of a DSA verification
                function, potentially allowing bypass of verification of DNSSEC DSA
                signatures.
                [CVE-2009-0025](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0025).

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/008_bind.patch)

                * **009: RELIABILITY FIX: January 30, 2009**
                    *All architectures*

                  Upon reception of an invalid update with 4-byte AS attributes, bgpd -
                  adhering to the RFCs - closed the session to the neighbor.
                  This error in the specification allowed 3rd parties to close remote BGP
                  sessions.
                  In the worst case Internet connectivity could be lost.

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/009_bgpd.patch)

                  * **010: RELIABILITY FIX: February 18, 2009**
                      *All architectures*

                    bgpd(8) did not correctly prepend its own AS to very long AS paths, causing
                    the process to terminate because of the resulting corrupt path.

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/010_bgpd.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: February 22, 2009**
                        *All architectures*

                      sudo(8) may allow a user listed in the sudoers file to run a command
                      as a different user than their access rule specifies when a Unix
                      group is used in the RunAs portion of the rule. The bug only manifests
                      when the user being granted privileges is also a member of the group
                      in the RunAs portion of the rule.

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/011_sudo.patch)

                      * **012: RELIABILITY FIX: April 8, 2009**
                          *All architectures*

                        The OpenSSL ASN.1 handling code could be forced to perform invalid memory
                        accesses through the use of certain invalid strings
                        ([CVE-2009-0590](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0590))
                        or under certain error conditions triggerable by invalid ASN.1 structures
                        ([CVE-2009-0789](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0789)).
                        These vulnerabilities could be exploited to achieve a
                        denial-of-service. A more detailed description of these problems is available
                        in the
                        [OpenSSL security advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20090325.txt), but note that the other issue described there "Incorrect Error
                        Checking During CMS verification" relates to code not enabled in OpenBSD.

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/012_openssl.patch)

                        * **013: RELIABILITY FIX: April 11, 2009**
                            *All architectures*

                          When pf attempts to perform translation on a specially crafted IP datagram,
                          a null pointer dereference will occur, resulting in a kernel panic.
                          In certain configurations this may be triggered by a remote attacker.

                          Restricting translation rules to protocols that are specific to the IP version
                          in use, is an effective workaround until the patch can be installed. As an
                          example, for IPv4 nat/binat/rdr rules you can use:
                          ```

                              nat/rdr ... inet proto { tcp udp icmp } ...

                          ```
                          Or for IPv6 nat/binat/rdr rules you can use:
                          ```

                              nat/rdr ... inet6 proto { tcp udp icmp6 } ...

                          ```
                          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/013_pf.patch)

### [Kaminsky's DNS Issue Accidentally Leaked?](http://blog.invisibledenizen.org/2008/07/kaminskys-dns-issue-accidentally-leaked.html)

[Update 2: Thomas Ptacek of Matasano has since posted a public apology to Dan et al for the accidental postage. [Regarding The Post On Chargen Earlier Today](http://www.matasano.com/log/1105/regarding-the-post-on-chargen-earlier-today/).]

[Update 1: Upon re-reading Halvar's explanation, it appears he got it closer than I originally thought, missing only the part about "bailiwick checking", which prevents a request for arbitrary.invisibledenizen.org from poisoning ns1.google.com. Halvar's solution, as written, would fail as I understand it. But one minor change (to using subdomains) makes it all function.]

It appears matasano [posted an explanation](http://www.matasano.com/log/1103/reliable-dns-forgery-in-2008-kaminskys-discovery/) of Dan Kaminsky's [DNS issue](http://securosis.com/2008/07/08/dan-kaminsky-discovers-fundamental-issue-in-dns-massive-multivendor-patch-released/) to their blog today, but looks like it may have been yanked back down. My google reader account nabbed it via the RSS feed while it was up.

It looks like maybe they had this typed up, ready to hit "post" as soon as someone else figured it out? They had advance knowledge of the issue via conference calls with Kaminsky, and when Halvar Flake [posted some speculation](http://addxorrol.blogspot.com/2008/07/on-dans-request-for-no-speculation.html) on what the issue was, they referred to Halvar's post and their explanation hit the matasano blog. But Halvar's speculation was not the full issue; only a re-hash of previously known issues. Halvar's ideas were close, but incomplete. Matasano filled in the missing details, possibly by accident. :)

Rather than re-post their entire section and get crossways with copyright complaints, here's a summary of their explanation:

1. There's a general principle of cryptography that says if you have to guess Variable A, it's incredibly helpful to be able to make as many iterations of variable A as possible. (See wikipedia's [entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack) on "birthday attack" or [google](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22birthday+attack%22) for more details.)
2. DNS only uses a random 16-bit transaction ID that must be guessed in order to poison a DNS server's cache, and it must be guessed before the legitimate answer comes back. This is difficult to do on any individual requests scale.
3. If you can slam a server with tons of requests, Point 1 above comes into play and allows you to reliably and quickly get at least 1 DNS cache poisoning packet to match the transaction ID. (Halvar's guess said this: force requests for random0000001.com, random0000002.com, etc, to generate a large amount of Variable A's. Eventually you'll guess one right.)
4. This is obviously not very helpful. So what if I can poison bankofamerica349543.com.
5. OK, so what about [DNS wildcards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record)? If you are able to poison random00001.invisibledenizen.org, what does that get you? Enter the [additional RR set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_cache_poisoning#Redirect_the_target_domain.27s_nameserver) field. This allows you to piggy back additional DNS responses in addition to what was requested. For security reasons, you can only respond with additional answers for addresses that match the same domain. (E.g., if I submit a request for arbitrary.domain.com, the additional response section can only return info for domain.com sub-domains.)
6. So the attack is this: do the above to cache poison randomXXXX.invisibledenizen.org, and in each packet have the additional RR return answers for ns1.invisibledenizen.org. Whenever random42156.invisibledenizen.org is the magical response that finds the transaction ID and poisons the cache, it will also poison the record for my nameserver, ns1.invisibledenizen.org.

Matasona stated this attack could occur in "less than 10 seconds" with current internet speeds.

Anyone want to throw together a metasploit aux module for this?

Could be wrong, but I don't think this is it. You shouldn't be able to send these extra RRs in your reply (at least they shouldn't be accepted). It also doesn't seem to match up with the little that Kaminsky has said about the bug so far.

Hello!

What is the NEW vulnerability? The birthday attack (easy to undergo for 16 bits, as key space is practically non-existent with the curent processing power, with 2at15 medium guesses for success), the multiple DNS querry and the extra RRs in the reply are not new!

@sergiu: The newness of the attack really boils down to utilizing subdomains instead of domain names. The initial cache poisoning attack used the additional RR sets to poison off-site/out-of-bailiwick records. E.g., a spoof for random234ds34.com would poison ns1.google.com

Dan realized (apparently, he's still mum on details until Black Hat) that you could get around bailiwick checking by using subdomains instead of domains.

It does sound like Dan's got some more exciting stuff to show during his talk, and at a minimum I'm interested in hearing his stories from working with so many different vendors -- that sounds like a nightmare.

@sergiu:
In the bad old days, if a recursive resolver requested the IP for yahoo.com, the DNS servers for yahoo could return results for microsoft.com as well, and the results would be accepted by the resolver.
They patched that, but poorly, so that a request for biteme.microsoft.com could also include the address for microsoft.com (or potentially www.microsoft.com, haven't verified the extent of the problem personally yet).
The upside is you get practically infinite chances to poison the cache instead of only one. That's a pretty big finding, and changes the nature of the game.
The new defense of port randomization only buys us a limited time, through an additional 15-16 bits of randomness, assuming the implementation didn't mess up the random number generator (like we have about 5 times before).
The real fix is DNSSEC (or potentially increasing the query ID to something like a 128-256 bit number).
DNSSEC is complex, perhaps hopelessly so, and roll out will take a while even when the TLDs support it.
Source port randomization at best moves the vulnerability back into the "known broken" class from it's newly discovered "broken by your grandmother" status.

I am wondering if this attack was used by NetDevilz back on 06.27.2008

http://tinyurl.com/693o5r

Timeline from that attack and Dan's find/announcement are peculiar.

Though i could be way off base.

@anon I don't think that was it, because it appears from the screenshot they actually changed the DNS servers names in the whois records. The attack we think Kaminsky found was one where they changed the IP address of the DNS server listed in the whois record and the core Internet DNS servers.

Thanks Natron and Steve for details!
My feeling is that a perfect RNG is not a solution, as the key space is limited at maximum 2@32 (if port randomization is enabled).
That's why I suppose that Steve's 128-256 bit number for TID will really put malicious hackers in the cryptanalysts position! A 256 bit key is practically impossible to brute-force with usual resources. However, this will "contribute" to more traffic used for DNS.
I hope that some brilliant DNS experts will find a solution on how to not allow the other half of the vulnerability: auxiliary RR for out-of-bailiwick records, because RNGs are not easy to implement in software.

So...for us neophytes who don't understand all this technobabble - basically, you can ask any DNS server to do a lookup for you. There is a transaction ID (16-bits) used for validation of the response. If you flood the DNS server with lookups for a domain by using subdomains that has a wildcard DNS entry, you have time to guess the transaction ID (16-bit = only 65,536 possibilities) and therefore spoof the response. The DNS server then saves the response until the time-to-live (TTL) expires.

Right?

It is my understanding that the root servers can't be spoofed. Those are specific IPs reserved exclusively for DNS. The only real way to guarantee a legitimate IP address is to do a full trace from the root server to the target DNS server that houses the domain. But that approach defeats the whole idea of decentralizing DNS.

Important sites like Google, Yahoo, etc. should be on some sort of special list with pre-determined IPs that are retrieved by ISPs from the root servers directly (and, in turn, all clients pull the list from the ISP). Basically, the top 500 sites that people visit plus whatever organizations that can afford some sort of significant fee to be on the list. That would solve the majority of this problem. The DNS to IP mapping then becomes read-only and should require something close to an "Act-Of-God" to change. This approach also helps solve another problem - what to do if DNS ever becomes unavailable (e.g. nuclear attack...assuming, of course, the Internet is still functional at that point)? I could build my own personal list but that seems like a lot of unnecessary work.

Then again, I only barely understand DNS. These are just a few things that have crossed my mind.

Package        : bind9
Vulnerability  : DNS cache poisoning
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1447
CERT advisory  : VU#800113

Dan Kaminsky discovered that properties inherent to the DNS protocol
lead to practical DNS cache poisoning attacks.  Among other things,
successful attacks can lead to misdirected web traffic and email
rerouting.

This update changes Debian's BIND 9 packages to implement the
recommended countermeasure: UDP query source port randomization.  This
change increases the size of the space from which an attacker has to
guess values in a backwards-compatible fashion and makes successful
attacks significantly more difficult.

Note that this security update changes BIND network behavior in a
fundamental way, and the following steps are recommended to ensure a
smooth upgrade.

1. Make sure that your network configuration is compatible with source
port randomization.  If you guard your resolver with a stateless packet
filter, you may need to make sure that no non-DNS services listen on on
the 1024--65535 UDP port range and open it at the packet filter.  For
instance, packet filters based on etch's Linux 2.6.18 kernel only
support stateless filtering of IPv6 packets, and are therefore pose this
additional difficulty.  (If you use IPv4 with iptables and ESTABLISHED
rules, networking changes are likely not required.)

2. Install the BIND 9 upgrade, using "apt-get update" followed by
"apt-get install bind9".  Verify that the named process has been
restarted and answers recursive queries.  (If all queries result in
timeouts, this indicates that networking changes are necessary; see the
first step.)

3. Verify that source port randomization is active.  Check that the
/var/log/daemon.log file does not contain messages of the following
form

  named[6106]: /etc/bind/named.conf.options:28: using specific
    query-source port suppresses port randomization and can be insecure.

right after the "listening on IPv6 interface" and "listening on IPv4
interface" messages logged by BIND upon startup.  If these messages are
present, you should remove the indicated lines from the configuration,
or replace the port numbers contained within them with "*" sign (e.g.,
replace "port 53" with "port *").

For additional certainty, use tcpdump or some other network monitoring
tool to check for varying UDP source ports.  If there is a NAT device
in front of your resolver, make sure that it does not defeat the
effect of source port randomization.

4. If you cannot activate source port randomization, consider
configuring BIND 9 to forward queries to a resolver which can, possibly
over a VPN such as OpenVPN to create the necessary trusted network link.
(Use BIND's forward-only mode in this case.)

Other caching resolvers distributed by Debian (PowerDNS, MaraDNS,
Unbound) already employ source port randomization, and no updated
packages are needed.  BIND 9.5 up to and including version
1:9.5.0.dfsg-4 only implements a weak form of source port
randomization and needs to be updated as well.  For information on
BIND 8, see DSA-1604-1, and for the status of the libc stub resolver,
see DSA-1605-1.

The updated bind9 packages contain changes originally scheduled for
the next stable point release, including the changed IP address of
L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET (Debian bug #449148).

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.3.4-2etch3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Exploit ID:     CAU-EX-2008-0003
Release Date:   2008.07.23
Title:          bailiwicked_domain.rb
Description:    Kaminsky DNS Cache Poisoning Flaw Exploit for Domains
Tested:         BIND 9.4.1-9.4.2
Attributes:     Remote, Poison, Resolver, Metasploit
Exploit URL:    http://www.caughq.org/exploits/CAU-EX-2008-0003.txt

===============/========================================================

Description
===========

This exploit targets a fairly ubiquitous flaw in DNS implementations
which allow the insertion of malicious DNS records into the cache of the
target nameserver.  This exploit caches a single malicious nameserver
entry into the target nameserver which replaces the legitimate
nameservers for the target domain.  By causing the target nameserver to
query for random hostnames at the target domain, the attacker can spoof
a response to the target server including an answer for the query, an
authority server record, and an additional record for that server,
causing target nameserver to insert the additional record into the
cache.  This insertion completely replaces the original nameserver
records for the target domain.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

More details about this issue may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1447   Here are the details from the Slackware 12.1 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/dnsmasq-2.45-i486-1_slack12.1.tgz:   Upgraded to dnsmasq-2.45.   It was discovered that earlier versions of dnsmasq have DNS cache   weaknesses that are similar to the ones recently discovered in BIND.   This new release minimizes the risk of cache poisoning.   For more information, see:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1447   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com?

Package        : python-dns
Vulnerability  : DNS response spoofing
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1447
Debian Bug     : 490217

Multiple weaknesses have been identified in PyDNS, a DNS client
implementation for the Python language.  Dan Kaminsky identified a
practical vector of DNS response spoofing and cache poisoning,
exploiting the limited entropy in a DNS transaction ID and lack of
UDP source port randomization in many DNS implementations.  Scott
Kitterman noted that python-dns is vulnerable to this predictability,
as it randomizes neither its transaction ID nor its source port.
Taken together, this lack of entropy leaves applications using
python-dns to perform DNS queries highly susceptible to response
forgery.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this
class of weakness as CVE-2008-1447.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3.0-5.2+etch1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-dns package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch
- -------------------------------

Debian (stable)
- ---------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1623-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
July 31, 2008                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : dnsmasq
Vulnerability  : DNS cache poisoning
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1447

Dan Kaminsky discovered that properties inherent to the DNS protocol
lead to practical DNS cache poisoning attacks. Among other things,
successful attacks can lead to misdirected web traffic and email
rerouting.

This update changes Debian's dnsmasq packages to implement the
recommended countermeasure: UDP query source port randomization. This
change increases the size of the space from which an attacker has to
guess values in a backwards-compatible fashion and makes successful
attacks significantly more difficult.

This update also switches the random number generator to Dan
Bernstein's SURF.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.35-1+etch4. Packages for alpha will be provided later.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.43-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dnsmasq package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch

Stable updates are available for amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Notes

```
glibc stub resolver relies on source port randomisation in kernel
Just a stub resolver Linux kernel provides source port randomisation
adns is not suitable to use with untrusted responses, documented in README.Debian
Source port randomization from Lenny kernel should provide sufficient protection
since this is just a Perl nodule for DNS queries and not a high-profile server app like
Bind, it's unlikely that a home-grown fix will provide an implementation of higher
cryptographical quality. Marking the version from Lenny as fixed, since Lenny includes
a kernel which provides source port randomization
Unbound, djbdns, pdnsd and PowerDNS are affected by the underlying protocol issue, but
already use source port randomization.
Marking non-caching stub resolvers as low since these really should be fixed,
but are much less vulnerable than a caching server.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

- * Allow the user to pick one of two ID randomization algorithms.
- *
- * The first algorithm is an adaptation of the sequence shuffling
- * algorithm discovered by Carter Bays and S. D. Durham [ACM Trans. Math.
- * Software 2 (1976), 59-64], as documented as Algorithm B in Chapter
- * 3.2.2 in Volume 2 of Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming".  We use
- * a randomly selected linear congruential random number generator with a
- * modulus of 2^16, whose increment is a randomly picked odd number, and
- * whose multiplier is picked from a set which meets the following
- * criteria:
- *     Is of the form 8*n+5, which ensures "high potency" according to
- *     principle iii in the summary chapter 3.6.  This form also has a
- *     gcd(a-1,m) of 4 which is good according to principle iv.
- *
- *     Is between 0.01 and 0.99 times the modulus as specified by
- *     principle iv.
- *
- *     Passes the spectral test "with flying colors" (ut >= 1) in
- *     dimensions 2 through 6 as calculated by Algorithm S in Chapter
- *     3.3.4 and the ratings calculated by formula 35 in section E.
- *
- *     Of the multipliers that pass this test, pick the set that is
- *     best according to the theoretical bounds of the serial
- *     correlation test.  This was calculated using a simplified
- *     version of Knuth's Theorem K in Chapter 3.3.3.
- *
- * These criteria may not be important for this use, but we might as well
- * pick from the best generators since there are so many possible ones and
- * we don't have that many random bits to do the picking.
- *
- * We use a modulus of 2^16 instead of something bigger so that we will
- * tend to cycle through all the possible IDs before repeating any,
- * however the shuffling will perturb this somewhat.  Theoretically there
- * is no minimimum interval between two uses of the same ID, but in
- * practice it seems to be >64000.
- *
- * Our adaptatation  of Algorithm B mixes the hash state which has
- * captured various random events into the shuffler to perturb the
- * sequence.
- *
- * One disadvantage of this algorithm is that if the generator parameters
- * were to be guessed, it would be possible to mount a limited brute force
- * attack on the ID space since the IDs are only shuffled within a limited
- * range.
- *
- * The second algorithm uses the same random number generator to populate
- * a pool of 65536 IDs.  The hash state is used to pick an ID from a window
- * of 4096 IDs in this pool, then the chosen ID is swapped with the ID
- * at the beginning of the window and the window position is advanced.
- * This means that the interval between uses of the ID will be no less
- * than 65536-4096.  The ID sequence in the pool will become more random
- * over time.
- *
- * For both algorithms, two more linear congruential random number generators
- * are selected.  The ID from the first part of algorithm is used to seed
- * the first of these generators, and its output is used to seed the second.
- * The strategy is use these generators as 1 to 1 hashes to obfuscate the
- * properties of the generator used in the first part of either algorithm.
- *
- * The first algorithm may be suitable for use in a client resolver since
- * its memory requirements are fairly low and it's pretty random out of
- * the box.  It is somewhat succeptible to a limited brute force attack,
- * so the second algorithm is probably preferable for a longer running
- * program that issues a large number of queries and has time to randomize
- * the pool.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Ruby: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200812-17**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ruby that allow for
attacks including arbitrary code execution and Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/ruby** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.8.6\_p287-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.8.6\_p287-r1** |

### Background

Ruby is an interpreted object-oriented programming language. The
elaborate standard library includes an HTTP server ("WEBRick") and a
class for XML parsing ("REXML").

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Ruby interpreter
and its standard libraries. Drew Yao of Apple Product Security
discovered the following flaws:

* Arbitrary code execution
  or Denial of Service (memory corruption) in the rb\_str\_buf\_append()
  function (CVE-2008-2662).
* Arbitrary code execution or Denial
  of Service (memory corruption) in the rb\_ary\_stor() function
  (CVE-2008-2663).
* Memory corruption via alloca in the
  rb\_str\_format() function (CVE-2008-2664).
* Memory corruption
  ("REALLOC\_N") in the rb\_ary\_splice() and rb\_ary\_replace() functions
  (CVE-2008-2725).
* Memory corruption ("beg + rlen") in the
  rb\_ary\_splice() and rb\_ary\_replace() functions (CVE-2008-2726).

Furthermore, several other vulnerabilities have been reported:

* Tanaka Akira reported an issue with resolv.rb that enables
  attackers to spoof DNS responses (CVE-2008-1447).
* Akira Tagoh
  of RedHat discovered a Denial of Service (crash) issue in the
  rb\_ary\_fill() function in array.c (CVE-2008-2376).
* Several
  safe level bypass vulnerabilities were discovered and reported by Keita
  Yamaguchi (CVE-2008-3655).
* Christian Neukirchen is credited
  for discovering a Denial of Service (CPU consumption) attack in the
  WEBRick HTTP server (CVE-2008-3656).
* A fault in the dl module
  allowed the circumvention of taintness checks which could possibly lead
  to insecure code execution was reported by "sheepman"
  (CVE-2008-3657).
* Tanaka Akira again found a DNS spoofing
  vulnerability caused by the resolv.rb implementation using poor
  randomness (CVE-2008-3905).
* Luka Treiber and Mitja Kolsek
  (ACROS Security) disclosed a Denial of Service (CPU consumption)
  vulnerability in the REXML module when dealing with recursive entity
  expansion (CVE-2008-3790).

### Impact

These vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code,
spoof DNS responses, bypass Ruby's built-in security and taintness
checks, and cause a Denial of Service via crash or CPU exhaustion.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Ruby users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/ruby-1.8.6_p287-r1"
```

Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: SECURITY FIX: October 8, 2007**
    *All architectures*

  Malicious DHCP clients could cause dhcpd(8) to corrupt its stack

  A DHCP client that claimed to require a maximum message size less than
  the minimum IP MTU could cause dhcpd(8) to overwrite stack memory.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/001_dhcpd.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: October 10, 2007**
      *All architectures*

    The SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function in OpenSSL contains an off-by-one overflow.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/002_openssl.patch)

    * **003: CD BOOT FAILURE ON OLDER COMPUTERS : October 30, 2007**
        *i386 only*

      Some older BIOSes are unable to boot CD1 (ie. the commercial release sold
      by the project, not the CD images available on the net).
      A workaround using CD2 (amd64 architecture) is as follows.
      (An amd64 machine is *NOT* required for this to work.)

      1. Insert CD2 and tell your computer to boot it;
         * When the `boot>` prompt appears, stop the automatic boot
           by pressing the space bar;
           * Remove CD2 and insert CD1;
             * Erase the character you typed to stop the boot, type

               `boot /4.2/i386/bsd.rd`

               then press *Enter*.

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: November 27, 2007**
          *All architectures*

        A memory leak in pf can lead to machine lockups.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/004_pf.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: January 11, 2008**
            *All architectures*

          A missing NULL pointer check can lead to a kernel panic.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/005_ifrtlabel.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: February 8, 2008**
              *All architectures*

                  * **010: SECURITY FIX: March 30, 2008**
                      *All architectures*

                    sshd(8) would execute ~/.ssh/rc even when a sshd\_config(5) *ForceCommand*
                    directive was in effect, allowing users with write access to this file to
                    execute arbitrary commands. This behaviour was documented, but was an unsafe
                    default and an extra hassle for administrators.

                          **2nd revision, July 23, 2008**

                          A vulnerability has been found with BIND. An attacker could use this vulnerability
                          to poison the cache of a recursive resolving name server.
                          [CVE-2008-1447](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1447).

                          * **014: RELIABILITY FIX: July 29, 2008**
                              *All architectures*

                            Some kinds of IPv6 usage would leak kernel memory (in particular, this path
                            was exercised by the named(8) patch for port randomization). Since INET6 is
                            enabled by default, this condition affects all systems.

                            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/014_pcb.patch)

                            * **015: SECURITY FIX: October 2, 2008**
                                *All architectures*

                              The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ndp) did not correctly verify neighbor
                              solicitation requests maybe allowing a nearby attacker to intercept traffic.
                              The attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for
                              this vulnerability to be exploited.
                              [CVE-2008-2476](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2476).

This is revision 2 of this patch (compared the previous patch, it
removes a noisy log message that was a side effect of the privsep
we added to our version of BIND.
Apply by doing:
cd /usr/src
patch -p0 < 013\_bind.patch
Then rebuild and install bind:
cd usr.sbin/bind
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper obj
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

additional features
- write pid-file before chroot
- privilege separation for binding to privileged ports from within chroot
-- add LCG (Linear Congruential Generator) implementation to libisc
-- use LCG instead of LFSR for ID generation until LFSR is proven reliable
+- add 64K entry shuffle (somewhat like Fisher-Yates) implementation to libisc
+- use shuffle instead of LFSR for ID generation
- strlcpy/strlcat/snprintf fixes
default parameter changes

# VMware Player, Server, Workstation: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation, allowing remote and local attackers to conduct several
attacks, including privilege escalation, remote execution of arbitrary
code, and a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-player** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-workstation** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **6.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-server** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0.9.156507** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

VMware Player, Server, and Workstation allow emulation of a complete PC
on a PC without the usual performance overhead of most emulators.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

Local users may be able to gain escalated privileges, cause a Denial of
Service, or gain sensitive information.

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code, or a Denial
of Service. Remote attackers also may be able to spoof DNS traffic, read
arbitrary files, or inject arbitrary web script to the VMware Server
Console.

Furthermore, guest OS users may be able to execute arbitrary code on the
host OS, gain escalated privileges on the guest OS, or cause a Denial of
Service (crash the host OS).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Player. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Player:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-player"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
“>=app-emulation/vmware-player-3.1.5”, however these packages are
not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Workstation. We recommend that
users unmerge VMware Workstation:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-workstation"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
“>=app-emulation/vmware-workstation-7.1.5”, however these packages
are not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Server. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Server:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-server"

```

To learn about other Security Updates, see "[Apple Security Updates](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61798)."

#### iPhone v2.1

* **Application Sandbox**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3631

  Available for: iPhone v2.0 through v2.0.2

  Impact: An application may be able to read another application's files

  Description: The Application Sandbox does not properly enforce access restrictions between third-party applications. This may allow a third-party application to read files in another third-party application's sandbox, and lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by enforcing the proper access restrictions between application sandboxes. Credit to Nicolas Seriot of Sen:te and Bryce Cogswell for reporting this issue. This issue does not affect iPhone versions prior to v2.0.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-1806, CVE-2008-1807, CVE-2008-1808

  Available for: iPhone v1.0 through v2.0.2

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in FreeType v2.3.5

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in FreeType v2.3.5, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution when accessing maliciously crafted font data. This update addresses the issue by incorporating the security fixes from version 2.3.6 of FreeType. Further information is available via the FreeType site at <http://www.freetype.org/>

* **mDNSResponder**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-1447

  Available for: iPhone v1.0 through v2.0.2

  Impact: mDNSResponder is susceptible to DNS cache poisoning and may return forged information

  Description: mDNSResponder provides translation between host names and IP addresses for applications that use its unicast DNS resolution API. A weakness in the DNS protocol may allow a remote attacker to perform DNS cache poisoning attacks. As a result, applications that rely on mDNSResponder for DNS may receive forged information. This update addresses the issue by implementing source port and transaction ID randomization to improve resilience against cache poisoning attacks. Credit to Dan Kaminsky of IOActive for reporting this issue.

* **Networking**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3612

  Available for: iPhone v1.0 through v2.0.2

  Impact: Predictable TCP initial sequence numbers generation may lead to TCP spoofing or session hijacking

  Description: TCP initial sequence numbers are sequentially generated. Predictable initial sequence numbers may allow a remote attacker to create a spoofed TCP connection or insert data into an existing TCP connection. This update addresses the issue by generating random TCP initial sequence numbers.

* **Passcode Lock**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3633

  Available for: iPhone v2.0 through v2.0.2

  Impact: An unauthorized user may bypass the Passcode Lock and launch iPhone applications

  Description: The Passcode Lock feature is designed to prevent applications from being launched unless the correct passcode is entered. An implementation issue in the handling of emergency calls allows users with physical access to an iPhone to launch an application without the passcode by double clicking the home button in emergency call. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of emergency calls. Credit to Matthew Yohe of The University of Iowa's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering for reporting this issue. This issue does not affect iPhone versions prior to v2.0.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3632

  Available for: iPhone v1.0 through v2.0.2

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A use-after-free issue exists in WebKit's handling of CSS import statements. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of document references.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-08:06.bind Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: DNS cache poisoning
Category: contrib
Module: bind
Announced: 2008-07-13
Credits: Dan Kaminsky
Affects: All supported FreeBSD versions.
Corrected: 2008-07-12 10:07:33 UTC (RELENG\_6, 6.3-STABLE)
2008-07-13 18:42:38 UTC (RELENG\_6\_3, 6.3-RELEASE-p3)
2008-07-13 18:42:38 UTC (RELENG\_7, 7.0-STABLE)
2008-07-13 18:42:38 UTC (RELENG\_7\_0, 7.0-RELEASE-p3)
CVE Name: CVE-2008-1447
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
BIND 9 is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.
The named(8) daemon is an Internet Domain Name Server. DNS requests
contain a query id which is used to match a DNS request with the response
and to make it harder for anybody but the DNS server which received the
request to send a valid response.
II. Problem Description
The BIND DNS implementation does not randomize the UDP source port when
doing remote queries, and the query id alone does not provide adequate
randomization.
III. Impact
The lack of source port randomization reduces the amount of data the
attacker needs to guess in order to successfully execute a DNS cache
poisoning attack. This allows the attacker to influence or control
the results of DNS queries being returned to users from target systems.
IV. Workaround
Limiting the group of machines that can do recursive queries on the DNS
server will make it more difficult, but not impossible, for this
vulnerability to be exploited.
To limit the machines able to perform recursive queries, add an ACL in
named.conf and limit recursion like the following:
acl example-acl {
192.0.2.0/24;
};
options {
recursion yes;
allow-recursion { example-acl; };
};
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 6-STABLE or 7-STABLE, or to the
RELENG\_7\_0 or RELENG\_6\_3 security branch dated after the correction
date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 6.3 and
7.0 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 6.3]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:06/bind63.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:06/bind63.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 7.0]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:06/bind7.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:06/bind7.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/lib/bind
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/named
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
NOTE WELL: This update causes BIND to choose a new, random UDP port for
each new query; this may cause problems for some network configurations,
particularly if firewall(s) block incoming UDP packets on particular
ports. The avoid-v4-udp-ports and avoid-v6-udp-ports options should be
used to avoid selecting random port numbers within a blocked range.
NOTE WELL: If a port number is specified via the query-source or
query-source-v6 options to BIND, randomized port selection will not be
used. Consequently it is strongly recommended that these options not
be used to specify fixed port numbers.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [dnsmasq](/security/cves?package=dnsmasq) -

## Details

Dan Kaminsky discovered weaknesses in the DNS protocol as implemented

by Dnsmasq. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof DNS entries

and poison DNS caches. Among other things, this could lead to

misdirected email and web traffic.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [dnsmasq-base](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dnsmasq)
  -
  [2.41-2ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dnsmasq/2.41-2ubuntu2.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Dnsmasq to effect

the necessary changes.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1604-1                  security@debian.org

Package        : bind
Vulnerability  : DNS cache poisoning
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1447
CERT advisory  : VU#800113

Dan Kaminsky discovered that properties inherent to the DNS protocol
lead to practical DNS cache poisoning attacks.  Among other things,
successful attacks can lead to misdirected web traffic and email
rerouting.

The BIND 8 legacy code base could not be updated to include the
recommended countermeasure (source port randomization, see DSA-1603-1
for details).  There are two ways to deal with this situation:

1. Upgrade to BIND 9 (or another implementation with source port
randomization).  The documentation included with BIND 9 contains a
migration guide.

2. Configure the BIND 8 resolver to forward queries to a BIND 9
resolver.  Provided that the network between both resolvers is trusted,
this protects the BIND 8 resolver from cache poisoning attacks (to the
same degree that the BIND 9 resolver is protected).

This problem does not apply to BIND 8 when used exclusively as an
authoritative DNS server.  It is theoretically possible to safely use
BIND 8 in this way, but updating to BIND 9 is strongly recommended.
BIND 8 (that is, the bind package) will be removed from the etch
distribution in a future point release.

##### 3. Problem Description

I Security Issues

a. Setting ActiveX killbit
Starting from this release, VMware has set the killbit on its
ActiveX controls. Setting the killbit ensures that ActiveX
controls cannot run in Internet Explorer (IE), and avoids
Microsoft KB article 240797 and the related references on this
topic.
Security vulnerabilities have been reported for ActiveX controls
provided by VMware when run in IE. Under specific circumstances,
exploitation of these ActiveX controls might result in denial-of-
service or can allow running of arbitrary code when the user
browses a malicious Web site or opens a malicious file in IE
browser. An attempt to run unsafe ActiveX controls in IE might
result in pop-up windows warning the user.
Note: IE can be configured to run unsafe ActiveX controls without
prompting. VMware recommends that you retain the default
settings in IE, which prompts when unsafe actions are
requested.
Earlier, VMware had issued knowledge base articles, KB 5965318 and
KB 9078920 on security issues with ActiveX controls. To avoid
malicious scripts that exploit ActiveX controls, do not enable
unsafe ActiveX objects in your browser settings. As a best
practice, do not browse untrusted Web sites as an administrator
and do not click OK or Yes if prompted by IE to allow certain
actions.
VMware would like to thank Julien Bachmann, Shennan Wang, Shinnai,
and Michal Bucko for reporting these issues to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2008-3691, CVE-2008-3692,
CVE-2008-3693, CVE-2008-3694, CVE-2008-3695, CVE-2007-5438, and
CVE-2008-3696 to the security issues with VMware ActiveX controls.

b. VMware ISAPI Extension Denial of Service

The Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) is
an API that extends the functionality of Internet Information
Server (IIS). VMware uses ISAPI extensions in its Server product.
One of the ISAPI extensions provided by VMware is vulnerable to a
remote denial of service. By sending a malformed request, IIS
might shut down. IIS 6.0 restarts automatically. However, IIS 5.0
does not restart automatically when its Startup Type is set to Manual.
VMware would like to thank the Juniper Networks J-Security
Security Research Team for reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-3697 to this issue.

f. VMware Consolidated Backup (VCB) command-line utilities may expose sensitive information

VMware Consolidated Backup command-line utilities accept the user
password through the -p command-line option. Users logged into the
ESX service console or into the system that runs VCB could gain
access to the username and password used by VCB command-line
utilities
when such commands are running.
The ESX patch and the new version of VCB resolve this issue by
providing an alternative way of passing the password used by VCB
command-line utilities.
VCB in ESX
----------
The following options are recommended for passing the password:
1. The password is specified in /etc/backuptools.conf
(PASSWORD=xxxxx), and -p is not used in the command line.
/etc/backuptools.conf file permissions are read/write only
for root.
2. No password is specified in /etc/backuptools.conf and the
-p option is not used in the command line. The user will be
prompted to enter a password.
ESX is not affected unless you use VCB.
Stand-alone VCB
---------------
The following options are recommended for passing the password:
1. The password is specified in config.js (PASSWORD=xxxxx), and -p
is not used in the command line. The file permissions on config.js
are read/write only for the administrator. The config.js file is
located in folder "config" of the VCB installation folder. For
example,
C:\Program Files\Vmware\Vmware Consolidated Backup Framework\config.
2. The password is specified in the registry, and is not specified in
config.js, and -p is not used in the command line. Access to the
registry key holding the password is allowed only to the
administrator.
The location of the registry key is:
On Windows x86: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\VMware, Inc.\
VMware Consolidated Backup\Password
On Windows x64: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\
VMware, Inc.\VMware Consolidated Backup\Password
3. The password is not specified in the registry, and is not
specified in
config.js, and -p is not used in the command line. The user will be
prompted to enter a password.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-2101 to this issue.

g. Third Party Library libpng Updated to 1.2.29

Several flaws were discovered in the way third party library
libpng handled various PNG image chunks. An attacker could
create a carefully crafted PNG image file in such a way that
it causes an application linked with libpng to crash when the
file is manipulated.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2007-5269 to this issue.
NOTE: There are multiple patches required to remediate the issue.

##### II ESX Service Console rpm updates

a. update to bind

This update upgrades the service console rpms for bind-utils and
bind-lib to version 9.2.4-22.el3.
Version 9.2.4.-22.el3 addresses the recently discovered
vulnerability in the BIND software used for Domain Name
resolution (DNS). VMware doesn't install all the BIND packages
on ESX Server and is not vulnerable by default to the reported
vulnerability. Of the BIND packages, VMware only ships bind-util
and bind-lib in the service console and these components by
themselves cannot be used to setup a DNS server. Bind-lib and
bind-util are used in client DNS applications like nsupdate,
nslookup, etc.
VMware explicitly discourages installing applications like BIND
on the service console. In case the customer has installed BIND,
and the DNS server is configured to support recursive queries,
their ESX Server system is affected and they should replace BIND
with a patched version.
Note: ESX Server will use the DNS server on the network it is
on, so it is important to patch that DNS server.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-1447 to this issue.

[![Dan Kaminsky - guilty grin](../images/dan-kaminsky.gif)](http://doxpara.com)

The big security news of Summer 2008 has been [Dan
Kaminsky's](http://www.doxpara.com/) discovery of a [serious
vulnerability in DNS](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113). This vulnerability could allow an attacker to redirect
network clients to alternate servers of his own choosing, presumably for ill ends.

This all led to a mad dash to patch DNS servers worldwide, and though there have
been many writeups of just how the vulnerability manifests itself, we felt the need
for one in far more detail. Hence, one of our Illustrated Guides.

This paper covers how DNS works: first at a high level, then by picking
apart an individual packet exchange field by field. Next, we'll use this knowledge
to see how weaknesses in common implementations can lead to cache poisoning.

By fully understanding the issues at play, the reader may be better equipped
to mitigate the risks in his or her own environment.

We hope everybody who runs a DNS server patches soon.

# Terminology

Before we see how DNS operates, we need to define a few terms to know
who the players are, software-wise. This will be review for many, and
in some cases we leave out side details that an expert would find
fault with. Omitted details won't matter for an understanding of this
issue.

 zone
Think of this as a "domain": a collection of hostnames/IP pairs
all managed together.

Our servers operate **unixwiz.net**, and all the DNS records that
go with it — **www.unixwiz.net**, **mvp.unixwiz.net**,
**cs.unixwiz.net**, etc. — are all part of the **unixwiz.net** zone.

The subtle distinction comes with subdomains: sometimes they are part
of the main zone, sometimes they are a separate zone, but none of that
matters for this paper.

 Nameserver
This is server software that answers DNS questions, such as "What is the
IP address for www.unixwiz.net?". Sometimes a nameserver knows the answer
directly (if it's "authoritative" for the zone), other times it has to
go out to the internet and ask around to find the answer (if it's a recursive
nameserver).

There is wide variety of software that performs this service:
[BIND](http://www.isc.org/sw/bind/),
[PowerDNS](http://www.powerdns.com/),
[djbdns](http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html),
and many others. They all answer the same questions more or less
the same way, though the minor differences matter some for this paper.

 Authoritative Nameserver
For every zone, *somebody* has to maintain a file of the hostnames and
IP address associations ("linux.unixwiz.net is 64.170.162.98", and so on).
This is generally an administrative function performed by a human, and in
most cases **one** machine has this file. It's the zone master.

Zones with multiple public nameservers make administrative
arrangements to transfer the zone data automatically to additional slave
nameservers, all of which are authoritative as far as the outside world is concerned.
The distinction between master and slave is unimportant for this paper.

 Resolver
 This is the client part of the DNS client/server system: it **asks the questions**
about hostnames. The resolver is usually a small library compiled into
each program that requires DNS services, and it knows just enough to send questions
to a nearby nameserver.

On Linux/UNIX systems, the location of the servers-to-ask is found in the file
**/etc/resolv.conf**, and on Windows it's part of the Network Connections setup
in the control panel. This usually consists of a list of IP addresses, each of
which expects to find a nameserver on the other end.

Resolvers are usually very small and dumb, relying on the servers to do the
heavy lifting.

 Recursive Nameserver
 This is a nameserver that's willing to go out on the internet and find
the results for zones it's not authoritative for, as a service to its clients.
Not all nameservers are configured to provide recursive service, or are limited
to just trusted clients (say, an ISP may provide nameservice only to its
customers).

 Resource Record
 Though most think of DNS as providing hostname-to-IP mapping, there are
actually other kinds of questions we can ask of a nameserver, and this highlights
the notion that DNS is really a database of "resource records".

The most common type is an IP Address (an "A" record), but other records
exist too: NS (nameserver), MX (mail exchanger), SOA (Start of Authority),
and so on.

 Delegation
When a nameserver doesn't have the contents of a zone, but knows how to
find the owner, it's said to **delegate** service of that zone to another
nameserver. Informally, it's a pass-the-buck mechanism: "I know the zone
you're asking about, go ask (hostname) for the details".

# Following a simple DNS query

![DNS query logo - ping](../images/dns-lookup-logo.gif)

With a few key terms defined, we'll review how a simple recursive query works
in the absence of any bugs or shenanigans; this forms the background of where
the exploits can later be applied.

Though the DNS packet itself has many fields (each of which is important), we're
omitting that detail for now in order to understand the high level flow of a full
query, from top to bottom. Visualizing how delegation bounces requests from one
server to another is vital to understanding the vulnerability will be exploited later.

We can't really tell by looking at the query itself what prompted the query
in the first place. In the logo of this section, we see that the user attempted
to ping our webserver, and the **ping** program asked the nameserver to perform
this name-to-IP lookup.

But it could have just as easily been a user entering **http://www.unixwiz.net**
in a browser address bar. But it's not important to know **why** the name's being
looked up, only to know **how** it looks up.

| 1 | The client (noted as "User's PC") makes a request for **www.unixwiz.net**, and it's routed to the nameserver provided by the user's ISP. It requests the **A record**, which represents an IP address.  The ISP's nameserver knows that it's not authoritative for **unixwiz.net**, so it can't look it up in its local zone database. It also doesn't find the name it its cache of recently-seen data, so it knows it has to go out to the internet to find it for us. | DNS resolution, step 1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | All recursive nameservers are preconfigured with a list of 13 root servers, a selection of which looks like: Root hints ```  A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.  IN  A  198.41.0.4 B.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.  IN  A  192.228.79.201 C.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.  IN  A  192.33.4.12 ... M.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.  IN  A  202.12.27.33  ```  Thankfully these IP addresses don't change very often.  The nameserver picks one at random and sends off the query for the A record of **www.unixwiz.net**; here it's going to **b.root-servers.net** | DNS resolution, steps 2 and 3 |
| 3 | The root server doesn't know anything about **unixwiz.net**, but is happy to send me the way of the Global Top Level Domain (GTLD) servers responsible for the **.net** domain. This is in the form of **NS** records of servers more qualified to answer our query: "Go ask these guys - here's a list". .NET referrals ```  /* Authority section */ NET.                 IN  NS A.GTLD-SERVERS.NET.                      IN  NS B.GTLD-SERVERS.NET.                      IN  NS C.GTLD-SERVERS.NET.                      ...                      IN  NS M.GTLD-SERVERS.NET.  /* Additional section - "glue" records */ A.GTLD-SERVERS.net.  IN  A  192.5.6.30 B.GTLD-SERVERS.net.  IN  A  192.33.14.30 C.GTLD-SERVERS.net.  IN  A  192.26.92.30 ... M.GTLD-SERVERS.net.  IN  A  192.55.83.30  ```  Though technically we asked only for the **NS** records, the root servers also give us the IP address of each: this is known as "glue" and is provided to save us from having to look it up. |
| 4 | With the helpful referral from the root servers, this nameserver chooses one of the authoritative servers at random — here, **c.gtld-servers.net** — and sends off the same query: "I was told to ask you: what's the A record for **www.unixwiz.net**?". | DNS Resolution, steps 5 and 6 |
| 5 | The GTLD server doesn't know the specific answer to our query, but it does know how to get us closer. Like the root servers, it sends back a referral (a set of **NS** records) that are likely to have what we seek. unixwiz.net referral ```  /* Authority section */ unixwiz.net.        IN  NS cs.unixwiz.net.                     IN  NS linux.unixwiz.net.  /* Additional section - "glue" records */ cs.unixwiz.net.     IN  A  8.7.25.94 linux.unixwiz.net.  IN  A  64.170.162.98  ``` |
| 6 | Once again the recursive nameserver is following a chain of referrals on the client's behalf, and it picks one of the nameservers at random and sends off a third query (the same as the other two). | DNS resolution, steps 7 and 7 |
| 7 | Unlike the other answers, that merely passed the buck onto other nameservers, **this** one actually has what we were looking for: it provides the **A record** for **www.unixwiz.net**.  In addition, the response includes a flag saying "This is an authoritative response", indicating it came from the source of truth for this domain. |
| 8 | Now with answer in hand, the ISP's recursive nameserver hands that answer back to the client, and that satisfies the entire query.  The recursive nameserver also files away this answer into its own cache in case this or some other client makes the same query later.  But we'll note that the reply to the client doesn't include the "authoritative" indicator. Even though it received one from cs.unixwiz.net, the recursive nameserver can't pretend to the client that it's actually the source of authority, so it's considered a non-authoritative answer. | DNS resolution, steps 7 and 7 |

This procedure goes on under the hood trillions of time every day over the
internet. DNS is quite fast, so the eight-packet handshake (for this particular
query) routinely completes in just a split second.

This reveals the distributed nature of DNS: no one machine knows everything,
but they do know how to find each other via delegation.

As a side note, nothing prevents any nameserver from hosting any zone, including
those it doesn't really own. A bad guy could set up a nameserver and configure
an authoritative zone for **BankOfSteve.com**, but it has no effect because
no higher-level nameserver ever delegates to it.

# What's in a DNS packet?

With a grasp of the high-level exchanges we dig a bit deeper into what's
inside a DNS packet: the details are required to understand cache poisoning
and this recent vulnerability. There's a lot of detail here, but fortunately
many of the fields aren't important for an understanding of these issues.

The illustration on the right shows the overall structure of a single packet
of DNS data, and it can reflect a question packet or an answer packet. We've
highlighted some of the fields that are most related to this exploit.

![regular DNS packet](../images/dns-query-packet.gif)
 Source / Destination IP address
 These reflect the IP addresses of the machines that sent and
should receive the packet. It's possible to **forge** the source
address, but pointless to forge the destination.

Analog in the real world: on an envelope sent in the US Mail, you can put
anything you want as the return address — the source address —
but if you lie about the recipient, it's not going to go where you want.

 Source / Destination port numbers
DNS servers listen on port 53/udp for queries from the outside world,
so the first packet of any exchange always includes 53 as the UDP destination
port.

The source port varies considerably (though not enough, as we'll find
shortly): sometimes it's also port 53/udp, sometimes it's a fixed port chosen
at random by the operating system, and sometimes it's just a random port
that changes every time.

As far as DNS functionality is concerned, the source port doesn't really matter
as long as the replies get routed to it properly. But this turns out to be
the crux of the problem at hand.

 Query ID
 This is a unique identifier created in the query packet that's left
intact by the server sending the reply: it allows the server making the
request to associate the answer with the question.

A nameserver might have many queries outstanding at one time — even multiple
queries to the same server — so this Query ID helps match the answers
with the awaiting questions.

This is also sometimes called the Transaction ID (TXID).

 QR (Query / Response)
Set to **0** for a query by a client, **1** for a response from a server.

 Opcode
 Set by client to **0** for a standard query; the other types
aren't used in our examples.
 AA (Authoritative Answer)
 Set to **1** in a server response if this answer is Authoritative, **0** if not.
 TC (Truncated)
 Set to **1** in a server response if the answer can't fit in the 512-byte limit of
a UDP packet response; this means the client will need to try again with a TCP query,
which doesn't have the same limits.

 RD (Recursion Desired)
 The client sets this to **1** if it wishes that the server will perform the
entire lookup of the name recursively, or **0** if it just wants the best information
the server has and the client will continue with the iterative query on its own. Not all
nameservers will honor a recursive request (root servers, for instance, won't ever perform
recursive queries).

 RA (Recursion Available)
 The server sets this to indicate that it will (**1**) or won't (**0**)
support recursion.

 Z — reserved
 This is reserved and must be zero
 rcode
 Response code from the server: indicates success or failure
 Question record count
The client fills in the next section with a single "question" record that specifies
what it's looking for: it includes the name (**www.unixwiz.net**), the type
(**A**, **NS**, **MX**, etc.), and the class (virtually always
**IN**=Internet).

The server repeats the question in the response packet, so the question count is
almost always **1**.

 Answer/authority/additional record count
Set by the server, these provide various kinds of answers to the query
from the client: we'll dig into these answers shortly.

 DNS Question/Answer data
This is the area that holds the question/answer data referenced by the count
fields above. These will be discussed in great detail later.

We'll see these in action as we disassemble our sample query shortly.

# Resource Record Types

[![DNS Types logo](../images/dns-types-logo.gif)](http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/rr.html)

Ultimately, DNS is a kind of distributed database, and each query or response
includes a name, a type, and (for a response) a value. The resource types
represent different purposes, and no understanding of DNS is complete without
knowing about them.

There are dozens of resource record types, though only a few are in common
usage. The rest are experimental, obsolete, or serve obscure purposes that
rarely come up in practice.

 Common DNS Resource Record Types
| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| A | This is an **IP Address** record, and is the most obvious type of data supported by DNS. Indeed; many users have no idea that DNS deals with anything other than IP addresses. |
| NS | This describes a **Nameserver** record responsible for the domain asked about. |
| MX | The MX record encodes the name of a **Mail Exchanger**, a system responsible for handling email for the given domain. Multiple MX records can be provided for a domain (they included way to specify priority). Email server software is the main consumer of **MX** resource records.  Curiously, the mail exchanger for a domain doesn't have to be part of that domain; it's common for the mailserver at a large hosting operation to be primary MX for thousands of customer domains. |
| SOA | The **Start of Authorities** record describes some key data about the zone as defined by the zone administrator (on the domain master machine). It includes things such as the contact address for the admin, and the amount of time that slave nameservers should hang onto the zone in case the master is unreachable. |
| CNAME | The **Canonical Name**, more commonly known as an **Alias**, this allows providing an alternate name for a resource. |
| TXT | A generic **Text** record that provides descriptive data about domain. These are essentially comments, though some applications use them for programmatic purposes. |

It's generally (but not universally) allowed that one name can have multiple resource records,
even more than one of the same type. A common example would be a machine
having multiple IP addresses, both of which are entered in DNS:

```

www.example.com. IN A 192.168.1.3
www.example.com. IN A 192.168.7.149

```

Here, the name **www.example.com** has two IP address records associated
with it, and both will be returned in answer to an **A** query
for this name. Note that the order of the addresses as they appear in
the file are not maintained in the responses: they're usually shuffled.

We'll note that the **IN** token means the **INternet** class, and this
is virtually the only class you'll ever see in practice. Others (such as
Chaos or Hesiod) are defined but are for specialized and mostly obsolete
purposes.

# Drilling down to a real query

![Steps 4..7](../images/dns-4packets-logo.gif)

Recalling our query exchange above, we're going to study steps 4 through 7 in
some detail: they are most representative of the DNS name-resolution process
without adding duplicative steps.

Ultimately, DNS is a kind of distributed database, and it can look up much
more than just an IP address: there are multiple **resource record** types
involved in a query, and one can't understand the packet structure without
knowing their distinctions.

We'll note that not every detail is predictable even when the protocol
is fully understood: nameservers have some latitude in how they accomplish a
resolution, so a few alternatives are available. We're just choosing one common
path through this process.

In this example, we're using the nameserver of our own ISP — **dnsr1.sbcglobal.net**
— (referred to as **dnsr1**) as the local recursive nameserver, and we'll
find a few things in common for all of them.

 Contrived Data!

In this example we're showing a hypothetical packet trace for our own ISP's
recursive nameserver, but this is a **made-up example**.

We certainly have no way to actually sniff the real traffic coming and
going from **their** server, but we'll note that as of this writing,
AT&T had patched this server to avoid this vulnerability.

* In every case, the Question section is the same: "What is the A
  record for **www.unixwiz.net**?". This question is also repeated
  in the answer — mainly as a convenience — so it's seen in
  common in every packet we look at.
* The ISP's nameserver usually sets the **RD=1** flag (Recursion Desired) on the
  odd chance that the other end is willing to do the heavy lifting and go find
  this answer for us. Most top-level nameservers are unwilling to do this, so they
  give us the best information they have and set **RA=0** flag (Recursion Unavailable)
  to let us know that we have to do the work ourselves.
* In this example, the source UDP port number for all queries from
  our ISP's nameserver is the same. It's a common practice for nameserver
  software to request a random port from the operating system at startup,
  then use it for every query.
* We observe that the Query ID increments by one each time it sends
  a new query.

So with this information in hand, let's walk through the steps in detail and
see how our "simple" query is actually resolved.

| 2&3 | In this step our ISP's nameserver queried a root server for **www.unixwiz.net**, and it replied with a list of global top-level domain servers that knew about the **.net** hierarchy. From this delegation, the ISP's nameserver chose one at random (**c.gtld-servers.net**), as shown in step 4. | (not illustrated) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4   client to server | The **dnsr1** server at our ISP grabs one of the GTLD nameservers received from a root server (in step 3) and fires off a second query. This is essentially the same as the first; the Question is about the **A record** www.unixwiz.net.  Because this is a **query** — not a **response** — the answer/authorities/additional records fields are blank (as shown with a count of zero).  The **Query ID** value was taken as the next ID available from this server's internal counter. | DNS Packet, Step 4 |
| 5   server to client | The GTLD server we asked doesn't know the specific answer to our question, but it knows where to ask: it responds with a series of **NS** records that should know how to handle our request. They show up in the Authorities section as **cs.unixwiz.net** and **linux.unixwiz.net**.  We're given hostnames of the nameservers we ought to contact, but real network connections are only made by IP address: how do we look these up? Avoiding what would clearly be a chicken-and-egg problem, the GTLD nameserver provides not only the hostnames of the authoritative servers, but **their IP addresses too**.  These are provided as **A** records in the "Additional Records" section, and are known as "glue data".  Because this nameserver can't give us the final answer, it sets the **AA=0** flag (Authoritative Answer) to zero, indicating that somebody else knows the real story and we have to keep asking around.  But a related note: **dnsr1** is a very busy nameserver, having perhaps hundreds of queries outstanding every second. How does it know that this reply packet is a response to that specific pending request?  The answer is: by matching on the **Query ID**. Inbound DNS packets that don't have a waiting Query ID are ignored.  The TTL is a **Time To Live**, discussed later. | DNS Packet, Step 5 |
| 6   client to server | In step 5 we received two nameservers that are purported to know more about the **unixwiz.net** domain, so one more query is created that asks the same question — again! — of these just-learned nameservers.  This request is really no different from the previous queries, though it does increment the Query ID by one before sending it off. The idea is that we keep following these delegations until we actually get a **real** answer, not a referral. | DNS Packet, Step 6 |
| 7   server to client | And at last the answer comes!  Unlike the previous replies, this one has **answer count=1**, and it carries an **A record** with the IP address to satisfy our query.  In addition, this response has the **AA=1** flag set, which indicates that it's an **authoritative** answer (aka "from the horse's mouth"). If an answer is provided but with AA=0, we assume it's from the server's cache.  The answer also includes the authority and glue information, but this time all we're really interested in is the answer itself. And the nameserver used the Query ID of **43562** to match this reply to the pending request. | DNS Packet, Step 7 |

As noted previously, these transactions typically occur **very** rapidly
across the internet, and the user is normally unaware that so much is going
on under the hood on his behalf.

But local performance is further enhanced by use of a local **cache**
in the recursive nameservers: this is an important part of the domain-name
system, and gets us one step closer to our security issue.

# What's in the cache?

![Dollar bill: yes, it's a visual pun](../images/dns-cash.gif)

In the DNS lookups we've seen so far, the ISP's resolving nameserver has
gone out and fully resolved each name from scratch, relying on no prior
knowledge except the built-in root hints.

But in practice this full road trip is not necessary: once we get an
authoritative answer for a given name, we can save it in a local cache
to use to satisfy future queries directly.

The more clients serviced by a nameserver, the more benefit of the cache:
the work of the full name resolutions is spread out over the whole client
base. It may well require quite a bit of memory in the nameserver, but the
amounts of RAM required are peanuts compared with the benefits.

![TTL logo - stopwatch](../images/dns-ttl-logo.gif)
## The Time-To-Live

When a DNS answer is stored in the local cache, it can't keep it forever:
this could lead to terribly stale data that effectively breaks the domains
involved.

![subset of packet showing A record TTL](../images/dns-packet-ttl-a.gif)

Fortunately, the recursive nameserver doesn't have the burden of guessing
how long to cache things: the **administrator of the zone** specifies
this information for every resource record. This is known as a **Time To Live**
(TTL), and it's a lifetime measured in seconds.

A TTL can be a short as a few minutes, or as long as a week
or more: this is entirely determined by the administrator of the zone.

In our final Step-7 answer above (with snippet to the right), we see the TTL of one hour
for the **A** record in **www.unixwiz.net**. All client requests for this
resource record in the next hour will be satisfied immediately, from the
cache. But once it expires, it's removed from cache and the next request
will force a full lookup from scratch.

![subset of packet showing NS/glue TTL](../images/dns-packet-ttl-ns.gif)

But it's not just the **A** record that's cached; all the other authority
data (the **NS** data plus associated glue **A** records) arrive with
their own TTLs, and are also cached. This means that a full lookup for
a single resource record could well fill the cache with a half
dozen associated records or more.

# Poisoning the cache

With a good understanding of a properly-functioning DNS, it's time to see
where things break. **Cache poisoning** is where the bad guy manages to
inject bogus data into a recursive nameserver's cache, causing it to give
out that bad information to unsuspecting local clients.

It's not so simple as just sending random DNS packets to a nameserver, as
DNS only accepts **responses to pending queries**; unexpected responses
are simply ignored.

 This is not "phishing"

Though DNS cache poisoning has similar end results to phishing
— getting a user to believe a bad site is genuine —
it's not the same thing.

With **phishing**, a bogus URL is used to reference the
malicious server, but it's disguised to look like the real hostname
(usually with a bit of clever HTML or CSS). An attentive user can
usually detect this misdirection by examining the URLs or hostnames
carefully.

With **DNS cache poisoning**, the very nature of DNS itself has
been subverted such that hostname-to-IP lookups can no longer be
trusted. The hostnames being visited are genuine, but they're
being routed to the bad server: this can't be detected by
inspection of links or HTML source code.

How does a nameserver know that any response packet is "expected"?

* The response arrives on the same UDP port we sent it from:
  otherwise the network stack would not deliver it to the waiting
  nameserver process (it's dropped instead).
* The **Question** section (which is duplicated in the reply)
  matches the Question in the pending query.
* The **Query ID** matches the pending query
* The Authority and Additional sections represent names that
  are within the same domain as the question: this is known
  as "bailiwick checking".

  This prevents **ns.unixwiz.net**
  from replying with not only the IP address of **www.unixwiz.net**,
  but also fraudulent information about (say) **BankOfSteve.com**.

If all of these conditions are satisfied, a nameserver will accept a packet
as a genuine response to a query, and use the results found inside. This
includes caching answers, as well as valid authority and additional data found
there too.

But if the bad guy can predict and forge a DNS response packet that's
*just right*, he can cause all kinds of shenanigans for the
victims.

The bad guy normally first chooses his **victim** by finding a nameserver
he believes vulnerable to poisoning: all of the clients of that DNS server get
to unwittingly ride the victim train as well.

Then he finds a **target domain**, one he wishes to take over. His intent
is to fool the victims into visiting his own malicious website instead of
the real deal: by getting **www.goodsite.com** to resolve to the **bad guy's
IP address**, the user's traffic visits the bad guy's website instead of
the good one.

We noted that unexpected packets were simply dropped, so a bad guy need not
get everything right every time: sending many packets attempting to guess some
of the key parameters is likely to prove fruitful with enough attempts.

## Guessing the Query ID

In old nameservers (and in our detailed packet trace example), the Query ID
simply increments by one on each outgoing request, and this makes it easy to
guess what the next one will be as long as an interloper can see a single
query.

![Bad guy finding Query ID](../images/badguy-intercept-dns.gif)

We probably can't directly ask the nameserver for its query ID, but we can
provoke it into telling us:

1. Bad guy asks the victim nameserver to look up a name in a zone for
   a nameserver he controls (perhaps **test.badguy.com**).

   He might query the server directly, if it permits recursion from
   his location, or he might convince a user to lookup a name —
   perhaps by including the test hostname on a web page.
2. Victim nameserver receives the request and makes the usual rounds
   to resolve the name starting at the root servers. Here, we've put
   the root and GTLD servers in the same category to separate them
   from the bad guy's nameserver.
3. Eventually, the victim nameserver will be directed to the bad guy's
   nameserver: after all, it's authoritative for **badguy.com**.
4. Bad guy monitors this lookup of **test.badguy.com** by
   sniffing the IP traffic going to his own machine, or perhaps
   even with a custom modification to the nameserver software,
   and from this discovers the source port and Query ID used.

   **Aha!**

At this point he knows the last query ID and source port used by
the victim nameserver.

But the thoughtful might wonder: so what? This hasn't poisoned anything
yet, and there's no need to engage in DNS shenanigans for **badguy.com**
anyway. After all, the bad guy is already authoritative for his own zone.

True enough, but this was only the first step: the *next* one
engages in DNS shenanigans for other domains.

# Shenanigans, Version 1

With the ability to easily predict a query ID, and since our
victim nameserver always sends queries from the same UDP port,
it should be easy enough to cause some trouble.

In this illustration, we'll attempt to poison a particular
nameserver with a fraudulent IP for a legitimate banking website,
**www.BankOfSteve.com**. The bad guy's intention is to get all of
the ISP's customers to visit his own malicious site instead of the real
one operated by the Bank.

![Simple Poisoning](../images/badguy-simple-poison-dns.gif)

* **Step 1** — Bad guy sends a DNS query to the victim nameserver
  for the hostname it wishes to hijack. This example assumes that the
  victim nameserver allows recursive queries from the outside world.
* **Step 2a** — Knowing that the victim will shortly be asking
  **ns1.bankofsteve.com** (as directed from the root/GTLD servers)
  for an IP address, the bad guy starts flooding the victim with forged
  DNS reply packets. All purport to be from ns1.bankofsteve.com, but include the
  answer with the IP of badguy's fraudulent webserver.
* **Steps 2b & 3** — Root/GTLD servers provide referral to
  **ns1.bankofsteve.com**. This may be multiple queries, but we're
  showing just one for simplicity.
* **Step 4** — victim nameserver asks **ns1.bankofsteve.com**
  for the IP address of **www.bankofsteve.com**, and it uses query ID
  1001 (one higher than the previous query).
* **Step 5** — the real nameserver provides a legitimate response
  to this query, with QID=1001. But if the bad guy has successfully matched
  the query ID in the step **2a** flood, this legal reply arrives too
  late and is ignored. Oops.
* **Step 6** — With the bogus IP address (of the bad guy's webserver)
  in cache it provides this poisoned answer to the requesting DNS client. **Boom**.
* **Step 7** (not illustrated) — future DNS clients asking
  for **www.bankofsteve.com** will receive the same fraudulent answer.

The rule is: *first good answer wins*. Most of the forged answers are
dropped because the Query ID doesn't match, but if *just one* in the flurry
of fake responses gets it right, the nameserver will accept the answer as
genuine.

And because that satisfies the request, the *real* answer that arrives
later is dropped, because the query is no longer pending.

In any case, once the bad guy gets the answer from the victim's nameserver,
the matter is closed, and he can stop flooding the victim.

We'll note that even though this illustrates trying to beat
just the reply from **ns1.bankofsteve.com**, our forged DNS traffic
could actually match the query ID of any of the prior steps.

This includes matching an earlier reply from the root server or the GTLD
(.com) server: if the query ID matches, our fake authoritative
wins, and pollutes the cache. This is a race, but only the attacker knows
it's playing.

 The name can't already be in the cache
 If **www.bankofsteve.com** is already in the victim nameserver's
cache, all of the external queries are avoided, and there's simply no
way to poison it in this manner.

If the bad guy still wants to poison that particular hostname, he has to
wait for it to expire from cache (as determined by the TTL).

 The bad guy has to guess the query ID
 This is made easy with (now-obsolete) nameservers that increment
the Query ID by one each time — even a busy nameserver has a fairly
small range to guess from.

 The bad guy has to be faster than the real nameserver
 If the victim nameserver and the real nameserver are topologically
close (network wise), then the steps 2/3 and 4/5 may complete so
quickly that the bad guy has a too-small window to exploit.

## Mitigations

 Is it random?

Older nameservers used a terrible random number algorithm
that allowed a bad guy to predict the next Query ID given
an existing one, and this was used by attackers to commit
cache poisoning.

Modern software uses real random number algorithms that don't
fall for this.

An obvious mitigation here is to **randomize the Query ID**.

With sequential Query IDs, the bad guy has a fairly limited
range of guesses required once he observes a single current Query ID.
If he sees QID=999, then he may flood with QIDs 1000-1029 in an
attempt to make at least one match.

Experience has shown this is an easy window to beat.

But if the nameserver chooses random Query IDs, then the attacker
has the full 16-bit pool to choose from — that's 64k values —
and this is a much harder target to hit in the narrow window of time
while the victim is going through the routine resolution steps.

Though forging 20 packets in routine name-resolution time is straightforward
enough, doing so with thousands of packets is a much more substantial
challenge.

So true randomization of Query IDs raises the bar quite a bit.

# Dan's Shenanigans

So far we've seen how to poison a single record, but this has less
impact than expected: it's just one record, and many properties require
multiple hostnames to operate, and it's harder to hack them all.

Dan Kaminsky found an approach that's dramatically more effective than
this, and it caused quite a furor in the security community. The general
approach is the same as the simple approach shown above, but the key
difference is the nature of the forged payload.

![Kaminsky Poisoning](../images/badguy-kaminsky-poison-dns.gif)

In the simple example, our intention was to poison the final answer,
the A record with the IP address, but what Dan discovered is that
we can go up one level and **hijack the authority records** instead.

Before undertaking the attack, the bad guy configures a nameserver
that's authoritative for the **bankofsteve.com** zone, including whatever
resource records he likes: A records, MX for email, etc.

There's nothing stopping anybody from configuring his own nameserver
to be authoritative for *any* domain, but it's pointless because
the root servers won't point to it: it's got answers, but nobody ever
asks it a question.

* **Step 1** — bad guy client requests a **random name**
  within the target domain (**www12345678.bankofsteve.com**), something
  unlikely to be in cache even if other lookups for this domain have been
  done recently.
* **Step 2a** — As before, the bad guy sends a stream of
  forged packets to the victim, but instead of **A** records as part of
  an Answer, it instead delegates to another nameserver via Authority
  records. "I don't know the answer, but you can ask over there".

  The authority data may well contain the "real" **bankofsteve.com**
  nameserver hostnames, but the glue **points those nameservers at badguy IPs**.
  This is the crucial poisoning, because a Query ID match means that the
  victim believes that badguy's nameservers are authoritative
  for **bankofsteve.com**.

  The bad guy now **owns the entire zone**.
* Curiously, the rest of the steps don't matter: the point of this
  process was to fake out the victim into thinking that badguy runs
  the domain in question, and that would have been successful in this
  step.

  Once one of the victim's queries has been poisoned — it could be
  any in the chain — all the rest are directed to badguy's servers.

This is a devastating attack: by owning the entire target
domain, the bad guy controls essentially everything with respect to
that resolving nameserver. He can redirect web visitors to his own
servers (imagine redirecting **google.com**), he can route email
to his own servers via serving up bogus MX records.

The bad guy will typically set a very high TTL in the poisoning
responses so that the victim will keep the bogus data in cache
as long as possible.

## Flurry of queries

Our example has shown a single query being hijacked, but this is
unlikely to be successful: because of Query ID randomization, it's
not likely that that the bad guy will manage to get a hit in the
short time required to match on 64k IDs.

Instead, the bad guy issues a flurry of queries, each for a different
random name under the main domain. The **first** request caused the
nameserver to perform the usual root-first resolution, but it eventually
caches the valid **ns1.bankofsteve.com** values. Subsequent queries within
this domain go directly to that nameserver, skipping the root steps.

But the next request for a different random name (which certainly
won't be in cache) causes an immediate query to the valid **ns1**
server. The bad guy then throws a flood of forged data at the
victim about that second random name, though the odds here are
still pretty long.

Just for the sake of discussion, let's assume that the bad guy can
generate 50 forged replies for each random name query before the
real reply arrives from the real nameserver. This appears to be
a very small chance, but when repeated over and over — and
run from automated tools — success by the bad guy is likely.

It's been reported that success can commonly be achieved in 10 seconds.

## Going for the top

Our examples have all focused on hijacking an end domain, but the same
techniques can do the same thing up a level: taking over **.COM**,
**.NET**, or the like.

By poisoning the Authority records for .COM and the like, the victim
nameserver will route all DNS lookups to the bad guy's nameservers.
This effectively hijacks all names under that top level, including
domains he didn't actually request. This gives a great deal of
flexibility even though it may well require substantial computing
and network resources to serve the flood of requests that this
hijacking must generate.

# What's the fix?

This all sounds awful: how does one fix this?

As has been alluded to several times, it's the small space — just
16 bits — of the Query ID that makes this attack possible. Though
certainly one might wish to increase that ID to something larger (perhaps
32 bits), it's simply not possible do that in the short term because
it would break DNS on the internet: the fields are what they are, and
they can't be changed casually.

DJB Was Right

One nameserver is notable for having gotten **both**
the query-id and source-port randomness right from the start:
[DJBDNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djbdns)
by the legendary Daniel J. Bernstein.

Though long a lightning rod for controversy, he's clearly
walked the walk on security: there's been just
[one
minor security vulnerability](http://marc.info/?l=djbdns&m=123613000920446&w=2) in DJBDNS.

But an additional source of randomness is required nevertheless, and
that's been done by **randomizing the source port**. Rather than use
just a single UDP port, which is trivial to discover, a much larger
range of ports is allocated by the nameserver and then used randomly
when making outbound queries.

As one would imagine, the nameserver would keep track of which source
port was used for each query: replies arriving on the wrong port would
be discarded just as if the Query ID failed to match.

Microsoft's updated DNS server is said to preallocate 2,500 UDP ports
to use for these random queries, and for discussion we'll round this down
to an even power of two:  **2 11 = 2,048**. This yields
this much larger transaction space:

![27 bits of entropy](../images/dns-trans-entropy.gif)

Increasing the search space from 64k to 134M provides far better
odds for the good guys.

We presume that each nameserver provides a way of setting how large of
a pool to use for these source ports, as well as a way of excluding
certain port numbers known to be required for other purposes.

# Summary

This has been an exceptionally serious vulnerability because it undermines
the very faith in DNS: this is at the core of the internet. Most experts
believe that if you can't trust DNS, all else is lost, and we're of this
same mind.

There is far more detail about this vulnerability than we can present
here, and we'll urge the reader to consult other resources (especially
[Dan's presentation](http://www.doxpara.com/DMK_BO2K8.ppt)).

But we can include a few (ahem) random notes about this matter that
didn't seem to fit in elsewhere, and seem important and/or interesting
enough to include in this paper.

* ***Patch your servers***: Tools exist to make
  exploit-in-a-box available to even low-skilled bad guys.
* Authoritative-only nameservers are not vulnerable because they
  have no cache to poison, but we'd be surprised if no small number
  of "auth only" nameservers actually provided recursive service
  to at least *some* clients.
* A nameserver need not be directly visible to the Internet to
  be exploitable. By convincing a user to visit a particular
  web page, it can trigger a chain of events that reliably
  lead to poisoning.
* Even patched servers may still be vulnerable if an intervening
  firewall performs [Port
  Address Translation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_address_translation) in a way that un-randomizes the source ports.
* It's been suggested that [DNSSEC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSSEC)
  or [IPv6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv6) are solutions to
  this problem, but this is only in theory. Both of these technologies
  have to be fully rolled out to be effective, and this is likely
  years away, at best.
* The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is only a partial protection against
  being redirected to malicious websites. Putting up a fake
  BankOfSteve.com website will have the wrong SSL certificate name
  (which is a warning to the user who's paying attention), but
  the great majority of users skip right through those warnings.
* But the bad guy can subvert even SSL: since many Certificate Authorities
  validate a user's control over a domain *by sending email*, hijacking
  a mailserver by attacking the cert vendor's resolving DNS, this may well
  mean that an attacker can obtain a fully-valid certificate for the target
  domain.

  This is very scary.

More details may be found at the following links:      http://www.isc.org/sw/bind/bind-security.php     http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1447   Here are the details from the Slackware 12.1 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/bind-9.4.2_P1-i486-1_slack12.1.tgz:   Upgraded to bind-9.4.2-P1.   This upgrade addresses a security flaw known as the CERT VU#800113 DNS Cache   Poisoning Issue.  This is the summary of the problem from the BIND site:     "A weakness in the DNS protocol may enable the poisoning of caching      recurive resolvers with spoofed data.  DNSSEC is the only full solution.      New versions of BIND provide increased resilience to the attack."   It is suggested that sites that run BIND upgrade to one of the new packages   in order to reduce their exposure to DNS cache poisoning attacks.   For more information, see:     http://www.isc.org/sw/bind/bind-security.php     http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1447   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com? Give slackware.osuosl.org a try.  This is another primary FTP site for Slackware that can be considerably faster than downloading directly from ftp.slackware.com.  Thanks to the friendly folks at the OSU Open Source Lab (http://osuosl.org) for donating additional FTP and rsync hosting to the Slackware project!  :-)  Also see the "Get Slack" section on http://slackware.com for additional mirror sites near you.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- powerdns spoofing problems
The PowerDNS packages were updated to offer better spoofing
resistance by not ignoring invalid queries. (CVE-2008-3337)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- dnsmasq spoofing problems
The DNS server dnsmasq was changed to use random UDP source ports
and a random TRXID now. (CVE-2008-1447)
This problem only affected openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- python multiple problems
The scripting language python was updated to fix several security
vulnerabilities. (CVE-2008-1679,CVE-2008-1887, CVE-2008-3143,
CVE-2008-3142, CVE-2008-3144, CVE-2008-2315, CVE-2008-2316)
All SUSE Linux products received updated python packages.
- mailman cross site scripting
The mailing list manager mailman was updated to fix a
cross-site-scripting bug (CVE-2008-0564) and a mistake in
translation.
All distributions containing mailman received updated packages.
- ruby multiple problems
The scripting language ruby was updated to fix:
- a possible information leakage (CVE-2008-1145)
- a directory traversal bug (CVE-2008-1891) in WEBrick
- various memory corruptions and integer overflows in array and
string handling (CVE-2008-2662, CVE-2008-2663, CVE-2008-2664,
CVE-2008-2725, CVE-2008-2726, CVE-2008-2727, CVE-2008-2728)
ruby was updated on all SUSE Linux products.
- Opera 9.52
Opera was upgraded to version 9.52 to fix possible security
vulnerabilities.
Please see <http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/952/> for
more details.
- neon NULL pointer problem
The helper library neon was updated to fix a NULL pointer dereference
in the digest authentication code. (CVE-2008-3746)
neon was updated on all affected distributions.
- rxvt-unicode session hijacking
Using rxvt-unicode it was possible to open a terminal on :0 when
the environment variable was not set.
This could be exploited by local users to hijack X11 connections (CVE-2008-1142).
rxvt-unicode was updated on openSUSE 10.2-11.0.
- perl multiple problems
Several problems were fixed in the scripting language perl.
Specially crafted regular expressions could crash perl
(CVE-2008-1927).
Insufficient symlink checks in the File::Path could result in wrong
file permissions (CVE-2008-2827).
Additionally problem in the CGI module was fixed that could result
in an endless loop if uploads were canceled.
- Wireshark / ethereal multiple security problems
Various vulnerabilities have been fixed in ethereal and wireshark:
CVE-2008-3137, CVE-2008-3138, CVE-2008-3139,
CVE-2008-3140, CVE-2008-3141, CVE-2008-3145
and CVE-2008-3146. Those could be potentially used to crash
wireshark or potentially execute code.
Updates have been released for all SUSE Linux distributions.
- namazu cross site scripting
The indexing engine namazu was upgraded to fix a UTF-7
cross-site-scripting vulnerability. (CVE-2008-1468)
namazu was updated on all products containing it.
- gnome-screensaver clipboard disclosure
gnome-screensaver was updated to disallows local users to
read the contents of the clipboard for a locked screen using
ctrl-v. (CVE-2007-6389)
Updates have been released for openSUSE 10.3, other distributions
were not affected.
- MySQL security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix a security problem:
CVE-2008-2079: MySQL allowed local users to bypass certain privilege
checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1)
DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within
the MySQL home data directory, which can point to tables that are
created in the future.
CVE-2006-7232: sql\_select.cc in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.32 and 5.1.x
before 5.1.14 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA
table, as originally demonstrated using ORDER BY.
MySQL was updated on all SUSE Linux distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Ruby upstream has announced another security flaw
(DoS vulnerability in REXML module):

<http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2008/08/23/dos-vulnerability-in-rexml/>

Test case available in part: "Impact".

Proposed preliminary fix:
<http://www.ruby-lang.org/security/20080823rexml/rexml-expansion-fix.rb>

Testing status: REXML parsing of provided *.xml file causes
                100% cpu usage for about 1 and 1/4 minutes
                (checked the ruby-1.8.5-5.5 case).

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The bind daemon is responsible for resolving hostnames in IP addresses and
vice versa.
The new version of bind uses a random transaction-ID (TRXID) and a random
UDP source-port for DNS queries to address DNS cache poisoning attacks
possible because of the "birthday paradox" and an attack discovered by Dan
Kaminsky. Unfortunately we do not have details about Kaminsky's attack and
have to trust the statement that a random UDP source-port is sufficient to
stop it.
DNS servers that do not support recursive queries or do not use a cache
(authoritative only servers) are not vulnerable too.
Update packages of bind9 for SLES8 will be available soon.
The glibc stub resolver is known to be vulnerable too and we will publish
updates as soon as possible.
Note, a local attacker can always sniff DNS queries and generate spoofed
responses easily.
If you use the UDP source-port number of the DNS server in your firewall
configuration, for example to let DNS queries through your packetfilter,
then you have to take steps to adapt your filter rules to the new behavior
of the DNS server.
2) Solution or Work-Around
To protect your infrastructure from cache poisoning attacks you should
provide two DNS servers.
One that is authoritative only and accessible from the Internet to resolve
queries for your local systems that are available over the Internet. The
other system (caching) is not accessible over the Internet and can be used
by internal clients to recursively lookup names and addresses.
But we encourage you to install the bind update as soon as possible too.
If you use the latest update of pdns-recursor you are not vulnerable to
this attack.
For the glibc stub resolver bug you can install a local secure DNS for-
warder on your machine or make a DNS forwarder available for a protected
network.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart the bind daemon after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0533)

## Topic

Updated bind packages that help mitigate DNS spoofing attacks are now
available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

[Updated 10th July 2008]
We have updated the Enterprise Linux 5 packages in this advisory. The
default and sample caching-nameserver configuration files have been updated
so that they do not specify a fixed query-source port. Administrators
wishing to take advantage of randomized UDP source ports should check their
configuration file to ensure they have not specified fixed query-source ports.

## Description

ISC BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the DNS
(Domain Name System) protocols.

The DNS protocol protects against spoofing attacks by requiring an attacker
to predict both the DNS transaction ID and UDP source port of a request. In
recent years, a number of papers have found problems with DNS
implementations which make it easier for an attacker to perform DNS
cache-poisoning attacks.

Previous versions of BIND did not use randomized UDP source ports. If an
attacker was able to predict the random DNS transaction ID, this could make
DNS cache-poisoning attacks easier. In order to provide more resilience,
BIND has been updated to use a range of random UDP source ports.
(CVE-2008-1447)

Note: This errata also updates SELinux policy on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
and 5 to allow BIND to use random UDP source ports.

Users of BIND are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to add this functionality.

Red Hat would like to thank Dan Kaminsky for reporting this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

## Vulnerabilities in DNS Could Allow Spoofing (953230)

Published: July 08, 2008 | Updated: December 09, 2009

**Version:** 3.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in the Windows Domain Name System (DNS) that could allow spoofing. These vulnerabilities exist in both the DNS client and DNS server and could allow a remote attacker to redirect network traffic intended for systems on the Internet to the attackerâs own systems.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by using strongly random DNS transaction IDs, using random sockets for UDP queries, and updating the logic used to manage the DNS cache. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 953230](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/953230) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products.

**What are the uninstall issues that customers may experience after installing these security updates?**

Supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows 2003 systems will receive the DNS server update as well as the DNS client updates. The DNS server update and the DNS client updates share binaries and must be uninstalled in the reverse order that they were installed to avoid regressing the shared binaries to previous versions. [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 823836](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/823836) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they uninstall these security updates.

**What are the random socket connection issues that customers may experience when installing this security update?**

By default, the DNS updates offered by this security bulletin will take advantage of a large number of available sockets to offer greater entropy. However, if the user has defined port ranges in the registry, then the updates will respect the user-defined settings and will only allocate the defined sockets.

Socket ranges can be defined in the following registry location:

**HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters Reg key Name: SocketPoolSize**

**Note** The DNS service must be restarted to implement these changes.

**What does defining the socket pool range do?**

It may be necessary to define the range of sockets that DNS can choose from to avoid conflicting with other applications or services that need the same socket pool for their communications. See [MaxUserPort](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/regentry/58791.mspx?mfr=true) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 812873](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/812873) for more details about these registry key settings.

**What are the differences between operating systems when defining the socket pool ranges?**

The MaxUserPort registry Key has different meanings on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 than on Microsoft Windows Server 2000 and Windows Server 2003. [Microsoft knowledge Base Article 929851](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929851) details the change in behavior for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.

In Microsoft Windows Server 2000 and Windows Server 2003, setting the MaxUserPort defines the ending point of the dynamic port range. The range starts at 1024 and continues to the user-defined value in the MaxUserPort registry key setting. After installing the updates offered by this security bulletin, the default behavior on Microsoft Windows Server 2000 and Windows Server 2003 will be to allocate sockets randomly from the port range 49152 to 65535. If the MaxUserPort range has been defined, then ports will be allocated randomly from 1024 to the defined value in the MaxUserPort registry key setting. Visit [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 812873](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/812873) for more information on reserving port ranges on Microsoft Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003.

In Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, setting the MaxUserPort defines the starting point of the dynamic port range. By default, the range on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 is 49152 to 65535.

**Where are the file information details?**

The file information details can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 953230](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/953230).

#### FAQ for DNS Insufficient Socket Entropy Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1447

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A spoofing vulnerability exists in Windows DNS client and DNS server. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could insert arbitrary addresses into the DNS cache.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Windows DNS service in the Windows DNS client and DNS server does not provide enough entropy when performing DNS queries.

**What is the Domain Name System (DNS)?**

Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the industry-standard suite of protocols that comprise TCP/IP. DNS is implemented using two software components: the DNS server and the DNS client (or resolver). Both components are run as background service applications. Network resources are identified by numeric IP addresses, but these IP addresses are difficult for network users to remember. The DNS database contains records that map user-friendly alphanumeric names for network resources, such as [www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com), to the IP addresses used by those resources for communication. In this way, DNS acts as a mnemonic device, making network resources easier to remember for network users. For more information and to view logical diagrams illustrating how DNS fits with other Windows technologies, review the article [what is DNS](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/ff937311-03ce-4d04-b72c-b39c4d51cb36).

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

| [Description](#c0)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-08 17:43:11 UTC  ``` BIND 9.5.1 Beta 1 is now available.      BIND 9.5.1b1 is a beta maintenance release of BIND 9.5.    URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT   URGENT                                                                URGENT    URGENT                Please read security alert below!               URGENT    URGENT                                                                URGENT    URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT URGENT      BIND 9.5.1b1 contains the following security fixes:  2375.	[security]	Fully randomize UDP query ports to improve 			forgery resilience. [RT #17949]  2384.	[security]	Additional support for query port randomization (change 			#2375) including performance improvement and port range 			specification.  [RT #17949, #18098]      Thanks to recent work by Dan Kaminsky of IOActive, ISC has become     aware of a potential attack exploiting weaknesses in the DNS protocol     itself to enable the poisoning of caching recurive resolvers with     spoofed data.      For additional information about this vulnerability, see US-CERT     (CERT VU#800113 DNS Cache Poisoning Issue).  For more details on the     changes to BIND, see <http://www.isc.org/sw/bind/forgery-resilience.php>.      IF YOU ARE RUNNING BIND AS A CACHING RESOLVER YOU NEED TO TAKE ACTION.      DNSSEC is the only definitive solution for this issue.  Understanding     that immediate DNSSEC deployment is not a realistic expectation, ISC     is releasing patched versions of BIND that improve its resilience     against this attack.  The method used makes it harder to spoof answers     to a resolver by expanding the range of UDP ports from which queries     are sent by the nameserver, thereby increasing the variability of     parameters in outgoing queries.  BIND 9.5.1b1 can be downloaded from          ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.5.1b1/bind-9.5.1b1.tar.gz  The PGP signature of the distribution is at          ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.5.1b1/bind-9.5.1b1.tar.gz.asc         ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.5.1b1/bind-9.5.1b1.tar.gz.sha256.asc         ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.5.1b1/bind-9.5.1b1.tar.gz.sha512.asc  The signature was generated with the ISC public key, which is available at <<http://www.isc.org/about/openpgp/pgpkey2006.txt>>.

## Multiple DNS implementations vulnerable to cache poisoning

#### Vulnerability Note VU#800113

Original Release Date: 2008-07-08 | Last Revised: 2014-04-14

---

### Overview

Deficiencies in the DNS protocol and common DNS implementations facilitate DNS cache poisoning attacks.

### Description

| The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating host names to IP addresses (and vice versa) and is critical for the normal operation of internet-connected systems. DNS cache poisoning (sometimes referred to as cache pollution) is an attack technique that allows an attacker to introduce forged DNS information into the cache of a caching nameserver. DNS cache poisoning is not a new concept; in fact, there are published articles that describe a number of inherent deficiencies in the DNS protocol and defects in common DNS implementations that facilitate DNS cache poisoning. The following are examples of these deficiencies and defects:     + **Insufficient transaction ID space**  The DNS protocol specification includes a transaction ID field of 16 bits. If the specification is correctly implemented and the transaction ID is randomly selected with a strong random number generator, an attacker will require, on average, 32,768 attempts to successfully predict the ID. Some flawed implementations may use a smaller number of bits for this transaction ID, meaning that fewer attempts will be needed. Furthermore, there are known errors with the randomness of transaction IDs that are generated by a number of implementations. Amit Klein researched several affected implementations in 2007. These vulnerabilities are described in the following vulnerability notes:      - [VU#484649](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/484649) - Microsoft Windows DNS Server vulnerable to cache poisoning - [VU#252735](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/252735) - ISC BIND generates cryptographically weak DNS query IDs - [VU#927905](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/927905) - BIND version 8 generates cryptographically weak DNS query identifiers    + **Multiple outstanding requests**  Some implementations of DNS services contain a vulnerability in which multiple identical queries for the same resource record (RR) will generate multiple outstanding queries for that RR. This condition leads to the feasibility of a "birthday attack," which significantly raises an attacker's chance of success. This problem was previously described in [VU#457875](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/457875). A number of vendors and implementations have already added mitigations to address this issue.    + **Fixed source port for generating queries**  Some current implementations allocate an arbitrary port at startup (sometimes selected at random) and reuse this source port for all outgoing queries. In some implementations, the source port for outgoing queries is fixed at the traditional assigned DNS server port number, 53/udp.Recent additional research into these issues and methods of combining them to conduct improved cache poisoning attacks have yielded extremely effective exploitation techniques. Caching DNS resolvers are primarily at risk--both those that are open (a DNS resolver is open if it provides recursive name resolution for clients outside of its administrative domain), and those that are not. These caching resolvers are the most common target for attackers; however, stub resolvers are also at risk. Because attacks against these vulnerabilities all rely on an attacker's ability to predictably spoof traffic, the implementation of per-query source port randomization in the server presents a practical mitigation against these attacks within the boundaries of the current protocol specification. Randomized source ports can be used to gain approximately 16 additional bits of randomness in the data that an attacker must guess. Although there are technically 65,535 ports, implementers cannot allocate all of them (port numbers <1024 may be reserved, other ports may already be allocated, etc.). However, randomizing the ports that are available adds a significant amount of attack resiliency. It is important to note that without changes to the DNS protocol, such as those that the [DNS Security Extensions](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033) (DNSSEC) introduce, these mitigations cannot completely prevent cache poisoning. However, if properly implemented, the mitigations reduce an attacker's chances of success by several orders of magnitude and make attacks impractical. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with the ability to conduct a successful cache poisoning attack can cause a nameserver's clients to contact the incorrect, and possibly malicious, hosts for particular services. Consequently, web traffic, email, and other important network data can be redirected to systems under the attacker's control. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**A number of vendors have released patches to implement source port randomization in the nameserver. This change significantly reduces the practicality of cache poisoning attacks. Please see the Systems Affected portion of this document for additional details for specific vendors. Additional information about Japanese vendors can be found in JPCERT/CC [JVNVU#800113](https://jvn.jp/cert/JVNVU800113/).Stub resolvers are also vulnerable to these attacks, so system administrators should patch stub resolvers that issue queries in response to attacker behavior and that may receive packets from an attacker. Administrators should watch for patches to client operating systems that implement port randomization in the stub resolver.**Note:** Routers, firewalls, proxies, and other gateway devices that perform Network Address Translation (NAT)--more specifically Port Address Translation (PAT)--often rewrite source ports in order to track connection state. When modifying source ports, PAT devices can reduce source port randomness implemented by nameservers and stub resolvers (conversely, a PAT device can also increase randomness). A PAT device can reduce or eliminate improvements gained by patching DNS software to implement source port randomization. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**  Administrators, particularly those who are unable to apply a patch, can limit exposure to this vulnerability by restricting sources that can ask for recursion. Note that restricting access will still allow attackers with access to authorized hosts to exploit this vulnerability. The document "[Securing an Internet Name Server](http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/dns.pdf)" contains instructions for restricting recursion in ISC BIND.**Filter traffic at network perimeters**Because the ability to spoof IP addresses is necessary to conduct these attacks, administrators should filter spoofed addresses at the network perimeter. IETF Request for Comments (RFC) documents [RFC 2827](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2827), [RFC 3704](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3704), and [RFC 3013](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3013) describe best current practices (BCPs) for implementing this defense. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. **Run a local DNS cache**In lieu of strong port randomization characteristics in a stub resolver, administrators can protect their systems by using local caching full-service resolvers both on the client systems and on servers that are topologically close (on the network) to the client systems. These resolvers should be used in conjunction with the network segmentation and filtering strategies mentioned above.**Disable recursion**Disable recursion on any nameserver responding to DNS requests made by untrusted systems. "[Securing an Internet Name Server](http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/dns.pdf)" contains instructions for disabling recursion in various versions of ISC's BIND.The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [Special Publication 800-81 "Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide"](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-81/SP800-81.pdf) contains detailed and thorough information about the secure deployment of DNS servers, including the recommendations above. Administrators are strongly encouraged to review this document and consider implementing the recommendations it describes.**Implement source port randomization**Vendors that implement DNS software are encouraged to review IETF Internet Draft "[Measures for making DNS more resilient against forged answers](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsext-forgery-resilience)" for additional information about implementing mitigations in their products. This document is a work in progress and may change prior to its publication as an RFC, if it is approved. System implementers may also wish to review IETF Internet Draft "[Port Randomization](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-port-randomization)" for a more generalized approach to how port randomization can mitigate some other types of spoofing attacks.As noted [above](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113#pat), routers, firewalls, and other gateway devices that perform NAT/PAT may modify source ports in ways that reduce the effectiveness of source port randomization. |

Bulletin ID: 2008-07-28-001-ipa
Revision: 1.0

Title:
Multiple DNS implementations vulnerable to cache poisoning
(US-CERT Vulnerability Note VU#800113)

Summary:
Multiple FEC products may be subjected to the vulnerability described in US-CERT Note VU#800113. This vulnerability describes the principal possibility of DNS cache poisoning. An attacker with the ability to conduct a successful cache poisoning attack can cause a nameserver’s clients to contact the incorrect, and possibly malicious, hosts for particular services. Consequently, web traffic, email, and other important network data can be redirected to systems under the attacker's control.

Products affected:
All FEC products running the BOSS operating system are affected.

Details (full details at: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113>):
The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating host names to IP addresses (and vice versa) and is critical for the normal operation of internet-connected systems. DNS cache poisoning (sometimes referred to as cache pollution) is an attack technique that allows an attacker to introduce forged DNS information into the cache of a caching nameserver. DNS cache poisoning is not a new concept; in fact, there are published articles that describe a number of inherent deficiencies in the DNS protocol and defects in common DNS implementations that facilitate DNS cache poisoning. The following are examples of these deficiencies and defects:
a) Insufficient transaction ID space
The DNS protocol specification includes a transaction ID field of 16 bits. If the specification is correctly implemented and the transaction ID is randomly selected with a strong random number generator, an attacker will require, on average, 32,768 attempts to successfully predict the ID. Some flawed implementations may use a smaller number of bits for this transaction ID, meaning that fewer attempts will be needed.
b) Multiple outstanding requests
Some implementations of DNS services contain a vulnerability in which multiple identical queries for the same resource record (RR) will generate multiple outstanding queries for that RR. This condition leads to the feasibility of a 'birthday attack,' which significantly raises an attacker's chance of success. This problem was previously described in VU#457875. A number of vendors and implementations have already added mitigations to address this issue.
c) Fixed source port for generating queries
Some current implementations allocate an arbitrary port at startup (sometimes selected at random) and reuse this source port for all outgoing queries. In some implementations, the source port for outgoing queries is fixed at the traditional assigned DNS server port number, 53/udp.

Software Patches and Recommendation:
Susceptibility to the vulnerabilities has been removed and patches are available in the download area of our web site at <http://www.funkwerk-ec.com>. For security reasons it is recommended to update all affected FEC products with the appropriate software patch (see the following list for more details):

VPN Access Series: 7.4.1 PATCH 11
X8500            : 7.4.1 PATCH 11
R200 Series      : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
R1200            : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
R3x00 Series     : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
R4x00 Series     : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
TR200            : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
Wx002 Series     : 7.6.1 PATCH 2
WI Series        : 7.6.1 PATCH 2

To determine the software version running on a FEC router, log in to the device and issue the command "show rev". For products offering the Funkwerk Configuration Interface, point your browser at the IP address of your FEC product. You can find the version information on the status page. This will display the current software version running on the  system (see row denoted with Boss). A description how to update a FEC router can be found within the product documentation (see chapter Gateway Management). If you want to update  your software, make sure you read the relevant Release Notes. They describe all changes  introduced with the new system software.

### [Internet Systems Consortium](#MIMG-7E6K7P) Affected

Notified:  April 29, 2008  Updated: July 14, 2008

**Statement Date:   July 03, 2008**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

ISC is providing patches for BIND 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5 (tagged -P1) that
implement measures to enhance resilience against this sort of attack.
BIND accomplishes this by including the use of the source port queries
as additional information that would need to be predicted by a
successful attack.

ISC is also making beta releases, BIND 9.5.1b1 and 9.4.3b2 available
for download and testing.  These beta releases provide the same
improved resiliency as the patches but with better performance for
servers with query volumes at or above 10,000 queries per second.
They are however betas, not fully tested production releases. The
patches,(P1 versions), are fully tested today and released for
production use.  Older versions of BIND 9 and BIND 8 will not be
patched as they are EOL.

ISC notes that even with these measures, the nature of the DNS
protocol is such that attacks of this nature may still succeed. The
only solution to fully counter this sort of attack is to deploy DNSSEC
in DNS zones and enable DNSSEC validation in the resolvers.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#MIMG-7ECLB3) Affected

Notified:  May 05, 2008  Updated: July 17, 2008

**Statement Date:   July 17, 2008**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Openwall GNU/\*/Linux (Owl) 2.0-stable and current used versions of BIND
that did not randomize query source port numbers.  This has been
corrected by updating to BIND 9.3.5-P1 in Owl-current on July 8th and in
Owl 2.0-stable on July 11th, 2008.  Query IDs were already being
randomized by versions of BIND in supported branches of Owl.

Additionally, the DNS resolver in our revision of the GNU C Library
(glibc) had been modified to randomize query IDs in year 2000, before
Owl was first made available to the general public.  However, it was
not, and it still has not been, modified to randomize source ports as
well.  With these issues getting more attention lately, this is being
considered as a higher priority task now.

Also relevant is the fact that running our "userland" with a recent
Linux kernel (2.6.24 or newer) introduces randomization of source port
numbers for UDP-based queries, although added security of this setup has
not been fully evaluated (specifically, whether new port numbers are
allocated for every query in all cases and whether the produced sequence
of random port numbers is sufficiently cryptographically secure).

random UDP source-ports which should make it not vulnerable to the
new attack Dan Kaminsky found.

The DNS forwarder dnsmasq does not emit recursive queries and
is therefore not vulnerable as far as we know. Additionally
dnsmasq will be fixed to use a CPRNG for generating the TRXID
and the UDP source-port.

### [MaraDNS](#CRDY-7GENET) Not Affected

Updated:  July 10, 2008

**Statement Date:   June 27, 2008**

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

MaraDNS uses a secure random number generator to generate both the query
ID and the port to bind to.  In more detail, MaraDNS uses information from
the file /dev/urandom as a random seed to generate a cryptographic key.
Using a variant of AES, MaraDNS has 16 bits of entropy for the query ID
and 12 bits of entropy for the source port.

Deadwood, a from-the-ground-up reimplementation of MaraDNS also uses a secure
random number generator.  Instead of using an AES variant, Deadwood uses a
stream cipher called "Radio Gatun" (a derivative of Panama) as the random
number generator.

Note that the Windows port, if improperly configured, will have possible
security issues because there is not a convenient pool of random numbers
on that platform.

So, in summary, I am aware of this security problem and have gone to some
effort make sure MaraDNS (and Deadwood) does not have this issue.

### [NLnet Labs](#MIMG-7EMJVA) Not Affected

Notified:  May 14, 2008  Updated: July 10, 2008

**Statement Date:   May 16, 2008**

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

Unbound implements numerous strategies to prevent spoof protection,

those include udp port randomization,  rtt banding, source ip
randomization, and optionally, so called 0x20 query name randomization.
Besides, Unbound features an architectural element that performs sanity
checks on incoming data to prevent certain types of poisoning attempts.

Although Unbound has been built using all known protections against DNS
spoofs, the DNS protocol is inherently vulnerable to these sorts of
attacks. NLnet Labs believes that the only real solution to this problem
is the use of DNSSEC.

### Vendor Information

We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

The vendor has also posted an additional statement about this issue at the following location:

**Statement Date:   June 06, 2008**

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

PowerDNS Vendor Statement
-------------------------
Since version 3.0, released in April 2006, the PowerDNS Recursor resolving
nameserver has implemented measures that protect against the vulnerability
described in CVE-2008-1447. Source ports are randomized, and 'near misses',
indicating a spoofing attempt in progress, are detected, and the query is
dropped.

Although all 3.x versions implement these measures, from 3.1.6 a
cryptographically secure random generator is used which further enhances
protection against spoofing, so an upgrade to 3.1.6 or higher is advised.
