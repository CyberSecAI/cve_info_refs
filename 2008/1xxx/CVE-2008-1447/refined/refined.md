Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1447:

**1. Content Verification:**

*   The provided documents discuss DNS cache poisoning attacks and relate them to the CVE-2008-1447.  The content from kb.cert.org, debian.org, ruby-lang.org, and various vupen.com pages directly address the vulnerability and its impact on DNS implementations, as well as referencing back to CERT VU#800113.  This aligns with the description in the given CVE
    The content from the various microfocus.com, ruby-lang.org, and vupen.com pages all reference the same CVE. The content from the security-tracker.debian.org and security.gentoo.org provide patches for various products to address this CVE, while also referencing the CVE ID.
*   The content from www.microsoft.com, support.apple.com, and several vupen.com pages also address CVE-2008-1447
*   The content from launchpad.net details specific patches for the bind9 package for the same CVE, while also referencing it by name.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   The core issue is a lack of sufficient randomness in the DNS protocol when making queries, as it uses a 16-bit transaction ID and some implementations do not randomize the UDP source port.
*   This predictable nature allows an attacker to forge responses and poison the DNS cache of a vulnerable DNS resolver.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Insufficient Transaction ID Space:** The 16-bit transaction ID field, if not generated with sufficient randomness, makes it easier for attackers to predict and forge responses.
*   **Multiple Outstanding Requests:** Some DNS servers will create multiple outgoing queries for the same resource record, which makes "birthday attacks" more feasible because there are now more targets for the attacker to guess the TXID.
*   **Fixed Source Port for Generating Queries:** Some servers use a fixed port (or one randomly allocated at start up and then reused for all outgoing queries) as the source port when initiating DNS requests. This predictability of the source port further aids attackers in successful spoofing attempts.
*  **Lack of Taintness Check in dl (Ruby):** In the context of Ruby, the `dl` module does not check taint, which could allow attackers to call dangerous functions.
*  **DNS Spoofing vulnerability in resolv.rb (Ruby):** resolv.rb allows attackers to spoof DNS answers. This was mitigated by adding randomness to DNS transaction IDs and source ports.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Cache Poisoning:** Attackers can inject forged DNS information into the cache of a caching nameserver (both recursive and stub resolvers).
*   **Redirection of Traffic:** Successful cache poisoning allows attackers to redirect clients of the poisoned nameserver to incorrect (and potentially malicious) hosts.
*   **Data Redirection:** Web traffic, email, and other network data can be redirected to systems under the attacker's control.
* **Remote Code Execution and Denial of Service (Ruby):** The WEBrick and dl module vulnerabilities in Ruby can be used for DoS or to allow attackers to call dangerous functions, respectively.

**5. Attack Vectors**

*   **Remote Attacks:** This is primarily a remote attack, where an attacker sends spoofed UDP packets to a vulnerable DNS resolver from outside of the administrative domain, although local users may also be able to leverage the flaw if they have access to internal network traffic.
*   **Spoofed Traffic:** The attack relies on the attacker's ability to predictably spoof (forge) IP packets.
*  **Malicious Websites (Ruby):** In the context of Ruby's WebRick DoS vulnerability, a malicous website that uses a backtracking regular expression can cause a denial-of-service on vulnerable systems.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the target DNS server.
*   **IP Address Spoofing:** The attacker must be able to spoof the source IP address of a legitimate DNS server, so they need the capability to send forged packets from the perspective of the target resolver.
*   **Predictability/Enumeration of Query IDs and Source Ports:** The attacker has to know or predictably guess the transaction ID or source port used by the vulnerable DNS server.
*   **High Rate Packet Injection:** The attacker may require the ability to send packets at a high rate in order to increase the chances of successful cache poisoning by exploiting multiple queries from the vulnerable server (birthday attack).
*   **Malicious Code Execution (Ruby):** For the Ruby-related vulnerabilities, attackers can execute malicious code on vulnerable systems. For the REXML flaw, a specially crafted XML document would be required. For the dl vulnerability, the attacker needs to call dangerous functions in the system.

**7. Additional Notes**

*   **Mitigations:** The documents stress the importance of source port randomization in DNS implementations and the use of DNSSEC as better solutions to address the root cause of the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Products:** The content identifies several affected vendors and software, including BIND, Microsoft Windows DNS Server, dnsmasq, ruby and various operating systems like Linux distros and Apple products, along with many vendors including:
  Alcatel-Lucent, Apple Computer, Inc., Avaya, Inc., Blue Coat Systems, BlueCat Networks, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Debian GNU/Linux, F5 Networks, Inc., Force10 Networks, Inc., FreeBSD, Inc., Fujitsu, Funkwerk Enterprise Communications, Gentoo Linux, Hewlett-Packard Company, IBM Corporation, Infoblox, Internet Systems Consortium, Juniper Networks, Inc., Mandriva, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, NEC Corporation, Nixu, Nominum, Nortel Networks, Inc., Novell, Inc., OpenBSD, Openwall GNU/\*/Linux, QNX, Software Systems, Inc., Red Hat, Inc., SUSE Linux, Secure Computing Network Security Division, Slackware Linux Inc., Sun Microsystems, Inc., Ubuntu, Wind River Systems, Inc., Yamaha Corporation, dnsmasq, Check Point Software Technologies, Foundry Networks, Inc., Hitachi, JH Software, MaraDNS, NLnet Labs, OpenDNS, PePLink, PowerDNS, djbdns
*   **Vendor Statements:** The documents include vendor responses to the vulnerability, ranging from acknowledgement of the issue to specific patch information.
*   **NAT/PAT:** The vulnerability can be exacerbated by the use of Network Address Translation devices, specifically devices which alter the source port in Network Address Translations (PAT)

In summary, CVE-2008-1447 arises from weak implementation of randomness in DNS communications, allowing attackers to inject forged records, leading to traffic redirection and potentially code execution/DoS.  The content reflects that it was a serious issue with far-reaching implications, requiring widespread patching and implementation of better defenses to mitigate the problem.
