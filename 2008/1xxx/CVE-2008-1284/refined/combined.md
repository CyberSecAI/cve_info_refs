| [Description](#c0)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-07 23:44:47 UTC  ``` Some vulnerabilities have been reported in various Horde products, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions.  1) The Horde API does not properly restrict access to users with the correct credentials. No further information is currently available.  This vulnerability is reported in Horde 3.1.5, Mnemo 2.1.1, Nag 2.1.3, Kronolith 2.1.6, Turba 2.1.5, Horde Groupware Webmail Edition 1.0.3, and Horde Groupware 1.0.2. Prior versions may also be affected.  2) The share change functionality does not properly restrict access to users with the correct credentials. No further information is currently available.  This vulnerability is reported in Mnemo 2.1.1, Nag 2.1.3, Kronolith 2.1.6, Horde Groupware Webmail Edition 1.0.3, and Horde Groupware 1.0.2. Prior versions may also be affected.  Solution: Update to Horde 3.1.6, Mnemo 2.1.2, Nag 2.1.4, Kronolith 2.1.7, Turba 2.1.6, Horde Groupware Webmail Edition 1.0.4, and Horde Groupware 1.0.3. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-07 23:47:45 UTC  ``` maintainers: Turba is ok, but at least horde-kronolith needs a fixed stable version. ok for calling arches to stable 2.1.7?. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2008-03-09 10:34:21 UTC  ``` it's fine ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-09 20:54:33 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable www-apps/horde-kronolith-2.1.7.

Horde 3.1.6 arbitrary file inclusion vulnerability, proof of concept & patch.
A severe security vulnerability affects any unix distribution running version 3.1.6 of the Horde webmail client included in most popular webhosting control panels. All previous versions are also affected and it is believed although not yet proven that Horde Groupware is also vulnerable.
Details are as follows:
David Collins and Patrick Pelanne along with the rest of the HostGator.com LLC support team discovered that Horde was not properly sanitizing POST variables for several options including it's themes. By maliciously modifying POST data sent to the client the attacker can modify the location of the theme variable and Horde will subsequently insert this information into it's database. By modifying this POST variable one can allow for directory traversal and file inclusion which can lead to full root privilege escalation.
Proof of concept:
Data injected through malicious tampering of POST data:
mysql> select \* from horde\_prefs where pref\_uid='bbarker (at) hostgator (dot) com [email concealed]' and pref\_name='theme';
+-------------------------+------------+-----------+--------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------+
| pref\_uid | pref\_scope | pref\_name | pref\_value |
+-------------------------+------------+-----------+--------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------+
| bbarker (at) hostgator (dot) com [email concealed] | horde | theme | ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/.horde/imp/att
achments/bbarker (at) hostgator (dot) com [email concealed]/1204804402/t.txt |
Shown above, the malicious POST variable was inserted into the database and now points to the malicious code denoted by t.txt
A truncated strace shows the access and execution of the malicious code when the user enters the Horde webmail client:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Horde Application Framework: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200805-01**

### Background

The Horde Application Framework is a general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP, providing classes for handling preferences,
compression, browser detection, connection tracking, MIME and more.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in the Horde Application
Framework:

* David Collins, Patrick Pelanne and the
  HostGator.com LLC support team discovered that the theme preference
  page does not sanitize POST variables for several options, allowing the
  insertion of NULL bytes and ".." sequences (CVE-2008-1284).
* An
  error exists in the Horde API allowing users to bypass security
  restrictions.

### Impact

The first vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker to read
arbitrary files and by remote authenticated attackers to execute
arbitrary files. The second vulnerability can be exploited by
authenticated remote attackers to perform restricted operations.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Horde Application Framework users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/horde-3.1.7"
```

All horde-groupware users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/horde-groupware-1.0.5"
```

All horde-kronolith users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/horde-kronolith-2.1.7"
```

All horde-mnemo users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/horde-mnemo-2.1.2"
```

All horde-nag users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/horde-nag-2.1.4"
```

All horde-webmail users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/horde-webmail-1.0.6"
```
