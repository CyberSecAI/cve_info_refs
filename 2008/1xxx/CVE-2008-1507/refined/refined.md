Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1507 (Although multiple CVEs are mentioned, the exploit targets vulnerabilities associated with PEEL CMS, which aligns with CVE-2008-1507)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The exploit leverages multiple vulnerabilities within PEEL CMS, including:
    *   **Default Credentials:** The exploit attempts to log in using default credentials such as "info@peel.fr:admin" and "contact@peel.fr:cinema."
    *   **SQL Injection:** The exploit utilizes SQL injection vulnerabilities in `achat/historique_commandes.php` and `factures/facture_html.php` to extract admin email addresses and password hashes. Both UNION based and blind SQL injection techniques are used.
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The exploit takes advantage of an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the product management section of the admin interface, specifically within the image upload functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   *   **Weak Credentials**: Using default or easily guessable credentials.
   *   **SQL Injection**:  Unsanitized user inputs allow for SQL injection attacks, enabling data exfiltration and potential authentication bypass.
   *   **Unrestricted File Upload**:  Lack of proper validation and sanitization of uploaded files allows arbitrary file uploads.
   *  **Insecure handling of image upload:** The application does not properly validate file types or content during image uploads allowing an attacker to upload malicious code as an image file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Admin Account Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain administrative access to the CMS.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a PHP file, the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a full system compromise.
    *   **Data Breach**: The SQL injection attacks can be used to extract sensitive information, including user credentials.
   *   **Website Defacement**: The attacker can manipulate the content and structure of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Requests:** The exploit uses crafted HTTP GET and POST requests to target the vulnerable endpoints, including product management and login pages.
    *   **SQL Injection:** By injecting malicious SQL code into vulnerable parameters in URLs, the attacker can extract sensitive data from the database.
    *   **File Upload:** The attacker leverages the file upload feature in product management to upload malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target server to send HTTP requests.
    *   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to know the target CMS is PEEL CMS and the path to vulnerable endpoints.
    *   **HTTP Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests.
    *  **Ability to execute scripts:** The attacker needs to execute PHP script which implements the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
The provided exploit script details a multi-pronged approach:
1.  **Credential Guessing:** It attempts to log in using common default usernames and passwords.
2.  **SQL Injection:** It attempts to retrieve admin credentials through SQL injection. It also includes a basic MD5 cracking functionality by using external online services.
3. **Arbitrary File Upload:** The script uploads a malicious php file (a web shell) as an image, thus gaining arbitrary code execution.
4. **File cleanup:** The script deletes the fake product, while leaving the malicious file.
5.  **PHP Class:** The exploit also includes a custom PHP class for handling HTTP requests, simulating a browser.

The exploit code targets multiple versions of PEEL CMS, including "PEEL PREMIUM", "PEEL POWERSELL", "PEEL INTEGRALE", and "PEEL PROFESSIONNELLE".
