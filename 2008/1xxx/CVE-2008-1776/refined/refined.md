{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes a file using a user-controlled parameter `PATH_TO_CODE` without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the vulnerable application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `modules/basicfog/basicfogfactory.class.php` with the `PATH_TO_CODE` parameter pointing to a malicious URL.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application and have a web server to host the malicious code."
