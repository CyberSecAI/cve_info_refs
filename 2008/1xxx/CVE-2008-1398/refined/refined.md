{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses the value of the 'X-Forwarded-For' HTTP header directly in an SQL query without sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive information such as usernames and passwords by injecting SQL commands into the 'X-Forwarded-For' header.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable application, including a malicious SQL payload within the X-Forwarded-For header.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable AuraCMS server and manipulate the X-Forwarded-For header. No prior authentication is needed."
