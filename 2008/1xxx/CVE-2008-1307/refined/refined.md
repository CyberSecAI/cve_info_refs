{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `SetUninstallName` function in `UpdateOcx2.dll` does not properly validate the length of user-provided input when copying it to a heap buffer using `wcscpy`. This leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow due to lack of input validation in `wcscpy` function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS) due to the heap overflow.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the `SetUninstallName` method of the `UpdateOcx2.dll` ActiveX control using a specially crafted string. The attacker can use a web browser with a malicious webpage or application to call `SetUninstallName`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to load a webpage or application that can instantiate the vulnerable ActiveX control and call its `SetUninstallName` method with an overly long string."
