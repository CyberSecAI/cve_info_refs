      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-1851",

      "weaknesses": [
        {
          "type": "Directory Traversal",

          "type": "Denial of Service (DoS)",
          "description": "The ovalarmsrv service can be frozen by sending incomplete multi-line requests, causing 100% CPU usage and preventing further request handling. The service uses a loop that terminates when all sub-arguments are received. Not sending all arguments will freeze the service."

          "type": "NULL Pointer Dereference",
          "description": "Specifying an excessively large and unallocable amount of sub-arguments to the ovalarmsrv service leads to a NULL pointer dereference, causing the service to crash."

          "type": "Process Termination",
           "description": "The ovtopmd service allows for remote process termination via a specific packet, leading to a Denial of Service."

      "impact": "An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution via directory traversal, denial of service (DoS) by freezing the ovalarmsrv service or terminating the ovtopmd service, or crash the ovalarmsrv service by causing a null pointer dereference.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending specially crafted HTTP requests with forward slashes to traverse directories.",
         "Sending incomplete multi-line requests to the ovalarmsrv service.",
