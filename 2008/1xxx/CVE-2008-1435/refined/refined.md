{
  "CVE-2008-1435": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists when saving a specially crafted search file within Windows Explorer. This operation causes Windows Explorer to exit and restart in an exploitable manner.",
    "Root cause": "Windows Explorer does not correctly parse search files when saving them.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper parsing of saved search files in Windows Explorer."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain the same user rights as the local user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Email: An attacker could send a specially crafted saved-search file to a user and convince them to open and save it.",
      "Web-based attack: An attacker could host a website containing a malformed saved search file or inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites accepting user-generated content."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted saved-search (.search-ms) file and convince the user to open and save the file.",
    "Required attacker position": "The attacker does not need to be on the local network. They can exploit the vulnerability remotely."
  }
