Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1082:

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Opera represents DOM attribute values of imported XML documents. Specifically, the browser fails to properly sanitize these values before using them, which can be exploited by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows for XSS attacks because unsanitized DOM attribute values can be used to inject malicious scripts into a web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary script execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable website, potentially leading to:
  - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
  - Defacing web pages.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious XML documents with specially crafted DOM attributes. When these documents are imported into a web page via Opera, the browser fails to properly sanitize these attributes, which results in the execution of injected scripts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver or have a user import a malicious XML document through a vulnerable Opera browser.
- The attacker needs to craft the malicious XML document with special DOM attributes containing malicious scripts.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is resolved in Opera version 9.26.
- This vulnerability is related to how Opera handles imported XML documents and their DOM attributes.
- The vulnerability is classified as a "normal" severity and is remotely exploitable.
