Timbuktu Pro Remote Path Traversal and Log Injection
\*Advisory Information\*
Title: Timbuktu Pro Remote Path Traversal and Log Injection
Advisory ID: CORE-2008-0204
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/?action=item&id=2166
Date published: 2008-03-11
Date of last update: 2008-03-11
Vendors contacted: Motorola
Release mode: Forced release
\*Vulnerability Information\*
Class: Remote Path Traversal
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: 28081
CVE Name: CVE-2008-1117, CVE-2008-1118
\*Vulnerability Description\*
Timbuktu Pro [1] is a desktop-to-desktop remote control software for the
Windows and Macintosh operating systems. The following vulnerabilities
have been identified in Timbuktu Pro:
1) File transfer directory traversal (CVE-2008-1117): The '\' and '/'
are not properly sanitized when checking the destination filename. The
problem resides in the Notes feature implemented by tb2ftp.dll loaded by
the tb2pro.exe. This is the main issue.
2) Log input manipulation (CVE-2008-1118): Several fields of the packet
containing peer information (computer name, user name and IP address)
are taken from the packet sent to the target and used to display this
information on the screen of the target.
The vulnerabilities discovered allow a remote attacker to upload a file
to an arbitrary location on the victim's machine and forge peer
information on the log lines of the victim's application. For example,
an attacker could write an executable in a startup directory of the
victim's machine and wait for the user to restart his/her machine.
Another example is to write a fake system DLL in an existing program
directory, inducing Windows to load this module instead of the real DLL
from 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\'
\*Vulnerable Packages\*
. Timbuktu Pro 8.6.5 for Windows.
. Timbuktu Pro 8.7 for Mac OS X may also be vulnerable.
\*Non-vulnerable Packages\*
\*Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds\*
Contact the vendor for fix information.
\*Credits\*
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Sebastian Mu?iz from
CORE IMPACT's Exploit Writing Team (EWT), Core Security Technologies.
\*Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code\*
The most important bug is the directory traversal (1) bug for the Flash
Notes feature of the Timbuktu Pro client.
Timbuktu Pro is able to send Flash Notes (like an instant message) and
attach files to those notes. Both the message (which will be written to
a text file once received by the target) and the files attached to the
note are transferred to a temporal folder on the target installation
folder (default path is C:\Program Files\Timbuktu Pro\). The file
transfer begins and it is unnoticed by the target user. Once the
transfer is complete, the target user is shown a dialogue on the screen
that displays the message with the names of the files attached.
The user reads the message and he/she can decide whether or not to keep
the uploaded files. If the user closes the message dialogue, the files
are deleted from the temp folder; otherwise they are kept. The bug
allows the attacker to upload a file to ANY location relative to the
Timbuktu Pro installation folder with an attacker-selected filename for
the target.
Another very important thing is that when the files are stored outside
the temporal folder, they are not deleted even if the user refuses to
save the file.
Additionally, the attacker can avoid displaying the dialogue that
notifies the user about the message and the attached files making the
attack invisible for the target.
The other bug is a logging file content manipulation vulnerability
allowing the attacker to use the data inside protocol's packet to
disrupt the log file with control characters like '\n' and others. This
bug is not very important alone, but could be combined with the
traversal bug to cover tracks about the file upload inserting false log
lines or control characters.
In the following code the the program obtains the filename from the
packet searching from right to left for the filename without the path
following the last '\'. Then if a '\' character is found then it doesn't
search for the character '/', making it possible to traverse the
directories, sending a filename like '\../../../evil.exe'. In this
example, the resulting filename extracted is '../../../evil.exe'.
A dangerous possibility is writing an executable in a startup directory
of the victim's machine and wait for the user to restart his/her
machine. Another one is writing a fake system DLL in an existing program
directory, inducing Windows to load this module instead of the real DLL
from 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\'
Disassembled vulnerable code follows, read the comments if you want to
fully understand the bug:
/-----------
.text:6063A62E mov edx, [ebp+lp]
.text:6063A631 mov eax, [edx+20h] ; Packet field containing filename
.text:6063A634 push eax ; EAX is also the output buffer
.text:6063A635 call ds:Pascal2C ; Extract filename from packet
.text:6063A63B push '\' ; Char to filter in the filename
.text:6063A63D mov ecx, [ebp+lp]
.text:6063A640 mov edx, [ecx+20h]
.text:6063A643 push edx ; Filename obtained in 0x6063A635
.text:6063A644 call \_strrchr ; Search for '\' in the filename
.text:6063A649 add esp, 8 ; At this point, the pointer to the
; position of the '\' is obtained and
; will be stored in a local variable.
.text:6063A64C mov [ebp+pSlashPosition], eax ; Store '\' pointer
.text:6063A64F cmp [ebp+pSlashPosition], 0 ; This is the BUG !!!!
.text:6063A653 jnz short loc\_6063A669 ; It avoids checking '/' if
; '\' was found, so we must
; send '\' and then as much
; "../" as we want :)
.text:6063A655 push '/' ; This check won't be done
.text:6063A657 mov eax, [ebp+lp] ; because the '\' was found
.text:6063A65A mov ecx, [eax+20h]
.text:6063A65D push ecx
.text:6063A65E call \_strrchr
.text:6063A663 add esp, 8
.text:6063A666 mov [ebp+pSlashPosition], eax
.text:6063A669 loc\_6063A669:
.text:6063A669 cmp [ebp+pSlashPosition], 0 ; Check if a slash was
;found so
.text:6063A66D jz short loc\_6063A68C ; it
copies past it's ;position
.text:6063A66F push 200h
.text:6063A674 mov edx, [ebp+pSlashPosition]; Get the '\' position
and move
.text:6063A677 add edx, 1 ; forward 1 byte to avoid it
.text:6063A67A push edx
.text:6063A67B mov eax, [ebp+lp]
.text:6063A67E add eax, 4B0h
.text:6063A683 push eax
.text:6063A684 call ds:lstrcpynA ; From know on, the filename
.text:6063A68A jmp short loc\_6063A6A ; contains something like
; ../a.exe :)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
