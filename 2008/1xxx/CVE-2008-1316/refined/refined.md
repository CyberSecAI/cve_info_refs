      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_53e3099b_20250125_064522.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in the `qtf_ind_search_ov.php` script.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The application does not properly sanitize user input before using it in an SQL query. Specifically the 'id' parameter of the `qtf_ind_search_ov.php` is vulnerable."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can extract sensitive information, such as user passwords, from the database. This exploit specifically targets the MD5 hash of a user's password.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to `qtf_ind_search_ov.php` with a crafted 'id' parameter."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the target site's URL and a user ID for which they want to extract the password. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable page."
