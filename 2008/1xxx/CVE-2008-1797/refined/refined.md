Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2008-1797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A change in the behavior of newer Linux systems caused a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in Secure Computing Webwasher. A specially crafted URL sent to Webwasher on affected Linux systems causes the service to freeze.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to freeze the Webwasher service, making it unable to handle requests until restarted.
- Input Validation: The application fails to properly handle a specially crafted URL, leading to the service freeze.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Service Disruption: The Webwasher service becomes unavailable, preventing it from filtering web traffic. This can impact users' ability to access the internet through the proxy, potentially causing a significant business impact.
- Availability: The primary impact is the complete loss of availability of the Webwasher service until a manual restart.
- No confidentiality or integrity impacts were noted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack can be initiated remotely by sending a specially crafted URL to Webwasher.
- Internal or external: The attack can be launched by an internal user sending the URL directly to the Webwasher, or an external attacker by redirecting proxy users to the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Webwasher service.
- Crafting URL: The attacker needs the ability to create a specific crafted URL that triggers the vulnerability.
- No Authentication Required: The attack does not require prior authentication, enabling any user (internal or external) with the ability to send the URL.
- Knowledge of vulnerable systems: An attacker needs some basic knowledge of where the vulnerable server is running to send the malicious request to.

**Affected Versions:**
- Secure Computing Webwasher 6.6.3 build 3102 and older versions on CGLinux 4/5, RHEL 4, Debian 4, SLES10.
- Webwasher appliances version 6.x with CGLinux 4 or 5 prior to build 3150.
- Webwasher software versions on RedHat Enterprise Linux 4, Debian Linux 4, or Linux Suse Linue 10 prior to build 3150.

**Not Affected Versions:**
- Secure Computing Webwasher Builds 3150 and newer (all platforms).
- Webwasher (all versions) for Windows.
- Webwasher (all versions) for Solaris.
- Webwasher (all versions) for some Linux (RHEL 3, SLES8, SLES9, Debian 3).
- Webwasher 5.3 appliances (running CGLinux 3.x).

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade Webwasher to version 6.6.3 build 3150 or newer, or version 5.3.0 build 3159 or newer.
- Webwasher appliances can be upgraded via the GUI.

**Additional Details:**
- The CVSS base score is 7.1/10.
- The exploitability subscore is 8.6/10.
- The impact subscore is 6.9/10.
- The attack complexity is rated as medium.
- The availability impact is rated as complete.
- The vulnerability was disclosed by the National Australia Bank Security Assurance team.
- The proof of concept is an undisclosed handcrafted URL.
