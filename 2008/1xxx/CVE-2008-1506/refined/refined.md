Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities present in PEEL CMS, as exploited by the provided script:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The provided exploit script targets multiple vulnerabilities present in different versions of PEEL CMS, including:

*   **Login Guessing:** Exploits default credentials (e.g., "info@peel.fr/admin").
*   **Magic Quotes GPC Bypass:** Attempts to bypass security measures related to magic quotes being enabled/disabled. This is a PHP configuration setting that automatically adds backslashes to certain characters, which can be problematic for SQL queries.
*   **SQL Injection:** Exploits SQL injection vulnerabilities in multiple locations, specifically via `achat/historique_commandes.php`, to extract admin credentials. It uses `UNION SELECT` to retrieve user email and password hash. It also exploits a blind SQL injection vulnerability in `factures/facture_html.php`.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Leverages a vulnerability in the product addition functionality to upload a malicious PHP file disguised as an image. Then, it uploads another malicious PHP file via the previously uploaded file.
    
**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Default Credentials:** Using default or easily guessable credentials for the administrator account.
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and password hashes. Both standard and blind SQL injection techniques are used.
*   **Magic Quotes GPC Vulnerability:**  The script attempts to bypass security measures related to magic quotes being enabled/disabled, though this appears to be a less critical component than the other vulnerabilities.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The CMS allows the upload of files without proper validation, enabling attackers to upload malicious code (PHP scripts) disguised as legitimate files (images), leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Insecure Session Handling:** The script shows how to extract session IDs after successful login, which could be used for session hijacking, though this is not explicitly used by the script other than for authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** Successful exploitation leads to the extraction of administrator credentials, allowing complete control over the CMS.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The arbitrary file upload vulnerability allows the attacker to upload and execute any code on the server, leading to remote code execution (RCE) and full system compromise. This enables the attacker to deface the website, steal data, or use the server as part of a botnet.
*   **Data Breach:** The SQL injection vulnerabilities allow the attacker to extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Combining the vulnerabilities can lead to a complete system compromise, allowing attackers to take full control over the server and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacks are primarily performed through HTTP requests, leveraging GET and POST methods to interact with the vulnerable application.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack targets vulnerabilities accessible through the web interface of the PEEL CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable PEEL CMS instance.
*   **Basic Web Exploitation Skills:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests, SQL injection, and file upload vulnerabilities.
*   **Ability to Execute Scripts:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the provided PHP exploit script.
*   **No Prior Authentication (in many cases):** Many of the attacks can be done without any prior authentication but admin authentication helps in code execution.

**Summary:**

The provided exploit script demonstrates a severe security flaw in PEEL CMS, resulting from a combination of vulnerabilities that can lead to a complete compromise of the target system. The script combines multiple vulnerabilities to gain administrative access and ultimately achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This makes the application highly susceptible to exploitation.

This exploit script includes multiple vulnerabilities and can extract the admin password using login guessing, SQL injection, or blind SQL injection. It uses this to login and then exploit the file upload vulnerability to upload malicious code.
