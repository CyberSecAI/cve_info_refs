# libpng: Execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200804-15**

A vulnerability in libpng may allow for execution of arbitrary code in
certain applications that handle untrusted images.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libpng** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.26-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.26-r1** |

### Background

libpng is a free ANSI C library used to process and manipulate PNG
images.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered that libpng does
not handle zero-length unknown chunks in PNG files correctly, which
might lead to memory corruption in applications that call
png\_set\_read\_user\_chunk\_fn() or png\_set\_keep\_unknown\_chunks().

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to process a
specially crafted PNG image in an application using libpng and possibly
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application. Note that processing of unknown chunks is disabled by
default in most PNG applications, but some such as ImageMagick are
affected.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libpng users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.26-r1"
```

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- licq denial of service
By starting more than 1024 connections against a remote licq client,
attackers could cause licq to crash.
licq was fixed on openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- libpng crash or potential code execution
Specially crafted PNG image files could overwrite arbitrary memory.
Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute arbitrary code,
depending on the application used. (CVE-2008-1382)
Fixed libpng packages were shipped for all SUSE Linux based
distributions.
- Asterisk call without authorization
The opensource PBX asterisk allowed remote attackers to do a call
without prior login via the SIP channel. (CVE-2008-1332)
Asterisk packages were released for SUSE Linux 10.1 and openSUSE 10.2.
- openldap2 denial of service problem
Authenticated users could crash the LDAP server 'slapd' of openldap
via the 'NOOP' command (CVE-2007-6698,CVE-2008-0658)
openldap2 packages have been released for all distributions.
- audit buffer overflow in logging
A bug in the audit\_log\_user\_command() function could lead to a
buffer overflow. No program in openSUSE uses that function. Third
party applications could be affected though (CVE-2008-1628).
Updated audit packages were released for openSUSE 10.3.
- Blender buffer overflow
The rendering program Blender was affected by buffer overflows in
the RGBE header file parsing (CVE-2008-1102) and some temporary
file issues (CVE-2008-1103).
Since we do not think that Blender is not used in security critical
settings with network input data we fixed this problem only for
future products.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# POV-Ray: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200812-15**

POV-Ray includes a version of libpng that might allow for the execution of
arbitrary code when reading a specially crafted PNG file

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/povray** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.6.1-r4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.6.1-r4** |

### Background

POV-Ray is a well known open-source ray tracer.

### Description

POV-Ray uses a statically linked copy of libpng to view and output PNG
files. The version shipped with POV-Ray is vulnerable to CVE-2008-3964,
CVE-2008-1382, CVE-2006-3334, CVE-2006-0481, CVE-2004-0768. A bug in
POV-Ray's build system caused it to load the old version when your
installed copy of libpng was >=media-libs/libpng-1.2.10.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to load a specially crafted PNG file as
a texture, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All POV-Ray users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/povray-3.6.1-r4"
```

##### 3. Problem Description

a. VMware Descheduled Time Accounting driver vulnerability may cause a denial of service in Windows based virtual machines.

The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting Service is an optional,
experimental service that provides improved guest operating system
accounting.
This patch fixes a denial of service vulnerability that could be
triggered in a virtual machine by an unprivileged, locally
logged-on user in the virtual machine.
Virtual machines are affected under the following conditions:
- The virtual machine is running a Windows operating system.
- The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting driver is installed
in the virtual machine. Note that this is an optional (non-
default) part of the VMware Tools installation.
- The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting Service is not running
in the virtual machine
The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting Service is no longer provided
in newer versions of VMware Tools, starting with the versions
released in Fusion 2.0.2 and ESX 4.0.
However, virtual machines migrated from vulnerable releases will
still be vulnerable if the three conditions listed above are met,
until their tools are upgraded.
Steps needed to remediate this vulnerability:
Guest systems on VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion
- Install the new version of Workstation, Player, ACE, Server,
Fusion (see below for version information)
- Upgrade tools in the virtual machine (virtual machine users
will be prompted to upgrade).
Guest systems on ESX 3.5, ESXi 3.5, ESX 3.0.2, ESX 3.0.3
- Install the relevant patches (see below for patch identifiers)
- Manually upgrade tools in the virtual machine (virtual machine
users will not be prompted to upgrade). Note the VI Client will
not show the VMware tools is out of date in the summary tab.
Please see <http://tinyurl.com/27mpjo> page 80 for details.
Guests systems on ESX 4.0 and ESXi 4.0 that have been migrated from
ESX 3.5, ESXi 3.5, and ESX 3.0.x
- Install/upgrade the new tools in the virtual machine (virtual
machine users will be prompted to upgrade).
If the Descheduled Time Accounting driver was installed, the tools
upgrade will result in an updated driver for Workstation, Player,
ACE, Server, ESX 3.0.2, ESX 3.0.3, ESX 3.5, ESXi 3.5. For Fusion,
ESX 4.0, and ESXi 4.0 the tools upgrade will result in the removal
of the driver.
VMware would like to thank Nikita Tarakanov for reporting this
issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1805 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
(column 4) if a solution is available. See above for remediation
details.

b. Updated libpng package for the ESX 2.5.5 Service Console

The libpng packages contain a library of functions for creating and
manipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.
A flaw was discovered in libpng that could result in libpng trying
to free() random memory if certain, unlikely error conditions
occurred. If a carefully-crafted PNG file was loaded by an
application linked against libpng, it could cause the application
to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.
A flaw was discovered in the way libpng handled PNG images
containing "unknown" chunks. If an application linked against libpng
attempted to process a malformed, unknown chunk in a malicious PNG
image, it could cause the application to crash.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-0040 and CVE-2008-1382 to these
issues.
The VMware version number of libpng after applying the update is
libpng-1.0.14-12.i386.rpm.

(column 4) if a solution is available.

| [Description](#c0)  Erik Grinaker    2002-04-27 18:42:28 UTC  ``` The Ximian Evolution mail-client has a rather severe bug on Gentoo Linux. When I try adding addressbook-sources (in order to use LDAP addressbook), it simply segfaults. To reproduce; Select a contact-register, select "tools" from the menu, then "addressbook sources". When clicking add or edit the addressbook-component crashes.  I do not believe this to be a 100% Evolution bug, as this works perfectly on RedHat (and the SRPM contains the same tarball which the ebuild builds from). This could have something to do with a missing Glade UI schema, according to this post;  <http://lists.gentoo.org/pipermail/gentoo-desktop/2002-April/000005.html>   There has been created a bug at Ximian Bugzilla for this;  <http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=23099>  You might want to follow it and see what happens there. I have not done any extensive research on the problem, and it may very well be an error by Ximian - but I find it odd that this works on RedHat and not Gentoo. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robert Davis    2002-05-30 09:58:03 UTC  ``` Same problem here with 1.0.5.  The Ximian bug refrenced in the opening has been closed.  Any update? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Erik Grinaker    2002-06-11 06:20:04 UTC  ``` It is trivial to set up your LDAP addressbook manually by editing the file addressbook-sources.xml in your evolution directory. The problem is knowing the format. Here is how to set it up for LDAP, using binddn authentication (email authentication may be a bit different) :  <?xml version="1.0"?> <addressbooks>     <contactserver>         <name>My LDAP address book</name>         <description>LDAP address database</description>         <port>389</port>         <host>ldap.domain.com</host>         <rootdn>dc=domain,dc=com</rootdn>         <scope>sub</scope>         <authmethod>ldap/simple-binddn</authmethod>         <binddn>cn=Me,dc=domain,dc=com</binddn>     </contactserver> </addressbooks>  You will (obviously) need to fill in your own settings.  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Gregory Boyce    2002-06-12 21:14:38 UTC  ``` I've attempted to add an ldap source by copying what a co-worker had set in his file (he's using redhat with ximian gnome).  Same versions of evolution in both cases.  The new ldap server shows up properly within evolution, but connection fails.  The breakdown here seems to be more than just the ability to add (or modify) address book entries.  The ability for them to function properly is gone as well. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Erik Grinaker    2002-06-13 07:31:47 UTC  ``` Remember that you will need to have ldap in your USE variable when compiling Evolution for it to support LDAP addressbooks. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Gregory Boyce    2002-06-14 07:45:54 UTC  ``` I have ldap in my use settings.  When that didn't work, I emerged every package with ldap in the name and unmerged and merged evolution.  Still no help. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Gregory Boyce    2002-07-02 17:23:36 UTC  ``` Out of nowhere, ldap support now functions with the entries I added by hand.  I still don't have the ability to add or edit entries, but the ones that are put there by hand function properly. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Gabriele Giorgetti    2002-07-17 05:25:09 UTC  ``` This is an upsatream bug that has been fiexed in the 1.0.8 release of evolution, which will be in portage soon.  upstream bug: <http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=17332>  ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Dodi Ezra    2007-04-24 11:50:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 117126](attachment.cgi?id=117126 "Bug 2170") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=117126&action=edit "Bug 2170"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=117126&action=diff "Bug 2170")] [Bug 2170](show_bug.cgi?id=2170 "RESOLVED FIXED - Evolution crashes when trying to add an address book source (ldap)") ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Dodi Ezra    2007-04-24 11:52:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 117127](attachment.cgi?id=117127 "Bug 2170") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=117127&action=edit "Bug 2170"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=117127&action=diff "Bug 2170")] [Bug 2170](show_bug.cgi?id=2170 "RESOLVED FIXED - Evolution crashes when trying to add an address book source (ldap)") ``` |  |

Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2445 CVE-2007-5269 CVE-2008-1382 CVE-2008-5907 CVE-2008-6218 CVE-2009-0040
Debian Bug     : 446308 476669 516256 512665

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in libpng, a library for
reading and writing PNG files. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

The png_handle_tRNS function allows attackers to cause a denial of
service (application crash) via a grayscale PNG image with a bad tRNS
chunk CRC value. (CVE-2007-2445)

Certain chunk handlers allow attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) via crafted pCAL, sCAL, tEXt, iTXt, and ztXT chunking in PNG
images, which trigger out-of-bounds read operations. (CVE-2007-5269)

libpng allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a PNG file with zero
length "unknown" chunks, which trigger an access of uninitialized
memory. (CVE-2008-1382)

The png_check_keyword might allow context-dependent attackers to set the
value of an arbitrary memory location to zero via vectors involving
creation of crafted PNG files with keywords. (CVE-2008-5907)

A memory leak in the png_handle_tEXt function allows context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) via a crafted
PNG file. (CVE-2008-6218)

libpng allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PNG
file that triggers a free of an uninitialized pointer in (1) the
png_read_png function, (2) pCAL chunk handling, or (3) setup of 16-bit
gamma tables. (CVE-2009-0040)

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version1.2.15~beta5-1+etch2.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.27-2+lenny2.  (Only CVE-2008-5907, CVE-2008-5907 and
CVE-2009-0040 affect the stable distribution.)

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.35-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.

# libpng: Execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200804-15**

A vulnerability in libpng may allow for execution of arbitrary code in
certain applications that handle untrusted images.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libpng** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.26-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.26-r1** |

### Background

libpng is a free ANSI C library used to process and manipulate PNG
images.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered that libpng does
not handle zero-length unknown chunks in PNG files correctly, which
might lead to memory corruption in applications that call
png\_set\_read\_user\_chunk\_fn() or png\_set\_keep\_unknown\_chunks().

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to process a
specially crafted PNG image in an application using libpng and possibly
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application. Note that processing of unknown chunks is disabled by
default in most PNG applications, but some such as ImageMagick are
affected.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libpng users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.26-r1"
```

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: The "login" command always runs the default shell with normal priority

  Description: The "login" command starts an interactive shell after a local user is authenticated. The priority level for the interactive shell is reset to the system default, which can cause the shell to run with an unexpectedly high priority. This update addresses the issue by respecting the priority setting of the calling process if the caller is the superuser or the user who was successfully logged in.

* **telnet**

More details about this issue may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1382  Additional information can be found in the libpng source, or in this file on the libpng FTP site:    ftp://ftp.simplesystems.org/pub/libpng/png/src/libpng-1.2.27-README.txt   Here are the details from the Slackware 12.0 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/libpng-1.2.27-i486-1_slack12.0.tgz:   Upgraded to libpng-1.2.27.   This fixes various bugs, the most important of which have to do with the   handling of unknown chunks containing zero-length data.  Processing a PNG   image that contains these could cause the application using libpng to crash   (possibly resulting in a denial of service), could potentially expose the   contents of uninitialized memory, or could cause the execution of arbitrary   code as the user running libpng (though it would probably be quite difficult   to cause the execution of attacker-chosen code).  We recommend upgrading the   package as soon as possible.   For more information, see:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1382     ftp://ftp.simplesystems.org/pub/libpng/png/src/libpng-1.2.27-README.txt   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
