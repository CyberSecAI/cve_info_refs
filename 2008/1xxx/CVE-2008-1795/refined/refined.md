{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist within the Blackboard Academic Suite.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
	  "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's session. This can lead to: \n\n*   **Account compromise:** Stealing user credentials, changing user email, and gaining full access to user accounts.\n*   **Data theft:** Logging user information (emails, names, grades) and sending it to an attacker.\n*   **Worm propagation:** Creating a self-propagating web-based worm to spread through the system by sending infected links via email and posting malicious announcements. The worm can log user information or perform other actions based on the attacker's intent.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript in the `searchText` parameter of the `viewCatalog` page.",
	  "Injection of malicious JavaScript in the `subject` field of announcements via the `announcement.pl` page.",
      "Sending emails containing malicious links."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a valid user of the Blackboard system to exploit the vulnerabilities and have the ability to create announcements and send emails. In addition, social engineering may be used to trick users into clicking malicious links.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is demonstrated through proof-of-concept code (steal.js and BBworm.js) which steals user info and creates a worm respectively."
