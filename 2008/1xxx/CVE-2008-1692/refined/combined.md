# Multiple X11 terminals: Local privilege escalation — GLSA **200805-03**

A vulnerability was found in aterm, Eterm, Mrxvt, multi-aterm, RXVT,
rxvt-unicode, and wterm, allowing for local privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-terms/aterm** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1-r1** |

| Package | **x11-terms/eterm** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.4-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.4-r1** |

| Package | **x11-terms/mrxvt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.5.3-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.5.3-r2** |

| Package | **x11-terms/multi-aterm** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.2.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.2.1-r1** |

| Package | **x11-terms/rxvt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.7.10-r4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.7.10-r4** |

| Package | **x11-terms/rxvt-unicode** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.02-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.02-r1** |

| Package | **x11-terms/wterm** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.2.9-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.2.9-r3** |

### Background

Aterm, Eterm, Mrxvt, multi-aterm, RXVT, rxvt-unicode, and wterm are X11
terminal emulators.

### Description

Bernhard R. Link discovered that RXVT opens a terminal on :0 if the
"-display" option is not specified and the DISPLAY environment variable
is not set. Further research by the Gentoo Security Team has shown that
aterm, Eterm, Mrxvt, multi-aterm, rxvt-unicode, and wterm are also
affected.

### Impact

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to hijack X11
terminals of other users.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All aterm users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-terms/aterm-1.0.1-r1"
```

All Eterm users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-terms/eterm-0.9.4-r1"
```

All Mrxvt users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-terms/mrxvt-0.5.3-r2"
```

All multi-aterm users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-terms/multi-aterm-0.2.1-r1"
```

All RXVT users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-terms/rxvt-2.7.10-r4"
```

All rxvt-unicode users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-terms/rxvt-unicode-9.02-r1"
```

All wterm users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-terms/wterm-6.2.9-r3"
```

# CVE-2008-1692

| **Name** | CVE-2008-1692 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Eterm 0.9.4 opens a terminal window on :0 if -display is not specified and the DISPLAY environment variable is not set, which might allow local users to hijack X11 connections. NOTE: realistic attack scenarios require that the victim enters a command on the wrong machine. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Lars Hartmann    2008-04-08 07:38:09 UTC  ``` A security issue has been reported in Eterm, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges.  For more information: SA29576  The security issue is reported in version 0.9.4. Other versions may also be affected.  Solution: Do not run Eterm on untrusted systems.  Restrict local access to trusted users only.  Provided and/or discovered by: Reported in a Debian bug report by Bernhard R. Link. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-04-08 09:01:51 UTC  ``` There's a patch here: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=473127>  As I wrote here, this affects a lot of shells besides aterm and rxvt (which we do not have a bug for yet): [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/107/focus=173](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/107/focus%3D173)  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2008-04-08 17:31:53 UTC  ``` i dont think you want the term "terminals", not "shells"  but along those lines, it isnt just a terminal issue ... many many applications will attempt :0 if nothing else is set ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-04-15 23:34:07 UTC  ``` true, we're talking terminals here, not shells. The reason it is dangerous in terminals (as opposed to other X11 applications) is that they allow you to execute code directly, whereas if someone captures your "gimp" for instance, getting it to start a shell for you is hard.  There's a patch for eterm here: <http://people.debian.org/~nion/nmu-diff/eterm-0.9.4.0debian1-2_0.9.4.0debian1-2.1.patch>  Since these bugs need fixing all over the place, we need bugs for every affected package.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2008-04-16 03:14:01 UTC  ``` considering gimp can trivially overwrite arbitrary files via its save interface, i'd say that's just as bad as a shell when it comes to security. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2008-04-16 03:26:33 UTC  ``` ive committed the fix in question in upstream eterm cvs as well as added it to eterm-0.9.4-r1 ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-04-26 16:38:32 UTC  ``` Arches please test and mark stable x11-terms/eterm-0.9.4-r1 target "alpha amd64 arm hppa ia64 ~mips ppc ppc64 release sh sparc x86 ~x86-fbsd"  not sure about the real impact, but secunia mentions privileges escalation, so...  ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Víctor Enríquez    2008-04-26 18:07:57 UTC  ``` ===AMD64 AT REPORT===  *Installation [OK] using the following USE flags.

Package: eterm
Version: 0.9.4.0debian1-2
Severity: important
Tags: security patch

When no -display is given and DISPLAY is not set, Eterm tries :0.
That is both a security issue on multi-user systems (see
<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/122>
for the description of an attack vector) and otherwise still annoying
as it causes the error message to be delayed quite a bit.

Hochachtungsvoll,

Hi,
as far as I can see your patch is wrong cause it completely
removes the usage of the DISPLAY variable.

Attached is a correct patch I will upload as NMU.
It will be also archived on:
<http://people.debian.org/~nion/nmu-diff/eterm-0.9.4.0debian1-2_0.9.4.0debian1-2.1.patch>

BTW the -display option seems to be broken anyway, Eterm -display :0.0
doesn't work while DISPLAY=:0.0 Eterm does fine. I will not
analyze this in more detail as it was broken before too.

Kind regards
Nico
