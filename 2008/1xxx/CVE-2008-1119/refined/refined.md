```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `get_image.php` script which improperly handles the `img` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization of the `img` parameter in the `get_image.php` script."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server by manipulating the `img` parameter to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`). This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including configuration files (like `oreon.conf.php` containing database credentials) and system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP request to `get_image.php` with a modified `img` parameter containing directory traversal sequences.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is needed."
