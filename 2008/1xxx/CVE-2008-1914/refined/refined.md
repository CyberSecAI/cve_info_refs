    "description": "NOINFO",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in BigAnt Server version 2.2 when handling HTTP GET requests.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Improper input validation"
      ],
