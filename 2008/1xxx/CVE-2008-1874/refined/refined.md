```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the 'reed' parameter of the `/account/user/mail.html` page. The application fails to properly sanitize user input passed to the 'reed' parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials. This can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and potentially complete compromise of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `/account/user/mail.html` with a malicious payload in the `reed` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a valid username and password for the application to log in and access the vulnerable page. The attacker also needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application."
