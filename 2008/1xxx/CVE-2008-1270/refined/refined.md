Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2008-1270:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `mod_userdir` module of lighttpd. When this module is loaded but the `userdir.path` configuration option is not explicitly set, it defaults to ".", which represents the home directory of the user.
-  If no `userdir.path` configuration is provided, the module defaults to using the user's home directory as the document root for user-specific requests.
- If a user's home directory was "/", which is the root directory, this means the entire server file system becomes accessible via userdir requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Default:** The module's default behavior of using "." for `userdir.path` when not configured is the primary weakness.
- **Information Disclosure:** Allowing access to the server's root directory through `mod_userdir` can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can use the vulnerability to read any world-readable file on the server.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can gain access to sensitive files, potentially including configuration files, password hashes, and other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests. An attacker can send a request to the server using a URL of the form `http://<server>/~<username>/<file-path>`, where `<username>` is a valid user (e.g., "nobody") and `<file-path>` points to the file that the attacker wants to read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs remote access to the vulnerable lighttpd server.
- **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker can simply send a crafted HTTP request.

**Additional Details**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Julien Cayzac and tracked as issue #1587 in the lighttpd project's issue tracker.
- The lighttpd team addressed this issue by making `userdir.path` a required setting to enable `mod_userdir` functionality. The old behaviour is achievable by setting it to ""
- Gentoo assigned a C3 status to the issue and created a GLSA (Gentoo Linux Security Advisory) to alert users.
- Debian also released a security advisory (DSA 1521-1) to address the vulnerability in its distribution.
- OpenSUSE also acknowledged the vulnerability as part of their SUSE Security Summary Report SUSE-SR:2008:08
