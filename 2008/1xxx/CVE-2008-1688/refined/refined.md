Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1688:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `m4` macro processor handled file names when using the `-F` (freeze) option. Specifically, it involved passing a raw file name as a format string to `printf`, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The core issue is a format string vulnerability in the `produce_frozen_state` function within `src/freeze.c`.  By passing a file name as a `printf` format string, a malicious filename containing format specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%n`, etc.) could be crafted by an attacker which would be interpreted by `printf` and could potentially lead to memory corruption, data leakage or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could craft a malicious filename that, when used with the `-F` option, would allow them to execute arbitrary code on the system.
*   **Core dump:** The `-F` option would cause a core dump when used with the `-t undefined` option.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `-F` command-line option of the `m4` program, by providing a specially crafted filename.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the filename used with the `m4` command's `-F` option. This could potentially be achieved through various means, such as controlling an input file, or when the m4 program is used in an automated build process.

**Additional Details:**

* The fix was to ensure that the file name is no longer passed as a raw format string to `printf`.
*   The vulnerability was present since the introduction of the `-F` option in `m4` version 1.3.
* The fix was included in m4-1.4.11
* Slackware was one of the distributions that issued a security update for this vulnerability.
