Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1121:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw present in the `eazyPortal` application, specifically version 1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `$_COOKIE` variable named `session_vars`. By crafting a malicious cookie value, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
*   **Account Takeover:** With stolen credentials, attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts, including administrative accounts.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** Successful SQL injection could allow attackers to modify or delete data in the database, or execute other malicious queries.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request that includes a malicious `session_vars` cookie.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The exploit involves manipulating the `session_vars` cookie by encoding a malicious SQL query within it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `eazyPortal` application.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs a fundamental understanding of HTTP headers and how cookies are used.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs an understanding of how SQL queries are structured to inject malicious code effectively.
*  **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the application.

**Additional Details (from exploit code):**

*   The provided exploit script first retrieves the database table prefix by sending an initial request and parsing the response.
*   The exploit constructs a malicious SQL query using `UNION SELECT` to retrieve user password hashes.
*   The exploit utilizes `base64_encode` function to encode the crafted SQL query for the cookie.
*   The exploit then sends HTTP requests with the crafted cookie to extract the password hash and username from the database.
* The exploit uses a flawed query, which is noted with a comment `#fucked up query but it works :)`
