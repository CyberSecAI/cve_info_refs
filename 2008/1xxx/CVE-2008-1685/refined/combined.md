## C compilers may silently discard some wraparound checks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#162289

Original Release Date: 2008-04-04 | Last Revised: 2008-10-08

---

### Overview

Some C compilers optimize away pointer arithmetic overflow tests that depend on undefined behavior without providing a diagnostic (a warning). Applications containing these tests may be vulnerable to buffer overflows if compiled with these compilers.

### Description

| In the C language, given the following types:  char \*buf;        int len;some C compilers will assume that buf+len >= buf. As a result, code that performs wrapping checks similar to the following:len = 1<<30;[...]if(buf+len < buf)  /\* wrap check \*/   [...overflow occurred...]are optimized out by these compilers; no object code to perform the check will appear in the resulting executable program. In the case where the wrap test expression is optimized out, a subsequent manipulation of len [could cause an overflow](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/x/SgHm). As a result, applications that perform such checks may be vulnerable to buffer overflows.Wrapping checks that use methods similar to the one described above depend on undefined behavior. Conforming implementations are permitted to perform the optimization by the [ISO/IEC 9899:1999 C specification](http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1124.pdf) (§6.5.6p8) as undefined behavior. Even if a conforming implementation currently generates object code for an undefined behavior, future versions of the compiler are not obligated to do the same; this behavior may be viewed as an opportunity for further optimization. To ensure that such changes to the compiler do not invalidate assumptions, developers should follow the recommendations described in CERT C Secure Coding recommendation [MSC15-C](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/x/EoLu) and rule [ARR38-C](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/x/SgHm) to avoid this error. Furthermore, compilers are not required to issue diagnostics for undefined behavior, so there is frequently no easy way to identify undefined behavior in code, particularly during manual code audits. Note that this issue does not strictly constitute a vulnerability in the compilers themselves. Rather, this behavior may introduce vulnerabilities in applications that include similar code and are compiled with affected compiler implementations. Existing code that relies on the undefined behavior in the wrapping check is particularly susceptible to this behavior.Multiple implementations are known to perform this optimization. This optimization may be affected by the setting of the optimization level as well as other flags. Additional information about affected implementations can be found in the Systems Affected section of this document. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An application that performs wrapping checks based on an expression such as the one described above may be vulnerable to buffer overflow if compiled with affected compiler implementations. The nature of the resulting vulnerability would be specific to the application and depends on how the affected code is used. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Use casts**Cast objects of type char\* to uintptr\_t before comparison. The faulty wrapping check listed above would be written#include <stdint.h>[...]if((uintptr\_t)buf+len < (uintptr\_t)buf)   [...]Alternatively, developers can use size\_t on platforms that do not provide the uintptr\_t type. Developers should also follow the recommendations described in CERT C Secure Coding rule [ARR38-C](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/x/SgHm).**Avoid affected compiler implementations**Application developers and vendors of large codebases that cannot be audited for use of the defective wrapping checks are urged to avoid using compiler implementations that perform the offending optimization. Vendors and developers should carefully evaluate the conditions under which their compiler may perform the offending optimization. In some cases, downgrading the version of the compiler in use or sticking with versions of the compiler that do not perform the offending optimization may mitigate resulting vulnerabilities in applications. |

### [GNU Compiler Collection](#CRDY-7DWKWM) Affected

Updated:  July 29, 2008

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The behaviour of pointer overflow has now changed as of the following
(as yet unreleased) versions:

gcc 4.2.4
gcc 4.3.1
gcc 4.4.0

and all subsequent versions (4.2.x where x >= 4, 4.3.y where y >= 1,
4.z where z >= 4).

The optimization under discussion is for comparisons between P + V1
and P + V2, where P is the same pointer and V1 and V2 are variables of
some integer type.  The C/C++ language standards permit this to be
reduced to a comparison between V1 and V2.  However, if V1 or V2 are
such that the sum with P overflows, then the comparison of V1 and V2
will not yield the same result as actually computing P + V1 and P + V2
and comparing the sums.

The new behaviour as of the above releases is that this optimization
is performed by default at -O2 and above, including -Os.  It is not
performed by default at -O1 or (of course) -O0.  The optimization may
be enabled for -O1 with the -fstrict-overflow option.  The
optimization may be disabled for -O2 and above with the
-fno-strict-overflow option.

When the optimization is enabled, cases where it occurs may be
detected by using -Wstrict-overflow=N where N >= 3.  Note that using
this warning option is likely to yield a number of false positive
reports--cases where this or other overflow optimizations are being
applied, but where there is no actual problem.

Please see the gcc manual for more information about these options.

### Vendor Information

We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

Vendors and developers using the GNU C compiler should consider using versions of GCC that do not perform the optimization such as those listed above or [GCC 4.1.2](http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.1/) or earlier versions (but NOT 4.1.0).

If you have feedback, comments, or additional information about this vulnerability, please send us email.

### [Intel Corporation](#MIMG-7DSQAV) Not Affected

Notified:  April 17, 2008  Updated: April 25, 2008

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

I tried the given program with our compiler on IA32 linux (Where int and
ptr are both 32 bits).  I couldn't ever get it to optimize the test away.  It may be
possible under some circumstances to get this to happen, but the test case sent
doesn't show that for me.  I tried icc -O1, -O2, and -O3 levels of optimization,
and none of them showed the problem.

(-3B) = (0xfff...7) > 396B, so the result is always true.  4.0 does not have final value replacement, and 4.2 has different # of iterations analysis; but most likely some similar problem is latent in both versions. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=26763#c4)  Zdenek Dvorak    2006-03-28 12:08:25 UTC  ``` With this testcase, problem reproduces both in 4.1 and in mainline:  int try (int *a) {   return a + -1 > a; }  int main(void) {   int bla[100];    if (try (bla + 50))     abort ();    return 0; }  ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=26763#c5)  Richard Biener    2006-03-28 13:33:04 UTC  ``` We had this some time ago, but the discussion stopped at the point where people said that pointers do not wrap.

I'm not a language lawyer here - and as this is the second (or third)  patch to this folding to correct problems I'd rather be safe than sorry  this time.  I'm sure jsm can construct a testcase where comparing offsets as signed leads to wrong code.

A corner case, but valid I  > guess.  no -- the result in this example is undefined.  The comparisons are only defined for pointers in the same object.
