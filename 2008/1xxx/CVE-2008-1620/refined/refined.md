```
CVE-2008-1620:
- Root cause of vulnerability: The 2X TFTP Service is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the use of "..." sequences instead of ".." to navigate parent directories.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Directory traversal vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can read files outside of the intended TFTP root directory. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files (boot.ini, win.ini).
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the TFTP service.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send TFTP requests to the vulnerable server.
