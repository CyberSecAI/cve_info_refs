Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1730:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **Remote Local File Inclusion (LFI)** flaw in the `download.html` file of the "Free Photo Gallery Site Script".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The `path` parameter in the `download.html` script is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.
*   **File Inclusion:** The application includes the file specified by the unsanitized `path` parameter, leading to the disclosure of sensitive files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can read the content of arbitrary files on the server that the web server user has permission to access. This includes sensitive files like configuration files (e.g., `config.inc.php`, as demonstrated in the exploit example), which could reveal database credentials or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `download.html` script.
*   **Malicious Path Parameter:** The attacker includes a `path` parameter with a path to a local file. Example: `download.html?path=config.inc.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server to send HTTP requests to the `download.html` script.
*   **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of file paths on the target server to exploit the LFI and read the content of sensitive files.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is an LFI issue caused by the improper handling of the `path` parameter in `download.html`. Attackers can exploit this by including paths to sensitive files and reading their contents, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information such as database credentials or other server configuration details.
