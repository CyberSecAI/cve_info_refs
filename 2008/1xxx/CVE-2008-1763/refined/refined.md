```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application directly uses user-supplied input from the 'id_art' GET parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries. In this specific example, it is shown how to extract username, password, and email from the 'membre' table.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the 'id_art' parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
