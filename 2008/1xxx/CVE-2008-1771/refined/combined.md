How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
Package: mt-daapd
Version: 0.9~r1696-1.2
Severity: grave

Hi,
I found a security issue in mt-daapd:

This is an integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow in
the ws_getpostvars function.

>From src/webserver.c:
   707  int ws_getpostvars(WS_CONNINFO *pwsc) {
   708      char *content_length;
   709      unsigned char *buffer;
   710      uint32_t length;
   711      uint32_t ms;
            ....
   715      content_length = ws_getarg(&pwsc->request_headers,"Content-Length");
            ....
   722      length=atoi(content_length);
   723      ws_dprintf(L_WS_DBG,"Thread %d: Post var length: %d\n",
   724              pwsc->threadno,length);
   725
   726      buffer=(unsigned char*)malloc(length+1);
            ....
   739      if(!io_read_timeout(pwsc->hclient, buffer, &length, &ms)) {
            ....
   757
   758      if(!ws_getgetvars(pwsc,(char*)buffer)) {
   759          /* assume error was set already */
   760          free(buffer);
   761          ws_dprintf(L_WS_LOG,"Could not parse get vars\n");
   762          return FALSE;
   763      }
   764
   765      free(buffer);

The relevant variable here is length, it is of type uint32_t. In line
715 content_length points to the user supplied Content-Length value in the HTTP POST.
This value gets then converted to an integer using atoi in line 722.

Here integer conversion happens on negative values. A value of -1 will set length to
UINT_MAX because length is of type uint32_t. Then the length value is used to
allocate space on the heap. Adding + 1 in the malloc call triggers an integer overflow.
With a Content-Length: -1 the buffer size (UINT_MAX + 1) buffer size passed to malloc
will be 0. This causes malloc to allocate the smallest possible chunk but it does not fail.

In line 739 a timed read is done on the buffer. io_read_timeout() (from src/io.c)
basically ends up calling io_read and reading length bytes into the buffer and writing
the count of read bytes back to length. So there is a heap-based buffer overflow here.

This corrupts the heap structure and leads to a server crash in line 765 when freeing the
buffer which is now corrupted.

This is a remote DoS for _unauthenticated_ users and does possibly lead to arbitrary code
execution

A very simple PoC attached.

[CVE-2008-1771](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1771) was assigned to this, please mention this CVE id in the changelog if you
fix this bug.

Kind regards

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : mt-daapd
Vulnerability  : multiple vulnerabilities
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-5824 CVE-2007-5825 CVE-2008-1771
Debian Bug     : 459961 476241

Three vulnerabilities have been discovered in the mt-daapd DAAP audio
server (also known as the Firefly Media Server).  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following three
problems:

CVE-2007-5824

    Insufficient validation and bounds checking of the Authorization:
    HTTP header enables a heap buffer overflow, potentially enabling
    the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-5825

    Format string vulnerabilities in debug logging within the
    authentication of XML-RPC requests could enable the execution of
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1771

    An integer overflow weakness in the handling of HTTP POST
    variables could allow a heap buffer overflow and potentially
    arbitrary code execution.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.2.4+r1376-1.1+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9~r1696-1.3.

We recommend that you upgrade your mt-daapd package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
