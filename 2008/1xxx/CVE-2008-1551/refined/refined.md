```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The RunCMS Photo module version 3.02 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the 'cid' parameter in the viewcat.php script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can extract sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords, from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries through the 'cid' parameter.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to `modules/photo/viewcat.php` by manipulating the 'cid' parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server hosting the RunCMS application with the vulnerable photo module installed.
