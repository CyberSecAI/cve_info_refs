title: openMosix userspace library stack-based buffer overflow
Discovered by: Jose Carlos Norte
There are a lot of buffer overflows present in the library of the openMosix project, documented at:
http://www.openmosixview.com/docs/openMosixAPI.html
The vulnerable code is in:
http://openmosix.cvs.sourceforge.net/openmosix/userspace-tools/moslib/li
bmosix.c?revision=1.6&view=markup
134 int64\_t
135 msx\_readnode(int node, const char \*item)
136 {
137 char fn[40];
138 int64\_t val;
139
140 if(!node && !(node = msx\_read("/proc/hpc/admin/mospe")))
141 return(-1);
142 sprintf(fn, "/proc/hpc/nodes/%d/%s", node, item);
in line 142 there is no check against overflow in "item" argument.
Every applications using this library, can be vulnerable to attacks exploiting this flaw.
