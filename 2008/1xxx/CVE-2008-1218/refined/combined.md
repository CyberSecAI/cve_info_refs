Debian Security Advisory DSA-1516-1                security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Florian Weimer
March 14, 2008                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : dovecot
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1199 CVE-2008-1218
Debian Bug     : 469457

Prior to this update, the default configuration for Dovecot used by
Debian runs the server daemons with group mail privileges.  This means
that users with write access to their mail directory by other means
(for example, through an SSH login) could read mailboxes owned by
other users for which they do not have direct write access
(CVE-2008-1199).  In addition, an internal interpretation conflict in
password handling has been addressed proactively, even though it is
not known to be exploitable (CVE-2008-1218).

Note that applying this update requires manual action: The
configuration setting "mail_extra_groups = mail" has been replaced
with "mail_privileged_group = mail".  The update will show a
configuration file conflict in /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.  It is
recommended that you keep the currently installed configuration file,
and change the affected line.  For your reference, the sample
configuration (without your local changes) will have been written to
/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.dpkg-new.

If your current configuration uses mail_extra_groups with a value
different from "mail", you may have to resort to the
mail_access_groups configuration directive.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.rc15-2etch4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.13-1.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), no updates are provided.
We recommend that you consider upgrading to the stable distribution.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

SUSE Security Summary Report
Announcement ID: SUSE-SR:2008:020
Date: Tue, 07 Oct 2008 07:00:00 +0000
Cross-References: CVE-2007-6598, CVE-2008-1199, CVE-2008-1218
CVE-2008-3134, CVE-2008-4109, CVE-2008-4297
Content of this advisory:
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities:
- dovecot
- GraphicsMagick
- openssh
- mercurial
2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds:
none
3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- dovecot
When configured with 'mail\_extra\_groups' dovecot potentially allowed
users to read mail boxes of other users. This is not the
case in the default configuration of openSUSE (CVE-2008-1199).
By using tab characters in passwords remote attackers could
potentially acquire unauthorized access (CVE-2008-1218).
Flaws in caching LDAP data could lead to users getting logged in
with the wrong account (CVE-2007-6598).
Affected: 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- GraphicsMagick
Specially crafted image files could crash GraphicsMagick (CVE-2008-3134).
Affected: 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- openssh
Due to a faulty signal handler repeated login attempts could exhaust
the maximum allowed connections and prevent further logins
(CVE-2008-4109).
A problem where utmp entries where not deleted when users logged
out was also fixed.
Affected: SLES10
- mercurial
The hgweb script didn't enforce the 'allowpull' permission setting
which allowed anyone to retrieve files from the repository
(CVE-2008-4297)
Affected: 11.0

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

<http://dovecot.org/releases/1.1/rc/dovecot-1.1.rc3.tar.gz.sig>

Note that the changes for the security hole fix were quite large. I
tested with several auth configurations myself and they seemed to work,
but it's possible I left a bug somewhere in there breaking someone's
configuration. So make sure to test that it works after upgrading.

Of course it would be really nice if Dovecot had a proper test suite
where testing all configurations could be automated and run before each
release. I've already started this with my imaptest tool
(<http://imapwiki.org/ImapTest>), but it only does IMAP tests and a lot of
things are still missing. Some help would be nice here.

	* Fixed a security hole in blocking passdbs (MySQL always. PAM, passwd
	  and shadow if blocking=yes) where user could specify extra fields
	  in the password. The main problem here is when specifying
	  "skip_password_check" introduced in v1.0.11 for fixing master user
	  logins, allowing the user to log in as anyone without a valid
	  password.

	- mail_privileged_group was broken in some systems (OS X, Solaris?)
	- IMAP THREAD: Fixed some correctness problems

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Dovecot: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-25**

Two vulnerabilities in Dovecot allow for information disclosure and
argument injection.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-mail/dovecot** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.13-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.13-r1** |

### Background

Dovecot is a lightweight, fast and easy to configure IMAP and POP3 mail
server.

### Description

Dovecot uses the group configured via the "mail\_extra\_groups" setting,
which should be used to create lockfiles in the /var/mail directory,
when accessing arbitrary files (CVE-2008-1199). Dovecot does not escape
TAB characters in passwords when saving them, which might allow for
argument injection in blocking passdbs such as MySQL, PAM or shadow
(CVE-2008-1218).

### Impact

Remote attackers can exploit the first vulnerability to disclose
sensitive data, such as the mail of other users, or modify files or
directories that are writable by group via a symlink attack. Please
note that the "mail\_extra\_groups" setting is set to the "mail" group by
default when the "mbox" USE flag is enabled.

The second vulnerability can be abused to inject arguments for internal
fields. No exploitation vectors are known for this vulnerability that
affect previously stable versions of Dovecot in Gentoo.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Dovecot users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/dovecot-1.0.13-r1"
```

This version removes the "mail\_extra\_groups" option and introduces a
"mail\_privileged\_group" setting which is handled safely.

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:03:45 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached Numeric-20.3.ebuild.  This is an update for use with python-2.1  It can be tested by starting a python shell (need a PPM image viewer installed: tkinter will suffice) and >>>from NumTut import * >>>view(greece)  should see a pretty picture.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:05:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10](attachment.cgi?id=10 "Numeric-20.3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=10&action=edit "Numeric-20.3.ebuild")] Numeric-20.3.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:06:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 11](attachment.cgi?id=11 "Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=11&action=edit "Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff")] Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 21:17:27 UTC  ``` This ebuild gives a Access violtion when run through the sandbox.  --------------------------- ACCESS VIOLATION SUMMARY ---------------------------LOG FILE = "/tmp/sandbox-Numeric-20.3-15709.log"  unlink:    /usr/lib/python2.1/distutils/command/install_headers.pyc open_wr:   /usr/lib/python2.1/distutils/command/install_headers.pyc -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-05 03:51:53 UTC  ``` The sandbox violation seems to be python version related.  I don't get a violation building against python-2.2. I even doubted that sandbox was working so I added a 'echo "fail" > /home/tod/tmp/fail.test' to the ebuild install function, and it then generated a access violation (sandbox is nice!).    Bottom line.  The simple fix seems to be change the depends to >=python-2.2 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-10 07:34:59 UTC  ``` added dep on >=python 2.2   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [Dovecot-news] Security hole #6: Some passdbs allowed users to log in without a valid password

```
This affects only blocking passdbs:

 - MySQL
 - PAM, passwd and shadow if blocking=yes

The underlying bug exists in all v1.0.x versions, but I couldn't figure
out a way to exploit it except with v1.0.11, v1.0.12 and v1.1.rc2.
Probably a good idea to upgrade in any case.

The main problem is that Dovecot's internal protocols use TAB character
as a delimiter, but passwords were sent unescaped through them. So
passwords containing TAB characters allowed to add new internal fields.
The main problem here is a new "skip_password_check" field added in
v1.0.11 to fix problems with master user logins. Specifying this field
allowed the user to skip the password check, as the name implies.

This has been fixed thoroughly in v1.0.13 and v1.1.rc3 to make sure
there are no more escaping problems with any fields, but it can be also
fixed with a less intrusive patch for v1.0:
