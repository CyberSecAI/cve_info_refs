  "CVE-2008-1218": {
    "description": "An internal interpretation conflict in password handling within Dovecot has been addressed. The vulnerability arises due to a lack of proper escaping of TAB characters in passwords when saved, potentially leading to argument injection in blocking passdbs such as MySQL, PAM, or shadow if blocking=yes.  This could allow an attacker to inject internal fields, most notably `skip_password_check=1` which would allow authentication to succeed without providing a valid password.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Lack of proper escaping of TAB characters in passwords.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Argument injection",
        "Insufficient input sanitization"
       ],
        "impact": "Remote attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to user accounts by injecting malicious parameters into the authentication process, bypassing password checks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote, by providing a crafted password containing TAB characters"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Requires the ability to attempt a login to the Dovecot service.",
       "affected_configurations": "Dovecot versions prior to 1.0.13 and 1.1.rc3, with blocking passdbs (MySQL, PAM, passwd, or shadow) and the 'skip_password_check' feature enabled."
