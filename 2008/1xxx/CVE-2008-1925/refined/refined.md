{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'namesx' and 'uhnames' modules in InspIRCd do not properly validate network input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can trigger a denial of service (daemon crash) by sending specially crafted IRC commands.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted IRC commands to the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with the ability to send IRC commands to the vulnerable server. The attacker needs to load both the namesx and uhnames modules on the server, set specific length values for nick, ident and channel, and join a channel with many users with long nicks/idents/hostnames before a final user joins using uhnames."
