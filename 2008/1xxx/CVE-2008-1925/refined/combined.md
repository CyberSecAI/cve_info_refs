Message-ID:  <87k5ipmwv3.fsf@lillypad.riseup.net>
Date:  Tue, 22 Apr 2008 16:57:04 -0400
From:  Micah Anderson <micah@...eup.net>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject:  CVE Request: inspircd

Versions prior to 1.1.17 of InspIRCd are vulnerable to a remotely
triggerable buffer overflow which can lead to a Denial of Service
(daemon crash) when the namesx and uhnames modules are loaded.

InspIRCd is a modular C++ IRCd (IRC daemon) for Linux, BSD, Windows and
Apple OS X systems created to provide a stable, modern, and lightweight
IRCd written from scratch.

Reference: <http://inspircd.org/forum/showthread.php?t=2945>

How the issue can be triggered:

if you load both the namesx and uhnames modules, then set your nicklen
to 31 characters and your ident len is 12 and and your channel len is
64, then you can crash the ircd by joining a lot of users to a channel
with 31 char nicks, 12 char idents and very long hostnames, and then
joining a single final user to the channel who has uhnames

workaround: unload uhnames or upgrade to 1.1.17

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

You SHOULD upgrade to it ASAP as it contains security fixes. ... If you use a version prior to 1.1.18 and you do NOT use m_namesx, you should update to 1.1.18 on the fly, then load m_namesx to avoid using code vulnerable to a crash.  If you use either uhnames or namesx, you should reload both of those modules after upgrading. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-04-01 14:04:56 UTC  ``` I wrote an email to Craig Edwards to see whether he has a new proxy maintainer or no interest anymore. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Craig Edwards    2008-04-01 18:19:53 UTC  ``` I don't know who to ask about proxy maintaining of this - to be honest, maintaining packages is not my area of expertise.

# InspIRCd: Denial of service — GLSA **200805-08**

A buffer overflow in InspIRCd allows remote attackers to cause a Denial of
Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-irc/inspircd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.19** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.19** |

### Background

InspIRCd (Inspire IRCd) is a modular C++ IRC daemon.

### Description

The "namesx" and "uhnames" modules do not properly validate network
input, leading to a buffer overflow.

### Impact

A remote attacker can send specially crafted IRC commands to the
server, causing a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

Unload the "uhnames" module in the InspIRCd configuration.

### Resolution

All InspIRCd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-irc/inspircd-1.1.19"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
