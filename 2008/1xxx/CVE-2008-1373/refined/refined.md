{
  "CVE-2008-1373": {
    "Description": "The gif_read_lzw() function uses the code_size value from GIF images without properly checking it, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "Root cause": "Improper bounds checking in the gif_read_lzw() function when using code_size from GIF images.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attacker can send a crafted GIF file and possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running CUPS (usually lp), or cause a Denial of Service. The vulnerability is exploitable via the network when CUPS is sharing printers remotely.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted GIF files sent to the printing system"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local attacker could send specially crafted print jobs or a remote attacker, if printer sharing is enabled, could send a crafted GIF file to the printing system."
  }
