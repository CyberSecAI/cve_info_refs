Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-1414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `Mutiple Timesheets` application's improper handling of user-supplied input through the `tab` parameter. This lack of sanitization leads to multiple vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Directory Traversal (Path Traversal):**
    *   The application fails to properly sanitize the `tab` parameter in `index.php`, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem using `../` sequences.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The application does not sanitize the `tab` parameter in `index.php`, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code, which can then be executed in the user's browser.

3.  **Cookie Manipulation:**
    *   The application, specifically in `index.php`, `clientinfo.php`, `invoices.php`, `smartlinks.php`, and `todo.php`, allows manipulation of cookies via the `tab` parameter. An attacker can set arbitrary cookies by injecting `<meta http-equiv='Set-cookie' ...>` tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Directory Traversal:**
    *   An attacker can potentially read sensitive files on the server, including configuration files, password files, or application source code.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting:**
    *   An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript, potentially stealing user session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the application.

3.  **Cookie Manipulation:**
    *   An attacker can potentially set or modify cookies, which can lead to session hijacking, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities depending on the application logic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   All vulnerabilities are triggered through HTTP GET requests.
*   The `tab` parameter within the URL is the primary attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No special user privileges are required for exploitation.
*   The attacker must have network access to the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit examples show how to achieve each vulnerability.
*   The application version affected is `Mutiple Timesheets <= 5.0`.
*   The vulnerabilities are rated as "High" risk by the source.
*   The vulnerabilities are remote.

The exploit-db entry also refers to CVE-2008-1415, indicating that Multiple Timesheets had multiple vulnerabilities.
