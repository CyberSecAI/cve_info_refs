Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-1231:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Input validation issues in JSPWiki allow an attacker to include arbitrary local `.jsp` files. By manipulating the `editor` parameter in the `Edit.jsp` page, an attacker can traverse directories and include files, which leads to sensitive information disclosure and arbitrary code execution.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `editor` parameter is also vulnerable to XSS. An attacker can inject arbitrary script code into this parameter to be executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate user-supplied input, specifically the `editor` parameter.
*   **Path Traversal:** The lack of proper input validation allows for directory traversal, enabling the inclusion of files outside the intended directory.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Lack of output encoding or sanitization enables the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The LFI vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary server-side code by including malicious `.jsp` files. An attacker can upload a malicious `.jsp` file using disclosed path information and then execute it through the LFI.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The inclusion of sensitive files like `Install.jsp` and `admin/SecurityConfig.jsp` can expose sensitive information about the application, such as the full application path, storage locations, log files and application's security configurations.
*   **Session Hijacking/Account Compromise:** The XSS vulnerability can be used to steal cookies and potentially other sensitive information. This can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Server Compromise:** Arbitrary code execution can be used to compromise the server

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** Both vulnerabilities are exploited through crafted HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `editor` parameter in the `Edit.jsp` page.
*   **URL Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate the URL parameters to include malicious code or path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable JSPWiki application.
*   **No Authentication Required for LFI and XSS:** Neither exploit requires prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db entry lists CVE-2008-1231 alongside CVE-2008-1230 and CVE-2008-1229, indicating that multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in JSPWiki versions 2.4.104 and 2.5.139.
*   The exploit-db entry also provides specific examples of how to exploit the LFI and XSS vulnerabilities.
