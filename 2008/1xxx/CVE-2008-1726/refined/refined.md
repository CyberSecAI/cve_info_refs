Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `articletext.php`, `articletextonly.php` and `logincheck.php` files. Specifically, the `kqid` parameter in the first two scripts, and the `username` and `password` parameters in the latter are directly used in SQL queries without any validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary weakness is SQL injection vulnerability in `articletext.php` and `articletextonly.php` which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the `kqid` GET parameter.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  The vulnerability in `logincheck.php` allows an attacker to bypass authentication by injecting SQL code into the username field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (loginid and password).
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to administrative functions by bypassing the login process.
*   **Potential for Data Modification:** In addition to data exfiltration, SQL injection could potentially be used to modify or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The SQLi vulnerabilities in `articletext.php` and `articletextonly.php` are exploited via HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `kqid` parameter in the URL.
*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The authentication bypass vulnerability in `logincheck.php` is exploited via HTTP POST request by manipulating the `username` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application, which is likely a web server.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL injection payloads.
*   **No authentication required initially:**  The attack can be performed without prior authentication to the web application.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Snippets (articletext.php, articletextonly.php):**
    ```php
    $kqid = $HTTP_GET_VARS["kqid"];
    $result = mysql_query("select DATE_FORMAT(postdate,'%m-%d-%y') as  postdate, DATE_FORMAT(reveiwdate,'%m-%d-%y') as reveiwdate, categoryid,title,text, attach, kqid, authorid from knowledgebase where kqid=" .$kqid.mysql_error());
    ```
     ```php
     $kqid = $HTTP_GET_VARS["kqid"];
     $result = mysql_query("select * from knowledgebase where kqid=" .$kqid.mysql_error());
    ```

*   **Vulnerable Code Snippet (logincheck.php):**
    ```php
    $sql = "select * from login where loginid='". $username ."' and password='". $password . "'";
    ```
*   **Exploit Examples:**
    *   `http://www.site.com/[patch]/articletextonly.php?kqid=-9999/**/union/**/select/**/1,2,3,loginid,password,6,7,8,9,10,11/**/from/**/login/*`
    *   `http://www.site.com/[patch]/articletext.php?kqid=-999/**/union/**/select/**/1,2,3,loginid,password,6,7,8/**/from/**/login/*`
    *   Username: `admin ' or 1=1/*`
    *   Password: `[whatever]`
