Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1176 (The content also mentions CVE-2008-1177, but the focus here is on the requested CVE)

**Vulnerable Software:** Affiliate Market Ver. 0.1 BETA

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in `shop/detail.php`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS via the `sideblock4` parameter in `function/sideblock.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization or lack of parameterization of user-supplied input in SQL queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Insufficient sanitization or encoding of user input when reflected in web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials. The provided exploit demonstrates extraction of admin username and password.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker sends a crafted URL with malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter of `shop/detail.php`.
    * Example: `http://Target/shop/detail.php?id=/-1%27union/**/select/**/0,1,2,3,CoNcAt(0x4c6f67696e3a,user,0x3c656e64757365723e,0x0d0a50617373776f72643a,pass,0x3c656e64706173733e),5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,20/**/from/**/admin/*`
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attacker injects a malicious script in the `sideblock4` parameter of `function/sideblock.php`.
    * Example: `http://Target/function/sideblock.php?sideblock4=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   No authentication is needed to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes a Perl script that automates the SQL injection attack, demonstrating how to extract credentials.
* The script targets the admin table and extracts username and password.
*   The content also describes the XSS vulnerability and provides an example of an alert script.

**Summary**
The provided content details a web application (Affiliate Market Ver. 0.1 BETA) vulnerable to both SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting. The SQL injection vulnerability allows for extraction of sensitive data, such as administrative credentials, while the XSS vulnerability enables client-side attacks. The exploit script provided demonstrates an attack vector to extract admin credentials.
