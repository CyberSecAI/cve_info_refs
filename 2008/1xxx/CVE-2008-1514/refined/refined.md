## Analysis of CVE-2008-1514

The provided content relates to CVE-2008-1514.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A flaw in the ptrace interface of the Linux kernel on the s390 architecture allowed for writing into a padding area in the user_regs_struct32 structure while running in 31-bit mode.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of memory access within the ptrace functionality when dealing with user-space registers.
- The ability to access and modify a "padding area" within the user_regs_struct32 structure that should not be accessible or writable through the ptrace syscall.
- Lack of proper privilege checks in the ptrace implementation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unprivileged users could cause a kernel crash (denial of service) by exploiting this flaw. This could potentially lead to data loss and system unavailability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local exploitation via the ptrace interface. An attacker needs to use the ptrace system call to cause a kernel crash by writing to the padding area.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local unprivileged user access is required. No root access is necessary.
- The attacker needs to have the capability to execute code that makes use of the ptrace syscall.
- Specific to s390 architecture, when running in 31-bit mode.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is reproducible, and a test case is available.
- The issue was present in kernel versions such as 2.6.9-68.19.EL.s390 and 2.6.9-68.19.EL.s390x.
- A fix has been implemented upstream: `<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=3d6e48f43340343d97839eadb1ab7b6a3ea98797>`
- The vulnerability was fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux via RHSA-2008:0972 and RHSA-2008:0275
- Debian also addressed it in DSA-1653-1 and DSA-1655-1, noting it can cause denial of service
- openSUSE patched it via SUSE-SA:2008:051
