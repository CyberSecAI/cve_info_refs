Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1221

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The eScan Server (eserv.exe) FTP server, which listens on port 2021, fails to properly sanitize user-supplied filenames, allowing directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The FTP server attempts to block ".." patterns for directory traversal, but fails to prevent absolute path traversal using leading forward slashes "/" or backslashes "\".
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** Insufficient validation of file paths provided by users results in the ability to access files outside the intended root directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can download any file from the server's disk, including sensitive configuration files, application data, and system files.
- **Data Exposure:** Unauthorized access to critical system information can expose further attack vectors or lead to further compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by connecting to the FTP service on port 2021.
- **FTP Protocol:** The attack uses standard FTP commands to download arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the eScan server on port 2021.
- **FTP Client:** The attacker needs an FTP client to send the malicious file path.
- **No Authentication Required**: The provided information does not specify a requirement for authentication to perform the attack.

**Additional Details**

- **Affected Software:** MicroWorld eScan Server (aka eScan Management Console) versions up to and including 9.0.742.98.
- **Affected Platforms:** Windows.
- **Exploitation Method:** By prepending a forward slash "/" or backslash "\" to a file path in an FTP GET request, the server interprets this as the root directory, enabling access to any file on the disk.
- **Fix Status:** No fix was available at the time of reporting.
- **Specific examples** /boot.ini, \windows\win.ini are provided as ways to exploit this vulnerability
- **Upload is not possible**: Only downloading files is allowed by the vulnerable service.
