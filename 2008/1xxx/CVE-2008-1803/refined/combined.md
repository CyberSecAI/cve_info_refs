Package        : rdesktop
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1801 CVE-2008-1802 CVE-2008-1803
Debian Bug     : 480133 480134 480135

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in rdesktop, a
Remote Desktop Protocol client. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-1801

    Remote exploitation of an integer underflow vulnerability allows
    attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
    logged-in user.

CVE-2008-1802

    Remote exploitation of a BSS overflow vulnerability allows
    attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
    logged-in user.

CVE-2008-1803

    Remote exploitation of an integer signedness vulnerability allows
    attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
    logged-in user.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.0-1etch2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.0-4+cvs20071006.

We recommend that you upgrade your rdesktop package.

| [Description](#c0)  Bryan Stine (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-28 20:38:22 UTC  ``` I think that including the ReiserFS quota support option in the stock Gentoo kernel would be great. I use Reiser on all of my partitions and would love to be able to restrict my users' disk usage while reaping the benefits of the Gentoo patches. It'd be great if you could add this. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Joachim Blaabjerg (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-06-20 14:34:40 UTC  ``` Alright, I'm on it. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Joachim Blaabjerg (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-06-20 15:38:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1640](attachment.cgi?id=1640 "quota-patches.tar.bz2 - reiserfs quota patches for mjc-sources") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=1640&action=edit "quota-patches.tar.bz2 - reiserfs quota patches for mjc-sources")] quota-patches.tar.bz2 - reiserfs quota patches for mjc-sources  contents of quota-patches.tar.bz2: quota-patches/ quota-patches/63_reiserfs-quota-22 quota-patches/64_kinoded-8-2.4.19-pre3 quota-patches/62_nesting-10-2.4.19-pre3  It compiles, but I can't test it as I don't use Reiser nor quota. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Bryan Stine (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-06-21 21:13:17 UTC  ``` I'll try to get that tested on a vmware install or something asap. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Michael Cohen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-06-25 17:07:36 UTC  ``` soon as I hear about stability, I'll drop it in. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Bryan Stine (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-06-26 14:07:08 UTC  ``` Seems to work normally.

# rdesktop: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200806-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities in rdesktop may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/rdesktop** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.0** |

### Background

rdesktop is an open source Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client.

### Description

An anonymous researcher reported multiple vulnerabilities in rdesktop
via iDefense Labs:

* An integer underflow error exists in
  the function iso\_recv\_msg() in the file iso.c which can be triggered
  via a specially crafted RDP request, causing a heap-based buffer
  overflow (CVE-2008-1801).
* An input validation error exists in
  the function process\_redirect\_pdu() in the file rdp.c which can be
  triggered via a specially crafted RDP redirect request, causing a
  BSS-based buffer overflow (CVE-2008-1802).
* An integer signedness error exists in the function xrealloc() in the
  file rdesktop.c which can be be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer
  overflow (CVE-2008-1803).

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by enticing a user to
connect to a malicious RDP server thereby allowing the attacker to
execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All rdesktop users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/rdesktop-1.6.0"
```

# USN-646-1: rdesktop vulnerabilities

18 September 2008

rdesktop vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [rdesktop](/security/cves?package=rdesktop) -

## Details

It was discovered that rdesktop did not properly validate the length

of packet headers when processing RDP requests. If a user were tricked

into connecting to a malicious server, an attacker could cause a

denial of service or possible execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user. ([CVE-2008-1801](/security/CVE-2008-1801))

Multiple buffer overflows were discovered in rdesktop when processing

RDP redirect requests. If a user were tricked into connecting to a

malicious server, an attacker could cause a denial of service or

possible execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user.

([CVE-2008-1802](/security/CVE-2008-1802))

It was discovered that rdesktop performed a signed integer comparison

when reallocating dynamic buffers which could result in a heap-based

overflow. If a user were tricked into connecting to a malicious

server, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possible

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user.

([CVE-2008-1802](/security/CVE-2008-1802))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
