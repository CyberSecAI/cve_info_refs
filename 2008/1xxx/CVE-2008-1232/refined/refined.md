  "CVE-2008-1232": {
    "description": "The message argument of HttpServletResponse.sendError() call is not only displayed on the error page, but is also used for the reason-phrase of HTTP response. This may include characters that are illegal in HTTP headers. It is possible for a specially crafted message to result in arbitrary content being injected into the HTTP response. For a successful XSS attack, unfiltered user supplied data must be included in the message argument.",
    "vulnerability": "Cross-site scripting",
    "impact": "Arbitrary content injection into HTTP response, potentially leading to XSS if unfiltered user-supplied data is included in the message argument.",
    "attack_vector": "A specially crafted message passed to `HttpServletResponse.sendError()`.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control or influence the message argument to `HttpServletResponse.sendError()`, particularly the ability to inject unfiltered user-supplied data.",
       "root_cause": "Insufficient sanitization of the message argument within `HttpServletResponse.sendError()` leading to the inclusion of characters that are illegal in HTTP headers.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "Apache Tomcat 4.1.0-4.1.37",
      "Apache Tomcat 6.0.0-6.0.16",
      "Apache Tomcat 5.5.0-5.5.26"
