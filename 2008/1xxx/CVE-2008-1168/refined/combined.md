# Sarg: Remote execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200803-21**

Sarg is vulnerable to the execution of arbitrary code when processed with
untrusted input files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/sarg** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.5** |

### Background

Sarg (Squid Analysis Report Generator) is a tool that provides many
informations about the Squid web proxy server users activities: time,
sites, traffic, etc.

### Description

Sarg doesn't properly check its input for abnormal content when
processing Squid log files.

### Impact

A remote attacker using a vulnerable Squid as a proxy server or a
reverse-proxy server can inject arbitrary content into the "User-Agent"
HTTP client header, that will be processed by sarg, which will lead to
the execution of arbitrary code, or JavaScript injection, allowing
Cross-Site Scripting attacks and the theft of credentials.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All sarg users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/sarg-2.2.5"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:03:45 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached Numeric-20.3.ebuild.  This is an update for use with python-2.1  It can be tested by starting a python shell (need a PPM image viewer installed: tkinter will suffice) and >>>from NumTut import * >>>view(greece)  should see a pretty picture.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:05:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10](attachment.cgi?id=10 "Numeric-20.3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=10&action=edit "Numeric-20.3.ebuild")] Numeric-20.3.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:06:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 11](attachment.cgi?id=11 "Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=11&action=edit "Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff")] Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 21:17:27 UTC  ``` This ebuild gives a Access violtion when run through the sandbox.  --------------------------- ACCESS VIOLATION SUMMARY ---------------------------LOG FILE = "/tmp/sandbox-Numeric-20.3-15709.log"  unlink:    /usr/lib/python2.1/distutils/command/install_headers.pyc open_wr:   /usr/lib/python2.1/distutils/command/install_headers.pyc -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-05 03:51:53 UTC  ``` The sandbox violation seems to be python version related.  I don't get a violation building against python-2.2. I even doubted that sandbox was working so I added a 'echo "fail" > /home/tod/tmp/fail.test' to the ebuild install function, and it then generated a access violation (sandbox is nice!).    Bottom line.  The simple fix seems to be change the depends to >=python-2.2 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-10 07:34:59 UTC  ``` added dep on >=python 2.2   ``` |  |
