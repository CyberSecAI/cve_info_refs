Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from unescaped PHP `exec()` calls within the ZoneMinder application. Specifically, arguments passed to the `exec()` function are not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands through the arguments passed to the `exec()` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an authorized remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server. The code is executed with the privileges of the Apache httpd user.
- **System Compromise:** This can potentially lead to a full system compromise depending on the permissions of the httpd user.
- **Data Breach:** The attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data within the server's file system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network through crafted URLs.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the web interface of ZoneMinder.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authorization:** The attacker needs to have authorization to access the ZoneMinder installation. This includes the ability to start, stop, and control the system.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to identify the specific parameters that are passed to the unescaped `exec()` calls.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mark Cox while trying to remotely adjust his home heating system.
- The exploit is simple, involving inserting a semicolon and using a reverse shell in the crafted URL.
- The vulnerability is considered moderate severity due to the authorization requirement. However, the impact can be significant.
- A patch for the vulnerability was released in ZoneMinder version 1.23.3.
- CVSS v2 Base Score is 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)
