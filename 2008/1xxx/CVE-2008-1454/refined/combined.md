Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products.

**What are the uninstall issues that customers may experience after installing these security updates?**

Supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows 2003 systems will receive the DNS server update as well as the DNS client updates. The DNS server update and the DNS client updates share binaries and must be uninstalled in the reverse order that they were installed to avoid regressing the shared binaries to previous versions. [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 823836](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/823836) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they uninstall these security updates.

**What are the random socket connection issues that customers may experience when installing this security update?**

By default, the DNS updates offered by this security bulletin will take advantage of a large number of available sockets to offer greater entropy. However, if the user has defined port ranges in the registry, then the updates will respect the user-defined settings and will only allocate the defined sockets.

Socket ranges can be defined in the following registry location:

**HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters Reg key Name: SocketPoolSize**

**Note** The DNS service must be restarted to implement these changes.

**What does defining the socket pool range do?**

It may be necessary to define the range of sockets that DNS can choose from to avoid conflicting with other applications or services that need the same socket pool for their communications. See [MaxUserPort](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/regentry/58791.mspx?mfr=true) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 812873](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/812873) for more details about these registry key settings.

**What are the differences between operating systems when defining the socket pool ranges?**

The MaxUserPort registry Key has different meanings on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 than on Microsoft Windows Server 2000 and Windows Server 2003. [Microsoft knowledge Base Article 929851](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929851) details the change in behavior for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.

In Microsoft Windows Server 2000 and Windows Server 2003, setting the MaxUserPort defines the ending point of the dynamic port range. The range starts at 1024 and continues to the user-defined value in the MaxUserPort registry key setting. After installing the updates offered by this security bulletin, the default behavior on Microsoft Windows Server 2000 and Windows Server 2003 will be to allocate sockets randomly from the port range 49152 to 65535. If the MaxUserPort range has been defined, then ports will be allocated randomly from 1024 to the defined value in the MaxUserPort registry key setting. Visit [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 812873](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/812873) for more information on reserving port ranges on Microsoft Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003.

In Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, setting the MaxUserPort defines the starting point of the dynamic port range. By default, the range on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 is 49152 to 65535.

**Where are the file information details?**

The file information details can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 953230](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/953230).

#### FAQ for DNS Insufficient Socket Entropy Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1447

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A spoofing vulnerability exists in Windows DNS client and DNS server. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could insert arbitrary addresses into the DNS cache.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Windows DNS service in the Windows DNS client and DNS server does not provide enough entropy when performing DNS queries.

**What is the Domain Name System (DNS)?**

Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the industry-standard suite of protocols that comprise TCP/IP. DNS is implemented using two software components: the DNS server and the DNS client (or resolver). Both components are run as background service applications. Network resources are identified by numeric IP addresses, but these IP addresses are difficult for network users to remember. The DNS database contains records that map user-friendly alphanumeric names for network resources, such as [www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com), to the IP addresses used by those resources for communication. In this way, DNS acts as a mnemonic device, making network resources easier to remember for network users. For more information and to view logical diagrams illustrating how DNS fits with other Windows technologies, review the article [what is DNS](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/ff937311-03ce-4d04-b72c-b39c4d51cb36).

**What is DNS Cache?**

Domain Name System (DNS) caching resolver service is a service that saves the responses to DNS queries so that the DNS server is not repeatedly queried for the same information. For more information, see the [DNSCache](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/regentry/30643.mspx?mfr=true) Technet article or the [DNS Resolver Cache Service](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/cnet/cnbc_imp_qxht.mspx?mfr=true) Technet article.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2008 (all editions)
