- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `includes/dynamic_titles.php` file of PHP-Nuke Platinum 7.6.b.5, specifically in lines 44-427. The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The provided Perl script demonstrates the ability to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read arbitrary data from the database, potentially including sensitive user information like usernames and passwords. The exploit also mentions the possibility of file write access, suggesting that more severe attacks like remote code execution might be achievable depending on the server's configuration and database privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `modules.php` file, specifically by crafting a malicious URL that injects SQL code into the query executed by `dynamic_titles.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PHP-Nuke application. No authentication is required for this specific exploit to function. The attacker also needs to know/determine that magic_quotes_gpc is disabled on the target system.
