{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing the 'language' or 'lang' parameters, leading to a Local File Inclusion vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive files on the server's filesystem, potentially including configuration files, password files, or other sensitive data.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'language' or 'lang' parameters in the URL to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../), an attacker can access arbitrary files on the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and manipulate the URL parameters."
