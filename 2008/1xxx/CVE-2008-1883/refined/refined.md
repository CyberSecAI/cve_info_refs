{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The provided code leverages multiple vulnerabilities in the Blackboard Academic Suite to achieve a worm-like propagation and information theft.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The code injects malicious JavaScript into the application via crafted URLs, which allows for non-persistent and persistent XSS attacks.",
       "Insecure Direct Object Reference: The script directly accesses and modifies user profiles and course information using predictable URLs without proper authorization checks, enabling unauthorized data access and modification.",
       "Lack of input sanitization: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data, allowing the attacker to inject malicious script.",
       "Insufficient Access Controls: The application does not properly validate the authorization of a user to perform certain actions, which is why the attacker can alter data without having the required permissions."
    ],
    "impact": "The attacker can steal user credentials, modify user profiles (like changing the user's email), spread the malicious code to other users via email and announcements, and potentially gain control over the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "XSS via crafted URLs in emails and announcements.",
      "Direct manipulation of user profiles via HTTP POST requests.",
      "Emailing malicious URLs to users of the system."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a user of the Blackboard system, with the ability to post content such as email messages and announcements. No other special capabilities are needed beyond having an account on the system.",
    "additional_details": "The provided scripts contain the logic for both stealing user information and propagating the attack to other users via email and announcements. It also logs the user data to an external server. The script uses AJAX requests to interact with the Blackboard application."
