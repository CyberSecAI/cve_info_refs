    {
      "source": "www.gnucitizen.org_080fc02a_20250125_072154.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a combination of design problems in UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) and the ability of Flash to send arbitrary SOAP messages to a router's UPnP control point without proper authorization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of authentication and authorization for UPnP control point access.",
        "Ability of Flash to make HTTP POST requests with custom content-type and headers to internal IPs",
        "Vague UPnP specifications regarding the `NewInternalClient` value allowing external IP addresses."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can remotely reconfigure vulnerable routers, add port forwarding rules, change DNS servers, reset admin credentials, and create onion routing networks, potentially taking over the router and the network it controls.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a malicious SWF (Flash) file hosted on a website. When the victim visits the website and the Flash content executes it silently sends SOAP messages to the router's UPnP control point.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create and host a malicious SWF file and convince the victim to visit the webpage. Additionally, the attacker needs to know or guess the internal IP address of the victim's router."

      "source": "www.kb.cert.org_5c20d0cf_20250125_072155.html",
      "root_cause": "Multiple vendors ship devices with UPnP enabled by default, which can allow remote configuration without authentication. This is combined with the ability of browser plugins (such as Flash) to send UPnP messages to local devices.",

        "UPnP enabled by default on many devices.",
        "Lack of authentication in UPnP for remote configuration",

       "Incorrect handling of unexpected header values in routers"

      "attack_vectors": "Convincing a user to click on a malicious link in a web page or HTML email. The attacker sends UPnP messages using browser plugins like Flash to local devices without authentication.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit a malicious webpage. The attacker may also need to guess the IP address of the targeted UPnP device but this could be enumerated using browser headers or other methods."

      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious SWF file that silently executes in the background when the victim visits a website containing it, sending SOAP messages to the router.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious SWF file and convince the user to visit the webpage. This could be achieved through spearphishing campaigns or by using a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.  The IP address of the router also needs to be known, which may be obtained by guessing."
