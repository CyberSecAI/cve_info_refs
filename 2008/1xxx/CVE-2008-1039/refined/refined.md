Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1039:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `question.asp` page of PORAR WebBoard. This occurs due to insufficient sanitization or validation of the `QID` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
*  **Weakness/Vulnerability:** SQL injection. The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `QID` parameter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability allows an attacker to:
    *   Extract sensitive information directly from the database.
    *   Specifically, the provided exploit code aims to retrieve admin usernames and passwords from the `administrator` table.
    *   Potentially modify or delete data within the database (although not explicitly stated in the exploit code).
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the administrative interface.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable `question.asp` page.
    *   The attacker manipulates the `QID` parameter in the URL.
    *   Specifically, the attacker injects SQL code using the `union select` operator to extract the desired information.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting PORAR WebBoard.
    *   No specific authentication or prior access is necessary to exploit this vulnerability, as it is present in a publicly accessible page.

**Technical Details**

The exploit examples provided show how to inject SQL code via the `QID` parameter. By using `union select` statement, the attacker can bypass the intended query and extract data.

Example:
```
question.asp?QID=-1122334455%20+%20union%20+%20select%20+%200,null,2,username,password,5,password,7,8,9,null%20+%20from%20+%20+%20administrator%20';';
```

This particular exploit is designed to pull the "username" and "password" from the "administrator" table. The examples also illustrate that the number of columns in the `select` statement might need to vary based on the specific database structure.

**Additional Information:**

*   The Exploit-DB entry provides clear examples of the exploit, including the specific SQL injection payload.
*   It also identifies the vulnerable application as "PORAR WEBBOARD" and the platform as "ASP."
* The exploit was published on 2008-02-25.

This information provides a good understanding of the nature of the SQL injection vulnerability and how it could be exploited in PORAR WebBoard.
