  "CVE-2008-1167": {
    "description": "The SQUID logfile analyzer sarg was updated to fix a buffer overflow that can occur while handling untrusted log data. (CVE-2008-1167)",
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in sarg when processing Squid log files, due to improper input validation of untrusted data.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can inject arbitrary content into the \"User-Agent\" HTTP client header. This can lead to execution of arbitrary code, JavaScript injection, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially allowing for theft of credentials.",
      "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker using a vulnerable Squid as a proxy or reverse-proxy can inject malicious content into the 'User-Agent' HTTP header, which will be processed by sarg, thus triggering the overflow."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests through a vulnerable Squid proxy server.",
    "affected_packages": "net-analyzer/sarg versions before 2.2.5"
  }
