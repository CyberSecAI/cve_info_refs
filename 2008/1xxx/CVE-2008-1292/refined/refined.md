Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1292:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in ViewVC's failure to properly check access permissions when providing revision metadata. Specifically, the software doesn't consistently verify if the user is authorized to view the requested content before revealing it through various features.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Inadequate access control:** ViewVC lacks proper access control checks when presenting revision metadata.
- **Information exposure:** Sensitive information is exposed due to insufficient validation of user permissions, which allows access to restricted content.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information disclosure:** Unauthorized users can gain access to sensitive information by reading forbidden pathnames, log history, or diff view parameters.
- **Bypassing access restrictions:** Attackers can bypass intended restrictions and obtain data they are not meant to access.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Direct URL manipulation:** Attackers can craft URLs to directly access hidden CVSROOT folders and forbidden files.
- **Revision view exploitation:** Attackers can view restricted content through the revision view.
- **Log history manipulation:** Attackers can view log history that should be inaccessible to them through traversal of forbidden objects.
- **Diff view path manipulation:** Attackers can obtain forbidden information through manipulating path parameters in diff view.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Remote access:** The attacker can be remote, requiring no local presence on the target machine.
- **Knowledge of ViewVC:** The attacker must have some knowledge of how ViewVC works and how to exploit the vulnerable areas.
- **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the ViewVC instance.

**Additional details:**

- Multiple CVEs were addressed in the fix. This CVE is part of a series that includes CVE-2008-1290 and CVE-2008-1291, all related to access control issues in ViewVC.
- The fix was implemented in ViewVC version 1.0.5, addressing all the mentioned vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- The Debian bug report #471380 shows the patch was included to fix the issue in version 1.0.5-0.1
