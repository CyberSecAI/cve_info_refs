How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

                 CVE-2008-1241

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceape internet
suite, an unbranded version of the Seamonkey Internet Suite. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-4879

    Peter Brodersen and Alexander Klink discovered that the
    autoselection of SSL client certificates could lead to users
    being tracked, resulting in a loss of privacy.

CVE-2008-1233

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that variants of CVE-2007-3738 and
    CVE-2007-5338 allow the execution of arbitrary code through
    XPCNativeWrapper.

CVE-2008-1234

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that insecure handling of event
    handlers could lead to cross-site scripting.

CVE-2008-1235

    Boris Zbarsky, Johnny Stenback, and "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered
    that incorrect principal handling can lead to cross-site
    scripting and the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1236

    Tom Ferris, Seth Spitzer, Martin Wargers, John Daggett and Mats
    Palmgren discovered crashes in the layout engine, which might
    allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1237

    "georgi", "tgirmann" and Igor Bukanov discovered crashes in the
    Javascript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary
    code.

CVE-2008-1238

    Gregory Fleischer discovered that HTTP Referrer headers were
    handled incorrectly in combination with URLs containing Basic
    Authentication credentials with empty usernames, resulting
    in potential Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

CVE-2008-1240

    Gregory Fleischer discovered that web content fetched through
    the jar: protocol can use Java to connect to arbitrary ports.
    This is only an issue in combination with the non-free Java
    plugin.

CVE-2008-1241

    Chris Thomas discovered that background tabs could generate
    XUL popups overlaying the current tab, resulting in potential
    spoofing attacks.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.13~pre080323b-0etch1.

The Mozilla products of the old stable distribution (sarge) are no
longer supported.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird
an open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The
SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver production-quality
releases of code derived from the application formerly known as the
'Mozilla Application Suite'. XULRunner is a Mozilla runtime package
that can be used to bootstrap XUL+XPCOM applications like Firefox and
Thunderbird.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were reported in all mentioned Mozilla
products:

* Jesse Ruderman, Kai Engert, Martijn Wargers, Mats Palmgren, and Paul
  Nickerson reported browser crashes related to JavaScript methods,
  possibly triggering memory corruption (CVE-2008-0412).
* Carsten Book, Wesley Garland, Igor Bukanov, moz\_bug\_r\_a4, shutdown,
  Philip Taylor, and tgirmann reported crashes in the JavaScript engine,
  possibly triggering memory corruption (CVE-2008-0413).
* David Bloom discovered a vulnerability in the way images are treated by
  the browser when a user leaves a page, possibly triggering memory
  corruption (CVE-2008-0419).
* moz\_bug\_r\_a4, Boris Zbarsky, and Johnny Stenback reported a series of
  privilege escalation vulnerabilities related to JavaScript
  (CVE-2008-1233, CVE-2008-1234, CVE-2008-1235).
* Mozilla developers identified browser crashes caused by the layout and
  JavaScript engines, possibly triggering memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-1236, CVE-2008-1237).
* moz\_bug\_r\_a4 and Boris Zbarsky discovered that pages could escape from
  its sandboxed context and run with chrome privileges, and inject script
  content into another site, violating the browser's same origin policy
  (CVE-2008-0415).
* Gerry Eisenhaur discovered a directory traversal vulnerability when
  using "flat" addons (CVE-2008-0418).
* Alexey Proskuryakov, Yosuke Hasegawa and Simon Montagu reported
  multiple character handling flaws related to the backspace character,
  the "0x80" character, involving zero-length non-ASCII sequences in
  multiple character sets, that could facilitate Cross-Site Scripting
  attacks (CVE-2008-0416).

The following vulnerability was reported in Thunderbird and SeaMonkey:

* regenrecht (via iDefense) reported a heap-based buffer overflow when
  rendering an email message with an external MIME body (CVE-2008-0304).

The following vulnerabilities were reported in Firefox, SeaMonkey and
XULRunner:

* The fix for CVE-2008-1237 in Firefox 2.0.0.13
  and SeaMonkey 1.1.9 introduced a new crash vulnerability
  (CVE-2008-1380).
* hong and Gregory Fleischer each reported a
  variant on earlier reported bugs regarding focus shifting in file input
  controls (CVE-2008-0414).
* Gynvael Coldwind (Vexillium) discovered that BMP images could be used
  to reveal uninitialized memory, and that this data could be extracted
  using a "canvas" feature (CVE-2008-0420).
* Chris Thomas reported that background tabs could create a borderless
  XUL pop-up in front of pages in other tabs (CVE-2008-1241).
* oo.rio.oo discovered that a plain text file with a
  "Content-Disposition: attachment" prevents Firefox from rendering
  future plain text files within the browser (CVE-2008-0592).
* Martin Straka reported that the ".href" property of stylesheet DOM
  nodes is modified to the final URI of a 302 redirect, bypassing the
  same origin policy (CVE-2008-0593).
* Gregory Fleischer discovered that under certain circumstances, leading
  characters from the hostname part of the "Referer:" HTTP header are
  removed (CVE-2008-1238).
* Peter Brodersen and Alexander Klink reported that the browser
  automatically selected and sent a client certificate when SSL Client
  Authentication is requested by a server (CVE-2007-4879).
* Gregory Fleischer reported that web content fetched via the "jar:"
  protocol was not subject to network access restrictions
  (CVE-2008-1240).

The following vulnerabilities were reported in Firefox:

* Justin Dolske discovered a CRLF injection vulnerability when storing
  passwords (CVE-2008-0417).
* Michal Zalewski discovered that Firefox does not properly manage a
  delay timer used in confirmation dialogs (CVE-2008-0591).
* Emil Ljungdahl and Lars-Olof Moilanen discovered that a web forgery
  warning dialog is not displayed if the entire contents of a web page
  are in a DIV tag that uses absolute positioning (CVE-2008-0594).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly
leading to the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service. It
is also possible for an attacker to trick a user to upload arbitrary
files when submitting a form, to corrupt saved passwords for other
sites, to steal login credentials, or to conduct Cross-Site Scripting
and Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.14"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-2.0.0.14"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-2.0.0.14"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-2.0.0.14"
```

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.1.9-r1"
```

All SeaMonkey binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-bin-1.1.9"
```

All XULRunner users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/xulrunner-1.8.1.14"
```

NOTE: The crash vulnerability (CVE-2008-1380) is currently unfixed in
the SeaMonkey binary ebuild, as no precompiled packages have been
released. Until an update is available, we recommend all SeaMonkey
users to disable JavaScript, use Firefox for JavaScript-enabled
browsing, or switch to the SeaMonkey source ebuild.

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceweasel
web browser, an unbranded version of the Firefox browser. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2007-4879

    Peter Brodersen and Alexander Klink discovered that the
    autoselection of SSL client certificates could lead to users
    being tracked, resulting in a loss of privacy.

CVE-2008-1233

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that variants of CVE-2007-3738 and
    CVE-2007-5338 allow the execution of arbitrary code through
    XPCNativeWrapper.

CVE-2008-1234

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that insecure handling of event
    handlers could lead to cross-site scripting.

CVE-2008-1235

    Boris Zbarsky, Johnny Stenback, and "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered
    that incorrect principal handling can lead to cross-site
    scripting and the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1236

    Tom Ferris, Seth Spitzer, Martin Wargers, John Daggett and Mats
    Palmgren discovered crashes in the layout engine, which might
    allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1237

    "georgi", "tgirmann" and Igor Bukanov discovered crashes in the
    Javascript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary
    code.

CVE-2008-1238

    Gregory Fleischer discovered that HTTP Referrer headers were
    handled incorrectly in combination with URLs containing Basic
    Authentication credentials with empty usernames, resulting
    in potential Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

CVE-2008-1240

    Gregory Fleischer discovered that web content fetched through
    the jar: protocol can use Java to connect to arbitrary ports.
    This is only an issue in combination with the non-free Java
    plugin.

CVE-2008-1241

    Chris Thomas discovered that background tabs could generate
    XUL popups overlaying the current tab, resulting in potential
    spoofing attacks.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.13-0etch1.

The Mozilla products from the old stable distribution (sarge) are no
longer supported.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- rsync heap overflow in xattr code
A remotely exploitable heap overflow in rsync's xattr code has
been fixed. CVE-2008-1720 has been assigned to this issue.
rsync was fixed on openSUSE 10.3.
- MozillaFirefox 2.0.0.14 security release
Mozilla Firefox was brought to security update version 2.0.0.14.
Following security problems were fixed:
- MFSA 2008-20/CVE-2008-1380: Fixes for security problems in the
JavaScript engine described in MFSA 2008-15 (CVE-2008-1237) introduced
a stability problem, where some users experienced frequent crashes
during JavaScript garbage collection. These crashes may be exploitable
if someone finds a reliable way to trigger the crash.
We were not able to reproduce the crashes internally. Updates have been
released on SLE 10, SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- poppler PDF problems
Specially crafted PDF files with embedded fonts could potentially be
abused to trick applications that process PDF files into executing
arbitrary code (CVE-2008-1693).
Fixes for poppler for all distributions containing poppler have
been released.
- nagios cross site scripting problems
Several cross site scripting (XSS) issues in nagios were fixed
(CVE-2007-5624, CVE-2007-5803, CVE-2008-1360).
SLE 10, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 received fixed nagios packages.
- lighttpd SSL denial of service
The web server lighttpd had a problem, where an error in one
SSL connection could lead to termination of all SSL connections
(CVE-2008-1531)
This problem has been fixed in SLE 10, SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE
10.2 and 10.3.
- sarg various buffer overflows
Multiple stack buffer overflows have been fixed in the Squid logfile
analyzer sarg. (CVE-2008-1922)
sarg updates have been released for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2
and 10.3.
- squid denial of service fix
A flaw in a previous security update could cause squid to crash
under certain circumstances (CVE-2008-1612).
squid was updated on all distributions.
- bzip2 decoder denial of service
Specially crafted files could crash the bzip2-decoder
(CVE-2008-1372).
bzip2 was updated on all distributions.
- kdelibs3 unix signal handling
Start\_kdeinit did not handle unix signals the right way
(CVE-2008-1671)
This was only a problem in openSUSE 10.3 and fixed there.
- texlive-bin dvips overflows
Buffer overflows in dvips and dviljk could be triggered by specially
crafted dvi files (CVE-2007-5935, CVE-2007-5937). dvips additionally
created temporary files in an insecure manner (CVE-2007-5936).
Only openSUSE 10.3 updates were missing for this issue, the others
were released several weeks ago already.
- kdelibs4 heap overflow in PNG loader of KHTML
A heap overflow in the PNG loader of KHTML has been
fixed. CVE-2008-1670 has been assigned to this issue.
Only openSUSE 10.3 was affected and fixed.
- Sun Java 1.6.0 u6 security update
Sun Java was updated to 1.6.0u6 to fix several bugs and potentially
also security problems.
Sun has however not published any details regarding Security
Vulnerabilities in this update.
Only openSUSE 10.3 contains Sun Java 1.6.0 and was fixed.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## Details

Alexey Proskuryakov, Yosuke Hasegawa and Simon Montagu discovered flaws

in Firefox's character encoding handling. If a user were tricked into

opening a malicious web page, an attacker could perform cross-site

scripting attacks. ([CVE-2008-0416](/security/CVE-2008-0416))

Various flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine. By tricking

a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could escalate

privileges within the browser, perform cross-site scripting attacks

and/or execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.

([CVE-2008-1233](/security/CVE-2008-1233), [CVE-2008-1234](/security/CVE-2008-1234), [CVE-2008-1235](/security/CVE-2008-1235))

Several problems were discovered in Firefox which could lead to crashes

and memory corruption. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious

web page, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the

user's privileges. ([CVE-2008-1236](/security/CVE-2008-1236), [CVE-2008-1237](/security/CVE-2008-1237))

Gregory Fleischer discovered Firefox did not properly process HTTP

Referrer headers when they were sent with with requests to URLs

containing Basic Authentication credentials with empty usernames. An

attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform cross-site request

forgery attacks. ([CVE-2008-1238](/security/CVE-2008-1238))

Peter Brodersen and Alexander Klink reported that default the setting in

Firefox for SSL Client Authentication allowed for users to be tracked

via their client certificate. The default has been changed to prompt

the user each time a website requests a client certificate.

([CVE-2007-4879](/security/CVE-2007-4879))

Gregory Fleischer discovered that web content fetched via the jar

protocol could use Java LiveConnect to connect to arbitrary ports on

the user's machine due to improper parsing in the Java plugin. If a

user were tricked into opening malicious web content, an attacker may be

able to access services running on the user's machine. ([CVE-2008-1195](/security/CVE-2008-1195),

[CVE-2008-1240](/security/CVE-2008-1240))

Chris Thomas discovered that Firefox would allow an XUL popup from an

unselected tab to display in front of the selected tab. An attacker

could exploit this behavior to spoof a login prompt and steal the user's

credentials. ([CVE-2008-1241](/security/CVE-2008-1241))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Icedove mail
client, an unbranded version of the Thunderbird client. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-1233

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that variants of CVE-2007-3738 and
    CVE-2007-5338 allow the execution of arbitrary code through
    XPCNativeWrapper.

CVE-2008-1234

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that insecure handling of event
    handlers could lead to cross-site scripting.

CVE-2008-1235

    Boris Zbarsky, Johnny Stenback, and "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered
    that incorrect principal handling can lead to cross-site
    scripting and the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1236

    Tom Ferris, Seth Spitzer, Martin Wargers, John Daggett and Mats
    Palmgren discovered crashes in the layout engine, which might
    allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1237

    "georgi", "tgirmann" and Igor Bukanov discovered crashes in the
    Javascript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary
    code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=438724#c0)  Josh Bressers    2008-03-24 18:53:38 UTC  ``` Security researcher Gregory Fleischer demonstrated a problem with the HTTP Referrer headers sent with requests to URLs containing Basic Authentication credentials with empty usernames. In these cases a number of leading characters, based on the length of the password in the URL, are removed from the referrer header's hostname.  This could possibly lead to a CSRF attack.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=438724#c1)  Josh Bressers    2008-03-24 18:54:21 UTC  ``` This will be mfsa2008-16   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=438724#c3)  Josh Bressers    2008-03-26 01:58:13 UTC  ``` This is now public: <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2008/mfsa2008-16.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=438724#c4)  Fedora Update System    2008-03-26 02:15:08 UTC  ``` blam-1.8.3-14.fc8,chmsee-1.0.0-1.30.fc8,devhelp-0.16.1-6.fc8,epiphany-2.20.3-2.fc8,epiphany-extensions-2.20.1-6.fc8,firefox-2.0.0.13-1.fc8,galeon-2.0.4-1.fc8.3,gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-13.fc8,gnome-web-photo-0.3-9.fc8,gtkmozembedmm-1.4.2.cvs20060817-19.fc8,kazehakase-0.5.3-5.fc8,liferea-1.4.13-2.fc8,Miro-1.1.2-2.fc8,openvrml-0.17.5-4.fc8,ruby-gnome2-0.16.0-21.fc8,yelp-2.20.0-8.fc8 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 8   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=438724#c5)  Fedora Update System    2008-03-26 17:09:55 UTC  ``` chmsee-1.0.0-1.30.fc7, devhelp-0.13-15.fc7, epiphany-2.18.3-8.fc7, epiphany-extensions-2.18.3-8, firefox-2.0.0.13-1.fc7, galeon-2.0.3-16.fc7, gnome-python2-extras-2.14.3-9.fc7, gtkmozembedmm-1.4.2.cvs20060817-16.fc7, kazehakase-0.5.3-5.fc7, liferea-1.4.13-2.fc7, Miro-1.1.2-2.fc7, openvrml-0.16.7-4.fc7, ruby-gnome2-0.16.0-22.fc7, yelp-2.18.1-10.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.

                 CVE-2008-1236 CVE-2008-1237 CVE-2008-1238 CVE-2008-1240
                 CVE-2008-1241

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-4879

    Peter Brodersen and Alexander Klink discovered that the
    autoselection of SSL client certificates could lead to users
    being tracked, resulting in a loss of privacy.

CVE-2008-1233

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that variants of CVE-2007-3738 and
    CVE-2007-5338 allow the execution of arbitrary code through
    XPCNativeWrapper.

CVE-2008-1234

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that insecure handling of event
    handlers could lead to cross-site scripting.

CVE-2008-1235

    Boris Zbarsky, Johnny Stenback, and "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered
    that incorrect principal handling could lead to cross-site
    scripting and the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1236

    Tom Ferris, Seth Spitzer, Martin Wargers, John Daggett and Mats
    Palmgren discovered crashes in the layout engine, which might
    allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1237

    "georgi", "tgirmann" and Igor Bukanov discovered crashes in the
    Javascript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary
    code.

CVE-2008-1238

    Gregory Fleischer discovered that HTTP Referrer headers were
    handled incorrectly in combination with URLs containing Basic
    Authentication credentials with empty usernames, resulting
    in potential Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

CVE-2008-1240

    Gregory Fleischer discovered that web content fetched through
    the jar: protocol can use Java to connect to arbitrary ports.
    This is only an issue in combination with the non-free Java
    plugin.

CVE-2008-1241

    Chris Thomas discovered that background tabs could generate
    XUL popups overlaying the current tab, resulting in potential
    spoofing attacks.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.0.15~pre080323b-0etch1.

The Mozilla products from the old stable distribution (sarge) are
no longer supported.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.1.13-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the processing of some malformed web content. A
web page containing such malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash
or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.
(CVE-2008-1233, CVE-2008-1235, CVE-2008-1236, CVE-2008-1237)

Several flaws were found in the display of malformed web content. A web
page containing specially-crafted content could, potentially, trick a
SeaMonkey user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-1234,
CVE-2008-1238, CVE-2008-1241)

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to resolve these issues.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2008-15

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.8.1.13)

Announced
March 25, 2008
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.13
* SeaMonkey 1.1.9
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.14

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the
browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of
these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these
could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and could
be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not the
default setting and we strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in
mail. Without further investigation we cannot rule out the possibility that
for some of these an attacker might be able to prepare memory for exploitation
through some means other than JavaScript such as large images.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be installed.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)

## Details

Various flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine. If a user had

JavaScript enabled and were tricked into opening a malicious email,

an attacker could escalate privileges within Thunderbird, perform

cross-site scripting attacks and/or execute arbitrary code with the

user's privileges. ([CVE-2008-1233](/security/CVE-2008-1233), [CVE-2008-1234](/security/CVE-2008-1234), [CVE-2008-1235](/security/CVE-2008-1235))

Several problems were discovered in Thunderbird which could lead to

crashes and memory corruption. If a user had JavaScript enabled and

were tricked into opening a malicious email, an attacker may be able

to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2008-1236](/security/CVE-2008-1236),

[CVE-2008-1237](/security/CVE-2008-1237))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=438718#c0)  Josh Bressers    2008-03-24 18:19:40 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in versions of Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=438718#c1)  Josh Bressers    2008-03-24 18:25:00 UTC  ``` This is going to be part of mfsa2008-15   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=438718#c3)  Josh Bressers    2008-03-26 02:01:26 UTC  ``` This is now public: <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2008/mfsa2008-15.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=438718#c4)  Fedora Update System    2008-03-26 02:15:04 UTC  ``` blam-1.8.3-14.fc8,chmsee-1.0.0-1.30.fc8,devhelp-0.16.1-6.fc8,epiphany-2.20.3-2.fc8,epiphany-extensions-2.20.1-6.fc8,firefox-2.0.0.13-1.fc8,galeon-2.0.4-1.fc8.3,gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-13.fc8,gnome-web-photo-0.3-9.fc8,gtkmozembedmm-1.4.2.cvs20060817-19.fc8,kazehakase-0.5.3-5.fc8,liferea-1.4.13-2.fc8,Miro-1.1.2-2.fc8,openvrml-0.17.5-4.fc8,ruby-gnome2-0.16.0-21.fc8,yelp-2.20.0-8.fc8 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 8   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=438718#c5)  Fedora Update System    2008-03-26 17:09:53 UTC  ``` chmsee-1.0.0-1.30.fc7, devhelp-0.13-15.fc7, epiphany-2.18.3-8.fc7, epiphany-extensions-2.18.3-8, firefox-2.0.0.13-1.fc7, galeon-2.0.3-16.fc7, gnome-python2-extras-2.14.3-9.fc7, gtkmozembedmm-1.4.2.cvs20060817-16.fc7, kazehakase-0.5.3-5.fc7, liferea-1.4.13-2.fc7, Miro-1.1.2-2.fc7, openvrml-0.16.7-4.fc7, ruby-gnome2-0.16.0-22.fc7, yelp-2.18.1-10.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.
