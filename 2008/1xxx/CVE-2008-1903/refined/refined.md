{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application's `news_show.php` script directly includes files based on the `newsoffice_directory` parameter without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The application is vulnerable to remote file inclusion because it directly includes the files specified by the `newsoffice_directory` parameter without sanitizing or validating the input. This allows an attacker to include remote files on the server.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file containing PHP code.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to `news_show.php` with a malicious URL in the `newsoffice_directory` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, and host a malicious PHP file on a server reachable by the vulnerable application."
