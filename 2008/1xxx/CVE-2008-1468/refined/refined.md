{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Namazu search system does not properly sanitize user-provided input when outputting search results. Specifically, when no character code is specified, the system is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the improper handling of UTF-7 encoded strings.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability",
      "Improper sanitization of user input",
      "Lack of character code specification in output"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the search results page, which will then be executed in the user's browser when they view the results. This can allow attackers to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's browser session.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By crafting malicious search queries containing UTF-7 encoded scripts",
       "By injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code through the 'lang' or 'result' CGI parameter with relative directory representation, leading to directory traversal"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted search query or CGI parameters to the vulnerable Namazu instance. No authentication is required."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "Namazu 2.0.17 and earlier",
    "Namazu 2.0.20 or older (for IE 6,7)",
    "Namazu version 2.0.19 and older (buffer overrun)",
    "Namazu 2.0.15 or older (directory traversal)",
    "Namazu 2.0.13 or older (cross-site scripting)",
     "Namazu 1.3.0.10 or older (arbitrary file creation)",
      "Namazu 1.2 or older (multiple issues)"
  ],
  "remediation": [
    "Upgrade to the latest version of Namazu.",
     "For versions prior to 2.0.18, ensure that the ContentType in .namazurc includes a charset definition to avoid browser misidentification of UTF-7 encoded strings.",
     "Implement input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data, especially search queries.",
     "Ensure that the web server environment does not treat standard error output as standard output, or move namazu.cgi and .namazurc to locations inaccessible via HTTP and use a wrapper script to sanitize the QUERY_STRING.",
     "Configure the server with resource limits, especially when regular expressions are used in search operations."
