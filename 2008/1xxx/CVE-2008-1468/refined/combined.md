How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- powerdns spoofing problems
The PowerDNS packages were updated to offer better spoofing
resistance by not ignoring invalid queries. (CVE-2008-3337)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- dnsmasq spoofing problems
The DNS server dnsmasq was changed to use random UDP source ports
and a random TRXID now. (CVE-2008-1447)
This problem only affected openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- python multiple problems
The scripting language python was updated to fix several security
vulnerabilities. (CVE-2008-1679,CVE-2008-1887, CVE-2008-3143,
CVE-2008-3142, CVE-2008-3144, CVE-2008-2315, CVE-2008-2316)
All SUSE Linux products received updated python packages.
- mailman cross site scripting
The mailing list manager mailman was updated to fix a
cross-site-scripting bug (CVE-2008-0564) and a mistake in
translation.
All distributions containing mailman received updated packages.
- ruby multiple problems
The scripting language ruby was updated to fix:
- a possible information leakage (CVE-2008-1145)
- a directory traversal bug (CVE-2008-1891) in WEBrick
- various memory corruptions and integer overflows in array and
string handling (CVE-2008-2662, CVE-2008-2663, CVE-2008-2664,
CVE-2008-2725, CVE-2008-2726, CVE-2008-2727, CVE-2008-2728)
ruby was updated on all SUSE Linux products.
- Opera 9.52
Opera was upgraded to version 9.52 to fix possible security
vulnerabilities.
Please see <http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/952/> for
more details.
- neon NULL pointer problem
The helper library neon was updated to fix a NULL pointer dereference
in the digest authentication code. (CVE-2008-3746)
neon was updated on all affected distributions.
- rxvt-unicode session hijacking
Using rxvt-unicode it was possible to open a terminal on :0 when
the environment variable was not set.
This could be exploited by local users to hijack X11 connections (CVE-2008-1142).
rxvt-unicode was updated on openSUSE 10.2-11.0.
- perl multiple problems
Several problems were fixed in the scripting language perl.
Specially crafted regular expressions could crash perl
(CVE-2008-1927).
Insufficient symlink checks in the File::Path could result in wrong
file permissions (CVE-2008-2827).
Additionally problem in the CGI module was fixed that could result
in an endless loop if uploads were canceled.
- Wireshark / ethereal multiple security problems
Various vulnerabilities have been fixed in ethereal and wireshark:

CVE-2008-3140, CVE-2008-3141, CVE-2008-3145
and CVE-2008-3146. Those could be potentially used to crash
wireshark or potentially execute code.
Updates have been released for all SUSE Linux distributions.
- namazu cross site scripting
The indexing engine namazu was upgraded to fix a UTF-7
cross-site-scripting vulnerability. (CVE-2008-1468)
namazu was updated on all products containing it.
- gnome-screensaver clipboard disclosure
gnome-screensaver was updated to disallows local users to
read the contents of the clipboard for a locked screen using
ctrl-v. (CVE-2007-6389)
Updates have been released for openSUSE 10.3, other distributions
were not affected.
- MySQL security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix a security problem:
CVE-2008-2079: MySQL allowed local users to bypass certain privilege
checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1)
DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within
the MySQL home data directory, which can point to tables that are
created in the future.
CVE-2006-7232: sql\_select.cc in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.32 and 5.1.x
before 5.1.14 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA
table, as originally demonstrated using ORDER BY.
MySQL was updated on all SUSE Linux distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.

# Namazu: Security Considerations

---

## Fundamental policy

It should be safe the latest version of Namazu is, however
we can't make a promise about it. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR NAMAZU.
You are responsible yourself for using the software.
But we try our best to fix security issue. If you find any problem,
please contact to security@namazu.org.

## Known problems

* There is cross-site scripting vulnerability for IE 6,7
  in version 2.0.20 or older.
* To 2.0.19 or a version that is older than 2.0.19,
  there is a vulnerability of overrunning in the buffer.
  It recommends since Namazu 2.0.20 to be used.
* To 2.0.17 or a version that is older than 2.0.17
  There is a weakness of retrieval type
  by the misidentification of the encode
  automatic operation recognition of Web browser
  that is the UTF-7 encoding. It recommends since 2.0.18
  as much as possible to be used.
* There is directory traversal in version 2.0.15 or
  older. We strongly recommend to use 2.0.16 or later.
* There is cross-site scripting vulnerability in version 2.0.13 or
  older.
* There is a security hole a malicious third party can make
  some garbage files with a permission of CGI executor
  in version 1.3.0.10 or older.
* We stopped to maintain version 1.2 or older. There is strong
  possibility that they would have some security holes or bugs.
  We strongly recommend to use the latest version of Namazu.

## Discussion

* It is helpless about DDoS like very frequent access (e.g. 1000 times in a minute) .
  ([See also: waste of resources](#resources))* You must not use HTTP Server as root privilege, it is naturally.* You must not setuid namazu.cgi, it is unnecessary.* namazu.cgi didn't use system(3).* Version 1.2.0.2 or later of namazu.cgi hadn't use any external
          commands (no fork and/or exec).* Writing NMZ.slog isn't locked.* namazu.cgi has a restriction about max result output
              (default: 100).* namazu/namazu.cgi has a restriction about max indices
                (default: 64).* Search operation ends in few seconds when things come to the worst
                  (the worst operation is regrex).* No infinity loop (maybe).* Anyone can't output any HTML tags with any CGI parameters
                      on namazu.cgi. See also:
                      [Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability](#cross-site-scripting)* What happens when someone disconnected the HTTP session
                        in search processing?

                        -> The process is killed by the HTTP server (if you use Apache).* Use the latest version, if you can.* We can't promise there are no buffer overflow.
                            But we take special care in it.

## Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is the problem anyone can embed
any HTML tags to output of CGI by external input (like CGI parameters)
, and interpret it as valid HTML tags or client side script
(like JavaScript).

It is no effects on server side. However, it should be important
effects on client side.
If you use HTTP cookie, there is possibility of discovering
value of HTTP cookie by malicious people. It is dangerous in
some situation.

The following links are helpful information about XSS;
[CA-2000-02: Malicious HTML Tags Embedded in Client Requests](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html)
(CERT)
[The Cross Site Scripting FAQ](http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml)
(Cgisecurity.com)
[Information about cross-site scripting vulnerability on web sites](http://www.ipa.go.jp/security/ciadr/20011023css.html)
(Written in Japanese)
(IPA security center)
### The problem produced when query begins from a tab (%09)

2.0.13 Up to before namazu.cgi begins from a tab (%09).
If query is specified, a reference character sequence
will no longer be sanitized and cross-site scripting brittleness will occur.
2.0.14 By henceforth, this problem was coped with by deleting a top tab.

Workaround to 2.0.13 and before :

1. move namazu.cgi and .namazurc to a place where you cannot access with http.
Assuming you move to /usr/local/lib.

2. create the script blow named namazu.cgi, and grant execution permission.

2.1. script by sh

````

#!/bin/sh
QUERY_STRING=`echo "$QUERY_STRING" | sed -e 's/y=%09/y=%20/g'`
export QUERY_STRING
/usr/local/lib/namazu.cgi

````
2.2. script by perl

````

!#/usr/bin/perl
$ENV{QUERY_STRING}=~s/y=%09/y=%20/g;
system("/usr/local/lib/namazu.cgi");

````

### Around Standard Error Issue

namazu.cgi (2.0.10 or earlier) outputs warning messages to standard error.
It causes cross-site scripting issue because some implementations of
web server,
for example, Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 and 5.0,
treat standard error as same as standard output.

To solve the issue, we changed namazu.cgi (since 2.0.11) to output
warning messages to NMZ.warnlog file instead standard error.

According to [CGI specification](http://www.w3c.org/CGI/),
it isn't mentioned about standard error. We suspect it is failure of
web server implementation. However, we think all CGI developers need to
notice this fact because such implementations exist.
## Waste of resources

Namazu supports regular expression search. It wastes CPU power
when it used with complex regular expression.

The server can be prevented from negatively affecting other processing by excessive operation of CGI in limiting the server resource used.

In Apache 2.0, the server resource can be limited by using the RLimitCPU/RLimitMEM/RLimitNPROC directive.

[Only UNIX]

namazu.cgi stops the process in 60 seconds by default.
Up to 2.0.13, it can configured by SUICIDE\_TIME directive.

[UNIX/Windows]

It can disabled regular expression search by REGEX\_SEARCH directive.

If you use Namazu for external use, you need to configure such
directives properly.

## Attention concerning OLE control filter(Windows limitation)

When the Office document file (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Ichitaro
document and others) including the macro virus is processed when the
OLE control filter is used with Namazu of the Windows version, the
possibility that catches the wog cannot be completely denied.

The Office do application of the Office document file including the
macro virus (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, and Ichitaro and others)
and the dangers of this extent ..the opening...

There is a possibility that the macro is executed when an old version
and the security setting of Microsoft Office have been changed.

Please remove the virus to the document processed with mknmz
beforehand with the anti virus software to make sure.

Moreover, the virus check works when the OLE control filter opens the
Office document file when the anti-virus software corresponding to
anti-virus API is installed. We will recommend this function to be
used together.

Example) Norton AntiVirus 2005

The OLE control filter that Namazu Project offers is olemsword.pl,
oleexcel.pl at present, olepowerpoint.pl, oletaro.pl, olertf.pl, and
olevisio.pl.

Besides this, there is OLE control filter that the third party made,
too.

* Even if the Auto\_Open macro is included in the Excel document file, it
  is not executed.
* Index object when OLE control filter operates
  It is necessary to note it because the file of mail in the attached
  file and the archive is passed to the OLE control filter when the
  archive file such as --decode-base64 use of Office of the folder of
  there is no document of the option (The influence of -- decode-base64
  is not received because it is processed with mhonarc.pl at the E-mail
  converted into the HTML form with MHonArc), and zip and gzip files is
  processed with the corresponding filter.
* Because the macro is not executed, it is never exposed to this
  threat for the Office document filters other than the OLE control
  filter.
* Because the OLE control filter cannot be used in UNIX version Namazu,
  it is never exposed to this threat.
* It can be confirmed whether the OLE control filter operates as mknmz -C.

### Attention of --decode-base64 option (Windows limitation)

Option --decode-base64 ..the addition.. does to E-mail/NetNews the
decipherment it as for the appended Base64 encode part and puts out ..
taking out.. to mknmz of Namazu 2.0.15.

It takes out by --decode-base64 when the Office document file
including the macro virus is appended to E-mail/NetNews and there is
an infected possibility with the virus as well as "Attention
concerning the OLE control filter" when processing it with the OLE
control filter.

Please remove the virus to E-mail/NetNews processed with mknmz
beforehand with the anti virus software to make sure.

* E-mail/NetNews as long as the --decode-base64 option is not specified.
  The Office document file to which is appended is never processed with
  taking out OLE control filter.
* The influence of -- decode-base64 is not received because it is
  processed with mhonarc.pl at the E-mail converted into the HTML form
  with MHonArc.

### Attention of archive file(Windows limitation)

There is an infected possibility with the virus as well as "Attention
concerning the OLE control filter" when processing it with the OLE
control filter when the Office document file including the macro virus
is included in the archive file.

Please remove the virus to the archive file processed with mknmz
beforehand with the anti virus software to make sure.

## Directory traversal

Namazu uses some template files for different languages.
It is identified by LANG environment or lang parameter of CGI.
In some situation, any remote user can access files in server
by lang parameter with relative directory representation.
It is called as
[directory traversal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_traversal).

The problem caused by the following sequence:

* Call cgi with the parameter lang=/../../foo* Namazu template files are named with .${lang} suffix.* In the result, namazu.cgi tried to open NMZ.head./../../foo* If you have the directory "NMZ.head.", the attacker
        can access NMZ.head./../../foo file.

There is the same problem on result cgi parameter.

Especially in Windows environment, relative path with non-existence
directory is accessible. The following is an example:
```

C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator>type ..\..\foo\..\boot.ini
[boot loader]
timeout=30
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS
(snip)

```
The above example, C:\foo is not exist.
Linux system can't access any file with non-existence directory,
but we didn't recognize other Unix-like systems, but almost systems
would be not effected.

The problem was fixed in Namazu 2.0.16. If you use Windows,
we strongly suggest to upgrade it.
It was reported by Jeff Porter,thank you.

[pnamazu
pure perl implementation of namazu.cgi, also effects the problem.
If you use pnamazu, upgrade it.](http://www01.tcp-ip.or.jp/~furukawa/pnamazu/)

## Weakness of retrieval type that is UTF-7 encoding by misidentification of encode automatic operation recognition of Web browser

Namazu.cgi before Namazu 2.0.17 doesn't output charset to ContentType
of the response header in default.

Therefore, Web browser displays encode from the output result of
namazu.cgi recognizing it automatically.

When the character string that is the UTF-7 encoding is specified for
the retrieval type, the character string that is the UTF-7 encoding is
included in the output of namazu.cgi almost as it is. At this time, it
is likely to misidentify it to UTF-7 by the encode automatic operation
recognition of Web browser. (Chiefly for an English site. )Therefore,
there is a possibility being executed for an arbitrary script in user's
browser when the script that is the UTF-7 encoding is specified for the
retrieval type.

(cross site scripting weakness)

It was corrected that charset was output to ContentType of the
response header without fail in Namazu 2.0.18 for this measures.
This problem can be evaded by the version's improving to Namazu 2.0.18.

Moreover, Namazu : ContentType of the response header since 2.0.6. The
function to specify directly with .namazurc is possessed.
Therefore, this problem can be evaded even by the version before Namazu
2.0.17 by specifying it for ContentType of .namazurc including charset.

```

Example 1) For Japanese(UNIX)

ContentType "text/html; charset=EUC-JP"

Example 2) For Japanese(Windows)

ContentType "text/html; charset=Shift_JIS"

Example 3) For English

ContentType "text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"

```

Charset corresponding to the language is automatically added when
charset is not included in ContentType since Namazu 2.0.18.
Charset corresponding to the language can be specified by the Charset
directive for the language not supported by default by Namazu.

```

The example) Eo (Esperanto) is associated with ISO-8859-3.

Charset "eo" "ISO-8859-3"

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
