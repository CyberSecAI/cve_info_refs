Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability:** Username Enumeration through Error Messages

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way IBM Rational ClearQuest Web handles unsuccessful login attempts. The error messages produced by these attempts provide enough information to allow an attacker to determine if a username is valid or not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The application reveals whether a given username exists based on different error messages.
*   **Lack of Proper Error Handling:** Error messages should be generic to prevent information leakage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Username Enumeration:** Attackers can systematically attempt different usernames and identify valid accounts. This can be used as a stepping stone for further attacks (e.g., password guessing, targeted phishing).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability exists within the login pages of the ClearQuest web application.
*   **Scripted Attacks:** The vulnerability can be exploited using automated scripts that repeatedly try different usernames.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the ClearQuest web application's login page.
*   **Basic Scripting Skills:** To automate the enumeration process.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is identified as APAR PK55561
*   The issue was fixed in ClearQuest Web versions 7.0.1.1-ifix01 and 7.0.0.2-ifix01.
*   The vulnerability was reported on 2007-10-26 and the fix was released on 2008-03-04
