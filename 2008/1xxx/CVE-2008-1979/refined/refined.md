      "root_cause": "The CA ARCserve Discovery Service (casdscvc) crashes due to an out-of-bounds read.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The vulnerability is due to an incrementer value (a 32-bit number) controlled by the attacker, which is used to locate the next data block. The vulnerability allows the reading of data outside of allocated memory."
      ],
      "impact": "The service casdscvc crashes. Initially, the process automatically restarts after about one minute but after two crashes it remained down.",

        "Remote exploitation is possible by sending crafted data to the casdscvc service listening on port 41523."
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable service on port 41523, and control the incrementer value. "
