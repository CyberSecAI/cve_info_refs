Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-1509

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw located within the search functionality of XLPortal version 2.2.4 and earlier. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the "query" parameter.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries. Specifically, the "query" parameter in the search functionality is vulnerable.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This could lead to:
    *   **Data theft:** Extraction of sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords (demonstrated in the provided exploit code).
    *   **Data manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    *   **Privilege escalation:** Potentially gaining higher-level access to the application.
    *   **Complete compromise:** In some scenarios, gaining complete control over the database server.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the web interface of the XLPortal application, specifically the "search" functionality.
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query and injects it via the "query" parameter in a POST request.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable XLPortal web application. This implies the attacker should be able to reach the web application over a network.
    *   The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and the general structure of SQL syntax to create a successful attack.

**Technical Details from Exploit Code:**

The provided Perl exploit code demonstrates the following:

1.  **HTTP Request Construction:** The exploit uses `LWP::UserAgent` to create a POST request to `index.php` with the `page=Szukaj` parameter.
2.  **SQL Injection Payload:** The core of the exploit is the SQL injection payload:
    ```perl
    $buff = "%27+union+select+1%2Cconcat%28user%2C0x3a%2Cpassword%29+from+".$ARGV[1]."_users+%2F*";
    ```
    *   `%27`: This is the URL-encoded single quote that starts the SQL injection string.
    *   `union select 1`: This will return a second result with column count that matches original query.
    *   `concat(user,0x3a,password)`: This extracts the username and password from the `_users` table, concatenated with a colon separator.
    *  `from ".$ARGV[1]."_users`: This specifies the table that will be queried, where the argument provided at runtime will be used to build the full table name.
3.  **Retrieving User and Password:** The exploit parses the HTTP response for the username and password, which are returned in the format username:password, and prints the captured credentials to the console.

This exploit code directly demonstrates how an attacker can use a SQL injection vulnerability to steal usernames and passwords from the database.
