- Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow occurs when constructing a log string due to insufficient buffer size for the filename.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow vulnerability in the TFTP server when logging filenames.
- Impact of exploitation: Remote code execution is possible by sending a TFTP filename exceeding 32 bytes.
- Attack vectors: Sending a TFTP request with a filename longer than 32 bytes.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Remote attacker is capable of sending TFTP requests to the vulnerable server.
