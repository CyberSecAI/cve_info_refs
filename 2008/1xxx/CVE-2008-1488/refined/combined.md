| | [Bug](bug.php?id=58105) #58105 | Usage of strcpy in apc.c can cause stack corruption with long filenames | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Submitted: | 2008-03-17 11:43 UTC | Modified: | 2008-03-25 00:43 UTC |  | | From: | Daniel dot Papasian at chronicle dot com | Assigned: |  | | Status: | Closed | Package: | [APC](search.php?cmd=display&package_name[]=APC) ([PECL](https://pecl.php.net/package/APC)) | | PHP Version: | 5.2.1 | OS: | FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE, RHEL4 | | Private report: | No | CVE-ID: | *None* |   View [Developer](bug.php?id=58105&edit=1) [Edit](bug.php?id=58105&edit=2)   **[2008-03-17 11:43 UTC] Daniel dot Papasian at chronicle dot com** ``` Description: ------------ There is a security vulnerability in at least the last several revisions of apc.c, including the last release version and CVS, due to lengths not being checked with strcpy.  If the filename is longer than the realpath array, stack corruption can occur, which could trivially lead to the webserver crashing, or execution of arbitrary code as the webserver.

I was merging from an earlier version of APC (where I found and fixed the version first, before forward-porting to CVS) where the second argument was filename, and missed it in the diff.  The patch should be right now.  The only thing changed was going from strcpy to strncpy and adding a bound:  <http://papasian.org/~dannyp/apc.patch.dpapasian>  ``` **[2008-03-17 16:23 UTC] Daniel dot Papasian at chronicle dot com** ``` And I should point out that my patch is probably not the most correct.  There should probably be an effort to terminate the string if it's overflowing, or do something else that's smarter -- not knowing the code too well, it's hard to say the proper way.  Here is another patch.  I'm also dropping some of the extra parentheses around the size argument.  This patch should ensure that the string is always terminated.  <http://papasian.org/~dannyp/apc.dpapasian.patch2>  ``` **[2008-03-22 18:46 UTC] Daniel dot Papasian at chronicle dot com** ``` I've written a more advanced proof of concept that uses the buffer overflow to actually execute code, instead of merely crash:  <http://papasian.org/~dannyp/apcsmash.php.txt>  It's still not the easiest thing to exploit because, on Linux at least, apc seems to be loaded into different parts of memory each time apache starts.  A committed attacker could simply brute force it, however, segfaulting a bunch of apache children until the sweet spot is found and the reverse shell opened.  ``` **[2008-03-25 00:23 UTC] Daniel dot Papasian at chronicle dot com** ``` This bug is referenced in CVE-2008-1488 <http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-1488>  ``` **[2008-03-25 00:43 UTC] [rasmus@php.net](//people.php.net/rasmus)** ``` Fixed in CVS.  We use strlcpy for this.   3.0.17 will be out shortly.  ``` |

The 0.9.X packages have been masked out until we do some more testing on them.  You can either wait with upgrading to 0.9.X untill it's safe, or try them out by unmasking them in /usr/portage/profile/package.maks.  If you choose to try the 0.9.X packages please update your portage tree first of all, since some important fixes went in a few minutes ago.  Thanks for the report. ``` |  |

# PECL APC: Buffer Overflow — GLSA **200804-07**

A buffer overflow vulnerability in PECL APC might allow for the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-php5/pecl-apc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.16-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.16-r1** |

### Background

PECL Alternative PHP Cache (PECL APC) is a free, open, and robust
framework for caching and optimizing PHP intermediate code.

### Description

Daniel Papasian discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the
apc\_search\_paths() function in the file apc.c when processing long
filenames.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
code in PHP applications that pass user-controlled input to the
include() function.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PECL APC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-php5/pecl-apc-3.0.16-r1"
```
