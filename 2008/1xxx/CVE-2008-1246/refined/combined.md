### [PIX/ASA Finesse 7.1 & 7.2 Privilege Escalation](http://hackathology.blogspot.com/2008/01/pixasa-finesse-71-72-privilege.html)

I was trying to get into admin mode without the enable password during a penetration test and i came across a post by Terry where he describes a designing flaw in the PIX/ASA Finesse Operation System, version 7.1 and 7.2. Well, it was possible to escalate a normal level 0 user to a level 15 privilege user. The exploit is simple and it only works locally, at the console and remotely with Telnet. However, do note that it will **NOT** work if SSH, TACACS or Radius is implemented in the firewall. Below are the steps.

1. Login with your user level 0 account. Once logon, you will be prompted to enter the enable password which is the privilege password.

2. At this prompt if you move your cursor forward with a space or character(it doesn't matter if there are more then one), and then proceed to delete any spaces or characters, by holding down the backspace a second after deleting the last character it should immediately drop you into level 15 privilege-exec mode.

It had been tested on PIX 515E, Finesse version 7.2 and i had also tested it on the PIX 525.

Cool way to have financial freedom!!! Are you tired of living a poor life, here is the opportunity you have been waiting for. Get the new ATM BLANK CARD that can hack any ATM MACHINE and withdraw money from any account. You do not require anybody’s account number before you can use it. Although you and I knows that its illegal,there is no risk using it. It has SPECIAL FEATURES, that makes the machine unable to detect this very card,and its transaction can’t be traced .You can use it anywhere in the world. With this card,you can withdraw nothing less than $4,500 a day. So to get the card,reach the hackers via email address : besthackersworld58@gmail.com or whatsapp him on +1(323)-723-2568

INSTEAD OF GETTING A LOAN Check out these blank ATM cards today!!

My name is Oliver from New york. A successful business owner and father. I got one of these already programmed blank ATM cards that allows me withdraw a maximum of $5,000 daily for 30 days. I am so happy about these cards because I received mine last week and have already used it to get $20,000. Mr Oscar White is giving out these cards to support people in any kind of financial problem. I must be sincere to you, when i first saw the advert, I believed it to be illegal and a hoax but when I contacted Mr Oscar White, he confirmed to me that although it is illegal, nobody gets caught while using these cards because they have been programmed to disable every communication once inserted into any Automated Teller Machine(ATM). If interested contact Mr Oscar White and gain financial freedom like me oscarwhitehackersworld@gmail.com or whats-app +1(513)-299-8247 as soon as possible .

God Bless

I was searching for loan to sort out my bills& debts, then i saw comments about Blank ATM Credit Card that can be hacked to withdraw money from any ATM machines around you . I doubted thus but decided to give it a try by contacting {Blankatmoffice@gmail.com} they responded with their guidelines on how the card works. I was assured that the card can withdraw $5,000 instant per day & was credited with $50,000.00 so i requested for one & paid the delivery fee to obtain the card, after 24 hours later, i was shock to see the UPS agent in my resident with a parcel{card} i signed and went back inside and confirmed the card work's after the agent left. This is no doubts because i have the card & has made used of the card. This hackers are USA based hackers set out to help people with financial freedom!!
