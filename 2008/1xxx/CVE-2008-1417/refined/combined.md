Subject: axyl: Insecure temporary file handling in prerm and postrm
Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2008 19:42:46 +0100
```
Package: axyl
Version: 2.1.7
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

The prerm script creates /tmp/axyl.conf by copying /etc/axyl/axyl.conf over
it.

The postrm script sources that file.

That opens opportunities to someone with a local account to trigger
execution of malicious code by crafting /tmp/axyl.conf (it probably requires
to ensure that the "cp" action in prerm fails to avoid the crafter file to
be overwritten).

Even if the exploit possibilities may be small, this is still pretty
dangerous to keep.

An easy and not too much invasive fix would be to copy the file in /root
instead of /tmp.

PS: the severity may be overflated and I don't feel like I have enough
security experience to really decide whether this is release critical and
also if it deserves an update to stable and oldstable. I will fix this in a
soon-to-come NMU (meant for l10n purposes) with the above quick and dirty
fix (thanks to Nico Golde for the suggestion).

Hi,
Christian noticed that this file actually get overwritten in
the prerm script. This still means that the prerm script is
vulnerable to a symlink attack. An attacker creating a
symlink from /someimportantfile to /tmp/axyl.conf would
overwrite the content of someimportantfile on a removal of
axyl. CVE id requested.

Cheers
Nico

Please note that I found this while preparing an l10n NMU (just like I
wanted to do for axyl-lucene, but suspended when you mentioned you
will take care of fixing l10n bugs).

So, I suggest you deal with the issue as you're the package maintainer
but, please also fix pending l10n bugs.

My prepared NMU had the following changelog:

  * Debconf translations:
    - Portuguese. Closes: #[415510](bugreport.cgi?bug=415510)
    - German. Closes: #[425763](bugreport.cgi?bug=425763)
    - French. Closes: #[441090](bugreport.cgi?bug=441090)
    - Spanish. Closes: #[467027](bugreport.cgi?bug=467027)
    - Finnish. Closes: #[470638](bugreport.cgi?bug=470638)
  * [Lintian] Move the axyl-doc package to section doc

So, as you see, the five pending debconf l10n bugs plus a small fix to
put axy-doc in the "doc" section.

I am not sure about this either. However I see no real way
besides this to fix this. If you use mktemp or something
similar you can't pass the name to postrm :/
Paul, is this code really needed anyway?

Kind regards
Nico

It would be good to get clarification on this point.

Just to be sure everyone understands what is happening here (and maybe suggest a better way).

The requirement is to purge Axyl fully (apt-get remove --purge). For that the postrm script needs to
know the current locations of home, data and logs which the user may have changed since
installation. These are defined in /etc/axyl/axyl.conf but this file is removed by the time postrm runs.

Hence I currently copy it to a temporary location in prerm for the short time that the purge runs,
then source it from that temporary location in postrm, use the settings to purge the home, data and
log areas for Axyl-owned content, and then finally remove the temporary conf file.

Root is doing this, and I imagined (perhaps erroneously) that using /root for this brief staging of
the conf file would have been ok.

If not then what is a better way to carry the conf settings from prerm --> postrm? Would the debconf
db do the trick, or is that purged by then too?

Any help very much appreciated.;-)

Cheers,
Paul.

I guess you should only purge the default location, following the
principle of least surprise.  Certainly I wouldn't expect a package to
change the file system outside the package just because I listed some
directories in the configuration file.

I couldn't find a policy rule for this case, but I suspect there is one.

Well it used to do something like that, but then whilst fixing bug #431710 in axyl-lucene, and
testing this by running piuparts, I discovered that I had piuparts errors complaining that I hadn't
removed all package content on purge. I assumed that this was new policy to keep systems clean of
cruft (I could see the reasoning), and so changed my packages accordingly.

It should be noted that, having looked just now, I can't actually find official policy on this
concept of purging absolutely *everything* in this way, so I'm not sure what the piuparts errors
were based on.

If full purge isn't official policy, then the quick fix would be to remove this functionality
entirely for now, and I'd be quite happy to do that.

Cheers,
Paul.

I'm pretty sure that nothing in the policy *or common practice*
requires package maintainers to clean out data in cases where they
were stored in the non default locations for the package.

So, if that's the only rationale for the /tmp/axyl.conf stuff, I'd
suggest to remove this mechanism.

I'm quite unsure that writing to /root upon purge is a good idea.

If you really need to retain those settings to purge, better do it this way:
1) In prerm, copy /etc/axyl/axyl.conf to /etc/axyl/axyl.conf.backup
2) In postrm, source that file.
3) In postrm, rm /etc/axyl/axyl.conf.backup && rmdir /etc/axyl/

But I doubt that it's useful to retain those settings at postrm as has been
indicated by others in this bug already. As you source the file, what happens
in a scenario where the admin has a syntax error in axyl.conf and then purges
it? The purge will fail with an error, also not so nice.

It's rather undefined in policy what exactly should be purged, unfortunately.

I propose to just remove every dir we installed and let the admin take care of
whatever extra dirs he added. That seems in spirit of Debian policy: clean up
what we install, and don't touch things outside of it.

That would also mean that piuparts would not complain, since that does not add
dirs to axyl.conf itself, does it?

Hi Paul,

Upon a second look at the code, I can find a few more occurences of tempfile
usage that are at least suspicious. Just try a grep for "/tmp" on the axyl
source package to see what I mean. Are these all safe?

That's correct. In the tests it uses the default locations. My purge was
designed to just get rid of Axyl home, data, logs wherever the admin had
decided to put them in the debconf config (or perhaps moved them
manually afterwards).

But I will now be implementing the proposition above, which will remove
the need to save axyl.conf across prerm --> postrm.

Thanks for all the great ideas and feedback.

Cheers,
Paul.

Some of the matches appear to be in docs, some in Xinha (an included
javascript Wysiwyg editor). However there are a couple I missed in Axyl
which I will fix for this coming upload.

Changes:
 axyl (2.2.0) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * Added 'axyl' command shell. Makes create/remove of websites
     that much easier. Should have been done much earlier (duh).
   * Removed /tmp usage(s) for security reasons. This also changes
     package purge behaviour from deleting all home, data and log
     content, to only deleting it if it is located in the default
     locations. (closes: #[471227](bugreport.cgi?bug=471227))
   * Moved to debra-controlled releases, using major/minor nos.
   * Changed/enhanced some of the detection and install scripts used
     in postinst, site creates and db upgrading.
   * Further Php4/Php5 compatibility work. Create clone() function only
     defined for Php4, and used this where object copies are required.
     Should be no change to functionality.
   * Removed HTMLarea. Xinha is now used instead.
   * Debconf - Spanish template. (closes: #[467027](bugreport.cgi?bug=467027))
