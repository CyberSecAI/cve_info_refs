Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The `prerm` script of the `axyl` package creates a temporary file `/tmp/axyl.conf` by copying `/etc/axyl/axyl.conf` to it. The `postrm` script then sources this temporary file. This process creates a vulnerability because of insecure handling of the temporary file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** The use of `/tmp/axyl.conf` as a temporary file without proper security measures.
*   **Symlink Vulnerability:** A local attacker can create a symbolic link from a sensitive file to `/tmp/axyl.conf`. When the `prerm` script executes `cp /etc/axyl/axyl.conf /tmp/axyl.conf`, it will overwrite the target of the symlink with the content of `/etc/axyl/axyl.conf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A local user can overwrite arbitrary files on the system by creating a symlink to the target file, and then triggering the package removal.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** The attacker needs a local user account on the system to create a symlink.
*   **Package Removal Trigger:** The attacker needs to trigger the removal of the `axyl` package for the `prerm` script to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   A local user account on the system.
*   Ability to create symlinks.
*   Ability to trigger package removal via `apt`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The original report suggested that a crafted `/tmp/axyl.conf` could be sourced, potentially executing arbitrary code. However, it was noted that the `cp` action in the `prerm` script overwrites the temporary file, mitigating the direct code injection risk.
*   The vulnerability was initially reported as "grave" but later downgraded to "important."
*   The fix in `axyl` version 2.2.0 involved removing the temporary file usage and changing the purge behavior.
* The maintainer initially attempted to use /root for the temporary file, but this was deemed a potential policy violation.
*  The fix removed the functionality that purged data in non-default locations.
