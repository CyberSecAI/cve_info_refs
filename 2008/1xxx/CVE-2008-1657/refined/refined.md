```
{
  "CVE-2008-1657": {
    "Description": "The OpenSSH server (sshd) executes the ~/.ssh/rc file even when the ForceCommand directive is enabled in sshd_config, which allows local users to bypass intended command restrictions and execute arbitrary commands if they have write access to the ~/.ssh/rc file.",
    "Root cause": "The sshd daemon incorrectly executes the ~/.ssh/rc file despite the presence of a ForceCommand directive.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a security policy."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation. A local attacker can bypass the intended restrictions of the ForceCommand directive and execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user whose SSH session they are exploiting.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local user with write access to their home directory can create or modify the ~/.ssh/rc file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have local access to the target system and the ability to write to their home directory in order to create or modify the ~/.ssh/rc file."
