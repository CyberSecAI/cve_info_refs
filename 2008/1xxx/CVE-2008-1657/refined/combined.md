How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

* **001: SECURITY FIX: March 30, 2008**
    *All architectures*

  sshd(8) would execute ~/.ssh/rc even when a sshd\_config(5) *ForceCommand*
  directive was in effect, allowing users with write access to this file to
  execute arbitrary commands. This behaviour was documented, but was an unsafe
  default and an extra hassle for administrators.

    successfully.

            *All architectures*

          Some kinds of IPv6 usage would leak kernel memory (in particular, this path
          was exercised by the named(8) patch for port randomization). Since INET6 is
          enabled by default, this condition affects all systems.

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: October 2, 2008**
              *All architectures*

            The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ndp) did not correctly verify neighbor
            solicitation requests maybe allowing a nearby attacker to intercept traffic.
            The attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for
            this vulnerability to be exploited.

                *All architectures*

              The OpenSSL libraries did not correctly check the return value from
              certain verification functions, allowing validation to be bypassed and
              permitting a remote attacker to conduct a "man in the middle attack"
              against SSL/TLS connections if the server is configured with a DSA or ECDSA
              certificate.

                  Upon reception of an invalid update with 4-byte AS attributes, bgpd -
                  adhering to the RFCs - closed the session to the neighbor.
                  This error in the specification allowed 3rd parties to close remote BGP
                  sessions.
                  In the worst case Internet connectivity could be lost.

                      group is used in the RunAs portion of the rule. The bug only manifests
                      when the user being granted privileges is also a member of the group
                      in the RunAs portion of the rule.

                        The OpenSSL ASN.1 handling code could be forced to perform invalid memory
                        accesses through the use of certain invalid strings
                        ([CVE-2009-0590](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0590))
                        or under certain error conditions triggerable by invalid ASN.1 structures
                        ([CVE-2009-0789](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0789)).
                        These vulnerabilities could be exploited to achieve a
                        denial-of-service. A more detailed description of these problems is available
                        in the
                        [OpenSSL security advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20090325.txt), but note that the other issue described there "Incorrect Error
                        Checking During CMS verification" relates to code not enabled in OpenBSD.

                        * **013: RELIABILITY FIX: April 11, 2009**
                            *All architectures*

                          When pf attempts to perform translation on a specially crafted IP datagram,
                          a null pointer dereference will occur, resulting in a kernel panic.
                          In certain configurations this may be triggered by a remote attacker.

                          Restricting translation rules to protocols that are specific to the IP version
                          in use, is an effective workaround until the patch can be installed. As an
                          example, for IPv4 nat/binat/rdr rules you can use:
                          ```

                              nat/rdr ... inet proto { tcp udp icmp } ...

                          ```
                          Or for IPv6 nat/binat/rdr rules you can use:
                          ```

                              nat/rdr ... inet6 proto { tcp udp icmp6 } ...

                          ```

# OpenSSH: Privilege escalation — GLSA **200804-03**

Two flaws have been discovered in OpenSSH which could allow local attackers
to escalate their privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/openssh** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.7\_p1-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.7\_p1-r6** |

### Background

OpenSSH is a complete SSH protocol implementation that includes an SFTP
client and server support.

### Description

Two issues have been discovered in OpenSSH:

* Timo Juhani
  Lindfors discovered that OpenSSH sets the DISPLAY variable in SSH
  sessions using X11 forwarding even when it cannot bind the X11 server
  to a local port in all address families (CVE-2008-1483).
* OpenSSH will execute the contents of the ".ssh/rc" file even when
  the "ForceCommand" directive is enabled in the global sshd\_config
  (CVE-2008-1657).

### Impact

A local attacker could exploit the first vulnerability to hijack
forwarded X11 sessions of other users and possibly execute code with
their privileges, disclose sensitive data or cause a Denial of Service,
by binding a local X11 server to a port using only one address family.
The second vulnerability might allow local attackers to bypass intended
security restrictions and execute commands other than those specified
by "ForceCommand" if they are able to write to their home directory.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSH users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/openssh-4.7_p1-r6"
```
### References

* [CVE-2008-1483](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1483)
* [CVE-2008-1657](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1657)

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenSSH X access leakage and ForceCommand bypass
OpenSSH was updated to fix two security problems potentially
exploitable by local users.
- A flaw in the X forwarding code of openssh allowed local
malicious users to steal the X access credentials of other users
(CVE-2008-1483).
- Due to another flaw users could bypass the option "ForceCommand"
(CVE-2008-1657).
- Opera 9.27 security update
The web-browser Opera was updated to version 9.27 to fix various
security issues.
A flaw in the image processing routines could crash opera. Attackers could
potentially even exploit that to execute code.
Opera was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

provided that the advisory is not modified in any way. In particular, the
clear text signature should show proof of the authenticity of the text.

# USN-649-1: OpenSSH vulnerabilities

1 October 2008

OpenSSH vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [openssh](/security/cves?package=openssh) -

## Details

It was discovered that the ForceCommand directive could be bypassed.

If a local user created a malicious ~/.ssh/rc file, they could execute

arbitrary commands as their user id. This only affected Ubuntu 7.10.

([CVE-2008-1657](/security/CVE-2008-1657))

USN-355-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenSSH. It was discovered that the

fixes for this issue were incomplete. A remote attacker could attempt

multiple logins, filling all available connection slots, leading to a

denial of service. This only affected Ubuntu 6.06 and 7.04.

([CVE-2008-4109](/security/CVE-2008-4109))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

=== Content from www.openssh.com_2c316c24_20250125_213020.html ===
OpenSSH 4.9 was released on 2008-03-31. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.
T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures
and more information can be found at:
http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html and
http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html
For international orders use http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order
and for European orders, use http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu
Note that OpenSSH 4.8 was an OpenBSD-only release shipped with the
OpenBSD 4.3 CD.
Changes since OpenSSH 4.7:
============================
Security:
\* Disable execution of ~/.ssh/rc for sessions where a command has been
forced by the sshd\_config ForceCommand directive. Users who had
write access to this file could use it to execute abritrary commands.
This behaviour was documented, but was an unsafe default and an extra
hassle for administrators.
New features:
\* Added chroot(2) support for sshd(8), controlled by a new option
"ChrootDirectory". Please refer to sshd\_config(5) for details, and
please use this feature carefully. (bz#177 bz#1352)
\* Linked sftp-server(8) into sshd(8). The internal sftp server is
used when the command "internal-sftp" is specified in a Subsystem
or ForceCommand declaration. When used with ChrootDirectory, the
internal sftp server requires no special configuration of files
inside the chroot environment. Please refer to sshd\_config(5) for
more information.
\* Added a "no-user-rc" option for authorized\_keys to disable execution
of ~/.ssh/rc
\* Added a protocol extension method "posix-rename@openssh.com" for
sftp-server(8) to perform POSIX atomic rename() operations.
(bz#1400)
\* Removed the fixed limit of 100 file handles in sftp-server(8). The
server will now dynamically allocate handles up to the number of
available file descriptors. (bz#1397)
\* ssh(8) will now skip generation of SSH protocol 1 ephemeral server
keys when in inetd mode and protocol 2 connections are negotiated.
This speeds up protocol 2 connections to inetd-mode servers that
also allow Protocol 1 (bz#440)
\* Accept the PermitRootLogin directive in a sshd\_config(5) Match
block. Allows for, e.g. permitting root only from the local
network.
\* Reworked sftp(1) argument splitting and escaping to be more
internally consistent (i.e. between sftp commands) and more
consistent with sh(1). Please note that this will change the
interpretation of some quoted strings, especially those with
embedded backslash escape sequences. (bz#778)
\* Support "Banner=none" in sshd\_config(5) to disable sending of a
pre-login banner (e.g. in a Match block).
\* ssh(1) ProxyCommands are now executed with $SHELL rather than
/bin/sh.
\* ssh(1)'s ConnectTimeout option is now applied to both the TCP
connection and the SSH banner exchange (previously it just covered
the TCP connection). This allows callers of ssh(1) to better detect
and deal with stuck servers that accept a TCP connection but don't
progress the protocol, and also makes ConnectTimeout useful for
connections via a ProxyCommand.
\* Many new regression tests, including interop tests against PuTTY's
plink.
\* Support BSM auditing on Mac OS X
The following bugs have been fixed in this release:
- scp(1) incorrectly reported "stalled" on slow copies. (bz#799)
- scp(1) date underflow for timestamps before epoch. (bz#828)
- scp(1) and sftp(1) progressmeter type fixes. (bz#842)
- SSH2\_MSG\_UNIMPLEMENTED packets did not correctly reset the client
keepalive logic, causing disconnections on servers that did not
explicitly implement "keepalive@openssh.com". (bz#1307)
- ssh(1) used the obsolete SIG DNS RRtype for host keys in DNS,
instead of the current standard RRSIG. (bz#1317)
- Extract magic buffer size constants in scp(1) to #defines.
(bz#1333)
- Correctly drain ACKs when a sftp(1) upload write fails midway,
avoids a fatal() exit from what should be a recoverable condition.
(bz#1354)
- Avoid pointer arithmetic and strict aliasing warnings. (bz#1355)
- Fixed packet size advertisements. Previously TCP and agent
forwarding incorrectly advertised the channel window size as the
packet size, causing fatal errors under some conditions. (bz#1360)
- Document KbdInteractiveAuthentication in sshd\_config(5). (bz#1367)
- Fixed sftp(1) file handle leak on download when the local file
could not be opened. (bz#1375)
- Fixed ssh-keygen(1) selective host key hashing (i.e.
"ssh-keygen -HF hostname") to not include any IP address in the
data to be hashed. (bz#1376)
- Fix clobbering of struct passwd from multiple getpwid calls,
resulting in fatal errors inside tilde\_expand\_filename. (bz#1377)
- Fix parsing of port-forwarding specifications to correctly
detect errors in either specified port number. (bz#1378)
- Fix memory leak in ssh(1) ~ escape commandline handling. (bz#1379)
- Make ssh(1) skip listening on the IPv6 wildcard address when a
binding address of 0.0.0.0 is used against an old SSH server that
does not support the RFC4254 syntax for wildcard bind addresses.
(bz#1381)
- Remove extra backslashes in the RB\_PROTOTYPE macro definition.
(bz#1385)
- Support ssh(1) RekeyLimits up to the maximum allowed by the
protocol: 2\*\*32-1. (bz#1390)
- Enable IPV6\_V6ONLY socket option on sshd(8) listen socket, as is
already done for X11/TCP forwarding sockets. (bz#1392)
- Fix FD leak that could hang a ssh(1) connection multiplexing
master. (bz#1398)
- Improve error messages when hostname resolution fails due to a
system error. (bz#1417)
- Make ssh(1) -q option documentation consistent with reality.
(bz#1427 bz#1429)
Portable OpenSSH bugs fixed:
- Fixed sshd(8) PAM support not calling pam\_session\_close(), or
failing to call it with root privileges. (bz#926)
- Made sshd(8) use configuration-specified SyslogFacility for
hosts\_access(3) messages for denied connections. (bz#1042)
- Implement getgrouplist(3) for AIX, enabling NSS LDAP to work on
this platform. (bz#1081)
- Fix compilation errors on AIX due to misdefinition of LLONG\_MAX.
(bz#1347)
- Force use of local glob(3) implementation on Mac OS X and FreeBSD,
as the platform versions lack features or have unexpected
behaviour. (bz#1407)
- Reduce stdout/stderr noise from ssh-copy-id. (bz#1431)
- Fix activation of OpenSSL engine support when requested in
configure. (bz#1437)
Checksums:
==========
- SHA1 (openssh-4.9.tar.gz) = fa7d1b3dcb093bd0dfc643b33b1a57a26f459373
- SHA1 (openssh-4.9p1.tar.gz) = 91575878883065bd777f82b47e0d481ac69ee7fe
