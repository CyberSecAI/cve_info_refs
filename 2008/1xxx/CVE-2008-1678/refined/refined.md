## Analysis of CVE-2008-1678

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1678:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a memory leak within the `mod_ssl` module of the Apache HTTP Server when used in conjunction with OpenSSL versions 0.9.8f through 0.9.8h.
*   Specifically, the `zlib_stateful_init` function in OpenSSL's `crypto/comp/c_zlib.c` allocates memory (`struct zlib_state`) when a client indicates support for zlib compression in the SSL handshake.
*   However, the corresponding function `zlib_stateful_free_ex_data` responsible for freeing this allocated memory is not always called leading to a memory leak.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak, where allocated memory is not released after use.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeated connections that trigger the memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion, especially server memory.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of successful exploitation is a denial-of-service (DoS). The memory leak leads to the exhaustion of server resources, eventually causing the Apache server to crash. In severe cases, it could lead to the operating system's Out-of-Memory killer terminating the Apache process.
*  **Application Instability:** The vulnerability leads to application instability which can manifest in dropped connections or failed handshakes with the client.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based.
*   **SSL/TLS Handshake:** The vulnerability is triggered during the SSL/TLS handshake process, specifically when the client indicates support for zlib compression.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Ability to send network requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send SSL/TLS requests to the vulnerable Apache server and should be able to control whether to use zlib compression or not.
*  **Knowledge of vulnerable versions:** The attacker needs some prior knowledge that the server uses vulnerable versions of OpenSSL and Apache.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The issue arises in OpenSSL versions 0.9.8f through 0.9.8h due to changes introduced in OpenSSL's code with commit id 15897.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a client sends an SSL/TLS request with support for compression which causes `zlib_stateful_init` to allocate the memory but does not always free this allocated memory when the connection is finished.
*   The fix involves removing the call to `CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data` in the `ssl_cleanup_pre_config` function, thereby preventing the memory leak.

**Affected Software:**

*   Apache HTTP Server (mod\_ssl module) when linked with vulnerable versions of OpenSSL.
*   OpenSSL versions 0.9.8f through 0.9.8h.
*   Ubuntu 7.10, openSUSE 10.2-11.0, SLES10, SLES9, NLD9, OES, NLPOS9, SLED, Fedora 9 and other distributions that used the vulnerable software versions.
*   Mac OS X v10.5.5, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade Apache HTTP Server and OpenSSL to patched versions.
*   Disable zlib compression on the server side.
*   Apply the fix provided by Apache, which involves removing the call to `CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data` in `modules/ssl/mod_ssl.c`.
