How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=44975#c0)  Dustin Kirkland    2008-05-12 08:52:53 UTC  ``` We have encountered an easily reproducible memory leak with Apache2 + mod_ssl with zlib encryption enabled.  Reproducing the problem is as simple as running Apache-bench against a vulnerable host:   ab -n 10000 -c 20 -f tls1 <https://vulnerable.host.example.com:443/>  Vulnerable hosts seem to be (apache >= 2.2.4) + (openssl >= 0.9.8e).  Depending on how much memory is available on the server, you may need to scale the value of -n up or down.  With 128MB in a virtual machine -n 1000 is enough to manifest the problem.

It solves the Out-of-memory errors and the killing of the Apache processes for consuming all system memory.  However, on the client end when running ab, I still see lots of: SSL read failed - closing connection SSL handshake failed (5).  It looks like it's just dropping the SSL connections when it gets busy.  As recently as Apache 2.2.3, I can run the same ab tests with no problems on either the client (dropping SSL connections) or the server (running out of memory).  :-Dustin ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=44975#c3)  Dustin Kirkland    2008-05-13 07:34:45 UTC  ``` Actually, I stand corrected.  Please disregard my previous post.  I did not apply the patch cleanly, and therefore those tests were invalid.  I have since cleanly applied the patch, and it does in fact solve the issue.  Thank you very much for your prompt response.  We should be publishing updated packages for Ubuntu shortly.

I use the same test scenario for Apache2.2.10 but the memory usage is always around 20,000kb. for Apache 2.0.63, it will grow up 490,000KB after I run  abs -n 100000 -c 149 -f tls1 <https://localhost:443/> about 10 times.

If you diff mod_ssl.c between Apache 2.0.63 and apache 2.2.10, there are quite a few differences between them.  Can I simply copy mod_ssl.c from apache 2.2.10 over mod_ssl.c from Apache 2.0.63 and expect it to work?  BTW, I am not even sure if they are the same problem. I just know that when I run abs -n 100000 -c 149 -f tls1 <https://localhost:443> 10 times, Apache will consume around 490,000KB. It will increase about 51MB each time I run it.

I download the following installer from Apache web site: apache2.0.63-x86-openssl-0.9.7m.msi  It uses OpenSSL 0.9.7 alreay and still has the same problem.

I've done some more investigation by taking the source code from 2.2.10 and build it and use our current httpd.conf from 2.0.x. To my surprise, I can still reproduce the problem with the source code in 2.2.10. If download 2.2.10 installer and use that, the problem does not exist.  I then do a diff and migrate the change one by one using httpd.conf from 2.2.10 to the one from 2.0.x and identify the source of the problem.  This is the settings in httpd-ssl.conf from Apache 2.2.10. #   to use and second the expiring timeout (in seconds). #SSLSessionCache         "dbm:c:/cache/2210-2/out_nti86/iw-webd/logs/ssl_scache" SSLSessionCache        "shmcb:c:/cache/2210-2/out_nti86/iw-webd/logs/ssl_scache(512000)" SSLSessionCacheTimeout  300  This is the settings in ssl.conf from apache 2.0.x. #SSLSessionCache        none #SSLSessionCache        shmht:logs/ssl_scache(512000) #SSLSessionCache        shmcb:logs/ssl_scache(512000) SSLSessionCache         dbm:logs/ssl_scache  It means that in Apache 2.2.x, shmcb/path/to/cache is used while in Apache 2.0.x, dbm/path/to/cache is used which causes the problem.  In Apache 2.2.10, if I switch to use dbm/path/to/cache, I can reproduce the problem. In Apache 2.0.x, if I switch to use /shm/path/to/path, the problem goes away.  After I found this, I did a search to see if there is any mod_ssl/SSLSessionCache issue which causes the memory memory leak and I did find it at <https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25667>  I am not sure why [bug 25667](show_bug.cgi?id=25667 "RESOLVED LATER - Memory leak in function ssl_scache_dbm_retrieve().") is left open and the solution is just to fix the configuration file and update the doc so that user using apache 2.0.x will be aware of that?  ``` |  |

# Apache: Denial of service — GLSA **200807-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Apache might lead to a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.9** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache:

* Dustin Kirkland reported that the mod\_ssl module can leak memory when
  the client reports support for a compression algorithm (CVE-2008-1678).
* Ryujiro Shibuya reported that the ap\_proxy\_http\_process\_response()
  function in the mod\_proxy module does not limit the number of forwarded
  interim responses (CVE-2008-2364).
* sp3x of SecurityReason reported a Cross-Site Request Forgery
  vulnerability in the balancer-manager in the mod\_proxy\_balancer module
  (CVE-2007-6420).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by connecting to
an Apache httpd, by causing an Apache proxy server to connect to a
malicious server, or by enticing a balancer administrator to connect to
a specially-crafted URL, resulting in a Denial of Service of the Apache
daemon.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.2.9"
```

# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

 **Important**
Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

Hi,

It looks like this bug could be a duplicate of [Bug #224945](/bugs/224945), which actually points to SSL.

Would it be possible for you to retry this use case without using SSL? That would help narrow the issue to libssl, rather than libapache2-mod-auth-pgsql.

Thanks,

:-Dustin

# USN-731-1: Apache vulnerabilities

10 March 2009

Apache vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [apache2](/security/cves?package=apache2) -

## Details

It was discovered that Apache did not sanitize the method specifier header from

an HTTP request when it is returned in an error message, which could result in

browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the

output. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into

viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as

passwords), within the same domain. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and

7.10. ([CVE-2007-6203](/security/CVE-2007-6203))

It was discovered that Apache was vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery

(CSRF) in the mod\_proxy\_balancer balancer manager. If an Apache administrator

were tricked into clicking a link on a specially crafted web page, an attacker

could trigger commands that could modify the balancer manager configuration.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2007-6420](/security/CVE-2007-6420))

It was discovered that Apache had a memory leak when using mod\_ssl with

compression. A remote attacker could exploit this to exhaust server memory,

leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 7.10.

([CVE-2008-1678](/security/CVE-2008-1678))

It was discovered that in certain conditions, Apache did not specify a default

character set when returning certain error messages containing UTF-7 encoded

data, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting

attacks when processing the output. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and

7.10. ([CVE-2008-2168](/security/CVE-2008-2168))

It was discovered that when configured as a proxy server, Apache did not limit

the number of forwarded interim responses. A malicious remote server could send

a large number of interim responses and cause a denial of service via memory

exhaustion. ([CVE-2008-2364](/security/CVE-2008-2364))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ftp did not sanitize wildcard pathnames when

they are returned in directory listings, which could result in browsers becoming

vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output.

([CVE-2008-2939](/security/CVE-2008-2939))

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in PHP 4.4.8

  Description: PHP is updated to version 4.4.9 to address multiple vulnerabilities, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution. Further information is available via the PHP website at <http://www.php.net/> These issues only affect systems running Mac OS X v10.4.x, Mac OS X Server v10.4.x, or Mac OS X Server v10.5.x.

* **Postfix**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3646

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.5

  Impact: A remote attacker may be able to send mail directly to local users

  Description: An issue exists in the Postfix configuration files. For a period of one minute after a local command-line tool sends mail, postfix is accessible from the network. During this time, a remote entity who could connect to the SMTP port may send mail to local users and otherwise use the SMTP protocol. This issue does not cause the system to be an open mail relay. This issue is addressed by modifying the Postfix configuration to prevent SMTP connections from remote machines. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5 and does not affect Mac OS X Server. Credit to Pelle Johansson for reporting this issue.

* **PSNormalizer**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3647

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.5, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Impact: Viewing a maliciously crafted PostScript file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A buffer overflow exists in PSNormalizer's handling of the bounding box comment in PostScript files. Viewing a maliciously crafted PostScript file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue by performing additional validation of PostScript files. Credit: Apple.

* **QuickLook**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-4211

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.5, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Impact: Downloading or viewing a maliciously crafted Microsoft Excel file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A signedness issue exists in QuickLook's handling of columns in Microsoft Excel files may result in an out-of-bounds memory access. Downloading or viewing a maliciously crafted Microsoft Excel file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue by performing additional validation of Microsoft Excel files. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5. Credit: Apple.

* **rlogin**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-4212

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.5, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Impact: Systems that have been manually configured to use rlogin and host.equiv may unexpectedly permit root login

  Description: The manpage for the configuration file hosts.equiv indicates that entries do not apply to root. However, an implementation issue in rlogind causes these entries to also apply to root. This update addresses the issue by properly disallowing rlogin from the root user if the remote system is in hosts.equiv. The rlogin service is not enabled by default in Mac OS X, and must be manually configured in order to be enabled. Credit to Ralf Meyer for reporting this issue.

* **Script Editor**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-4214

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.5, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Impact: A local user may gain the privileges of another user that is using Script Editor

  Description: An insecure file operation issue exists in the Script Editor application when opening application scripting dictionaries. A local user can cause the scripting dictionary to be written to an arbitrary path accessible by the user that is running the application. This update addresses the issue by creating the temporary file in a secure location. Credit: Apple.

* **Single Sign-On**

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.5, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Impact: The sso\_util command now accepts passwords from a file

  Description: The sso\_util command now accepts passwords from a file named in the SSO\_PASSWD\_PATH environment variable. This enables automated scripts to use sso\_util more securely.

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

I'm trying to solve a reproducible memory leak that manifests itself
with SSL + Apache2:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apache2/+bug/224945
Valgrind, plus our own research, points to a possible memory leak in
crypto/comp/c\_zlib.c in libssl0.9.8g.
We see:
struct zlib\_state \*state = -> (struct zlib\_state
\*)OPENSSL\_malloc(sizeof(struct zlib\_state));
allocating the data.
However, it does not seem that a zlib\_stateful\_free\_ex\_data() is called
to free it.
Thanks,

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- yelp
Package yelp was updated to fix a format string bug. (CVE-2008-3533)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0
- apache2
Missing sanity checks of FTP URLs allowed cross site scripting (XSS)
attacks via the mod\_proxy\_ftp module (CVE-2008-2939).
Missing precautions allowed cross site request forgery (CSRF) via
the mod\_proxy\_balancer interface (CVE-2007-6420).
A memory leak in the SSL module could crash apache (CVE-2008-1678)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-11.0, SLES10, SLES9, NLD9, OES, NLPOS9,
SLED
- enscript
This update of enscript fixes buffer overflows in the setfilename
(CVE-2008-3863), process\_file and read\_special\_escape function
(CVE-2008-4306) that can be exploited during file processing.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-11.0, SLES10, SLES9, NLD9, OES, NLPOS9,
SLED
- libcdaudio
A remote attacker can modify a CDDB entry on a CDDB server or just
intercept a connection from the CDDB client to the server to execute
arbitrary code on the client machine.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-11.0

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: apache2

The following came in an email to <email address hidden>. I asked the sender to file a report, but it hasn't happened yet, so I am filing it on his behalf (essentially pasting the email here).

--- EMAIL FROM USER ---

After upgrading our servers from Ubuntu 6.06 to Ubuntu 8.04 we started seeing MASSIVE memory leaks in Apache 2.2 (mpm-worker). Before decreasing MaxRequestsPerChild we actually got kernel panic OOMs so in our view this is a serious DenialOfSerivce vulnerability.

I have spent some time debugging the issue using valgrind and some custom debugging printf's and I have so far concluded that it is related to SSLv3/TLSv1 zlib compression.

How to reproduce the leak:

(1) Set up a SSL-enabled host in Apache2.2. Session cache and the like does not seem to matter, but make sure that the childs run long enough to notice the leak.

(2) Verify that zlib compression is enabled:

$ openssl s\_client -tls1 -connect host:port

(3) Flood the host with compression enabled requests (no SSLv2):

$ ab -n x -c y -f tls1 <https://XXX>

Valgrind indicates that the leak occurs inside crypto/comp/c\_zlib.c in libssl0.9.8g:

static int zlib\_stateful\_init(COMP\_CTX \*ctx)

        {

        int err;

        struct zlib\_state \*state =

-> (struct zlib\_state \*)OPENSSL\_malloc(sizeof(struct

zlib\_state));

My debugging printf's seem to indicate that (in the same file):

static void zlib\_stateful\_finish(COMP\_CTX \*ctx)

is called correctly, but

static void zlib\_stateful\_free\_ex\_data(...)

which is supposed to free the zlib\_state allocation is never called.

The zlib\_stateful\_free\_ex\_data function seems to be called when I use openssl s\_server instead of Apache as the SSL server. I am therefore not completely sure whether the root of this bug is in apache or openssl.

BTW, [bug #186339](/bugs/186339) looks like it is the same issue.

Hi,

I've got the same bug. I've tried disabling mod\_ssl without any success, the memory leak is still happening... Do you have an idea ? Maybe it's not/not only SSL after all ?

I've reproduced this in a Hardy VM with 128MB of memory.

Beyond the default server install, I installed:

apache2-mpm-worker ssl-cert

I enabled ssl with a2enmod.

I created a very simple ssl config for apache and enabled it with a2ensite.

Then, from the VM host, I ran:

time ab -n 100000 -c 20 -f tls1 <https://192.168.122.74:443/>

It locked up the VM. I could see apache2 consuming all virtual memory, and the load pegged at 20.87.

Interestingly, I couldn't shutdown or ctrl-alt-delete the VM to gracefully reset it to a sane state.

The only way to reboot the machine safely is to use the Magic SysRq keys. For instance, I used : AltGr + SysRq + s, AltGr + SysRq + u and AltGr + SysRq + b which syncs the mounted file systems, remounts all the mounted file systems in Read Only mode and finally reboots the computer.

But I still can't prevent Apache from crashing the system even with SSL disabled.

FWIW, I have also reproduced this problem in Gutsy as well, which uses openssl-0.9.8e-5ubuntu3.

However, Dapper-Feisty do not exhibit this problem. Feisty uses openssl-0.9.8c-4ubuntu0.2.

It seems that the regression was introduced sometime between openssl-0.9.8c and 0.9.8e.

Upstream bug filed with Apache:

<https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44975>

They suggested applying this patch:

<http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=654119>

Test packages available in my PPA.

This patch fixes half of the problem. It solves the out-of-memory errors, however, SSL connections are simply dropped when the server is flooded. Note that Feisty's apache2+mod\_ssl is able to handle the flood on both the client and server without errors.

Please disregard my last comment. Those packages did not actually have the patch applied due to some nuances with dpatch in the build. As a result those tests are invalid.

I have since cleanly applied the patch, built test packages, and tested.

These test have succeeded, with 100,000 SSL request being issued and completed successfully, without loss of SSL connection, and without out-of-memory errors.

I'm submitting the attached debdiff as the fix for this issue, and Chuck will be bringing for the SRU. The patch is the one suggested by Apache ( <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=654119> )

Depending on the system load apache with apache-mpm-worker and mod\_ssl enabled will cause ssl to run out of memory and crash. The following patch resolves this issue. It will be needed to be ported to intrepid since it is also vulnerable to this condition.

Steps to reproduce: (TEST CASE)

1. Install apache-mpm-worker and ssl-cert

2. Confgure the SSL cert according to <https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/certificates-and-security.html>.

3. Use the following config in your /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default.

NameVirtualHost \*:443

<VirtualHost \*:443>

 SSLEngine On

 SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ssl.pem

 DocumentRoot /var/www

 <Directory />

  Options Indexes

 </Directory>

</VirtualHost>

4. Run the following command:

ab -n 100000 -c 20 -f tls1 https://<ip address>:443/

You should get OOM errors in a couple of minutes of running the test.

If you have any questions let me know.

chuck
