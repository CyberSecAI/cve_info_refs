Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `thumbnails.php` script of Sabros.us version 1.75. Specifically, the `readfile()` function on line 82 is used without proper sanitization of the input parameter `$img`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application directly uses user-supplied input in the `readfile()` function, which leads to Local File Inclusion. The attacker can manipulate the `img` parameter to include arbitrary files from the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system. This includes sensitive files such as configuration files (e.g., `include/config.php`), system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), or any other readable file on the server. This can lead to disclosure of passwords, database credentials, or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends an HTTP GET request to the `thumbnails.php` script with a crafted `img` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to access the vulnerable server over the network.
*   **Understanding of File Paths:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of the server's file system to specify the correct paths to the target files.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `thumbnails.php` script on line 82: `readfile($img);`
*   The `img` parameter is not sanitized before being used as a file path in the `readfile()` function.
*   Example PoC URLs:
    *   `http://localhost/sabrosus/thumbnails.php?img=include/config.php`
    *   `http://localhost/sabrosus/thumbnails.php?img=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

This exploit allows an attacker to perform LFI and disclose sensitive files.
