  "CVE-2008-1912": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in DivX Player when parsing subtitle files (.srt) with overly long subtitles.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer Overflow",
      "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite the EIP register, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. A denial-of-service (DoS) can also occur.",
       "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by loading a specially crafted .srt file containing an overly long subtitle into DivX Player. This is a local attack vector.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create or have access to a malicious .srt subtitle file and then convince the user to open the file with DivX Player."
    },
    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "The DivX Player fails to properly handle long subtitles in .srt files",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow when parsing .srt subtitle files",
      "Impact of exploitation": "By providing a malformed .srt file, it's possible to overwrite the return address, and execute arbitrary code.",
      "Attack vectors": "By providing a specially crafted .srt file that is loaded by the DivX player.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a malicious srt file and have the user load it into the DivX Player."
