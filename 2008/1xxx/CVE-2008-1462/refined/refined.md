- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database, including user credentials.
- Attack vectors: By manipulating the 'artid' parameter in the 'modules/sections/index.php' URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
