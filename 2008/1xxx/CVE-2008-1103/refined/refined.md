Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-1103:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to "temporary file issues" in Blender. The exact nature is not specified.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure usage of temporary files. The content does not specify how these temporary files are handled insecurely, but the vulnerability is present in the Blender application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The specific impact is "unknown", but could lead to the "remote execution of arbitrary code". It's described as potentially resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is described as "unspecified". However, a Gentoo security advisory mentions that a remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file (.hdr or .blend), and lists this vulnerability in conjunction with CVE-2008-1102 which is about a buffer overflow in a file parsing function. It can be implied that a malicious file may cause this temporary file vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A remote attacker needs to craft a malicious file (likely .hdr or .blend) and trick the user into opening it.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content indicates that the initial fix for CVE-2008-1103 was incomplete, only addressing part of the issue related to `/tmp/quit.blend`. The first complete fix was in `media-gfx/blender-2.48a-r3`.
- There is a patch available from Fedora that was applied, but it only covered part of the issue.
- The SUSE Security Summary Report indicates that they only fixed this problem for future products, as they do not believe Blender is used in security-critical settings.
- This vulnerability is often mentioned in conjunction with CVE-2008-1102.
