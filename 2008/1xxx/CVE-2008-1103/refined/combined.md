| [Description](#c0)  Lars Hartmann    2008-04-23 11:22:16 UTC  ``` Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Blender, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.  The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "imb_loadhdr()" function in source/blender/imbuf/intern/radiance_hdr.c, which can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted Blender (*.blend) file containing a malicious Radiance RGBE image.  Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.  The vulnerability is confirmed in version 2.45. Other versions may also be affected.  Solution: Fixed in the SVN repository. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-04-24 08:23:48 UTC  ``` > Fixed in the SVN repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Blender: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200805-12**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Blender might result in the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/blender** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.43-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.43-r2** |

### Background

Blender is a 3D creation, animation and publishing program.

### Description

Stefan Cornelius (Secunia Research) reported a boundary error within
the imb\_loadhdr() function in in the file
source/blender/imbuf/intern/radiance\_hdr.c when processing RGBE images
(CVE-2008-1102). Multiple vulnerabilities involving insecure usage of
temporary files have also been reported (CVE-2008-1103).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
(.hdr or .blend), possibly resulting in the remote execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Blender users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/blender-2.43-r2"
```

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- licq denial of service
By starting more than 1024 connections against a remote licq client,
attackers could cause licq to crash.
licq was fixed on openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- libpng crash or potential code execution
Specially crafted PNG image files could overwrite arbitrary memory.
Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute arbitrary code,
depending on the application used. (CVE-2008-1382)
Fixed libpng packages were shipped for all SUSE Linux based
distributions.
- Asterisk call without authorization
The opensource PBX asterisk allowed remote attackers to do a call
without prior login via the SIP channel. (CVE-2008-1332)
Asterisk packages were released for SUSE Linux 10.1 and openSUSE 10.2.
- openldap2 denial of service problem
Authenticated users could crash the LDAP server 'slapd' of openldap
via the 'NOOP' command (CVE-2007-6698,CVE-2008-0658)
openldap2 packages have been released for all distributions.
- audit buffer overflow in logging
A bug in the audit\_log\_user\_command() function could lead to a
buffer overflow. No program in openSUSE uses that function. Third
party applications could be affected though (CVE-2008-1628).
Updated audit packages were released for openSUSE 10.3.
- Blender buffer overflow
The rendering program Blender was affected by buffer overflows in
the RGBE header file parsing (CVE-2008-1102) and some temporary
file issues (CVE-2008-1103).
Since we do not think that Blender is not used in security critical
settings with network input data we fixed this problem only for
future products.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
