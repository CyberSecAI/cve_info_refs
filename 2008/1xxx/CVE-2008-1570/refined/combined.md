| [Description](#c0)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-23 16:30:47 UTC  ``` The following has been reported to us by Chris Howells (CC'ed), thanks for that. This bug is confidential for now. Chris, besides security@debian.org did you also try to contact upstream?   Hi,  I believe I have discovered an insecure temporary file vulnerability in policyd-weight, which is in the repositories of Debian etch.  Snippets of code from /usr/sbin/policyd-weight  my $LOCKPATH          = '/tmp/.policyd-weight/';  Then the function create_lockpath chown's lockpath:  sub create_lockpath {     my $who = shift(@_);      if(!( -d $LOCKPATH))     {         mkdir $LOCKPATH or die "$who: error while creating $LOCKPATH: $!";     }      my $tuid = $USER;      if($USER =~ /[^0-9]/)     {         if( !(defined( $tuid = getpwnam($USER) ) ) )         {             mylog(warning=>"User $USER doesn't exist, create it, or set \$USER");         }     }     if( !(chown ($tuid, -1, $LOCKPATH)) )     {         mylog(warning=>"Couldn't chown $LOCKPATH to $USER: $!");     }     if( !(chmod (0700, $LOCKPATH)) )     {         mylog(warning=>"Couldn't set permissions on $LOCKPATH: $!");     } }  I have verified that by doing something like this:  mkdir /home/chris/foo ln -s /home/chris/foo /tmp/.policyd-weight  and starting policyd-weight you can change the ownership or any arbitrary directory around the system - /home/chris/foo got chown'ed to polw:root.  I'm sure you can also play tricks with the creation and deletion of the socket too as they get unlink'ed in a few places, but haven't bothered trying to exploit them as I think this is plenty to be sure that there is a problem. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-23 17:31:05 UTC  ``` from Chris, who currently can't post to this bug cause of bugzilla trouble:  "No, I have not contacted upstream, it doesn't seem to be very actively developed any more. I have however reported it to the FreeBSD security team in addition to you and Debian."  There is a note on the website btw: Policyd-weight is not actively maintained as of 09th Feb 2008. linking to: <http://news.gmane.org/find-root.php?group=gmane.mail.postfix.policyd-weight&article=810> ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Andrej Kacian (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-24 02:54:01 UTC  ``` Last relevant e-mails on upstream mailinglist mention new developers being added to policyd-weight sf.net project. Currently there are four, two of them with admin rights (including old maintainer, who is thought to be inactive).  I have sent them an e-mail with Chris' report (Chris was also CCd). Let's see if they respond.  Thanks for the report, Chris! ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Andrej Kacian (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-27 09:15:56 UTC  ``` Old maintainer responded on policyd-weight mailing list, releasing a new version (0.1.14.15), which should have this issue fixed. I just committed it to portage. Can someone please verify if the fix is working? I have to head to work now and will not be able to test until tonight.  Thanks! ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Andrej Kacian (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-27 22:53:35 UTC  ``` OK, looks like latest version is no good - I was still able to change ownership of /root to polw:root. I reported this upstream, let's wait for them. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-28 00:20:19 UTC  ``` The patch introduces a symlink check, but I do not see how that is safe to race attacks. Looking at the "create_lockpath" function, it should be possible for an attacker to previously create the $LOCKPATH directory, and replace it (after the symlink check) by a symlink.  The socket and data files should be moved to /var/run The website also states [1]: "Workaround: change $LOCKPATH from /tmp/.policyd-weight to /var/run/.policyd-weight. You need to manually kill policyd-weight and to remove the old directory."  ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-28 00:21:01 UTC  ``` public via <http://www.us.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1531> ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Thijs Kinkhorst    2008-03-28 09:15:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=214403#c6)) > public via <http://www.us.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1531>  Just to note that this was already publicised on the upstream mailinglist last Sunday, the DSA itself did not make it public. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Robert Felber    2008-03-28 13:23:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=214403#c5)) > The patch introduces a symlink check, but I do not see how that is safe to race > attacks.

I'd like to change the working directory after handling of such /tmp issues has been sorted out; would the following patch suffice?:  --- old/policyd-weight      Fri Mar 28 10:06:46 2008 +++ new/policyd-weight      Fri Mar 28 14:08:30 2008 @@ -23,9 +23,9 @@  # see <http://spf.pobox.com/>  #  # AUTHOR:  r.felber@ek-muc.de -# DATE:    Fri Mar 28 10:08:42 CET 2008 +# DATE:    Fri Mar 28 14:08:20 CET 2008  # NAME:    policyd-weight -# VERSION: 0.1.14 beta-16 +# VERSION: 0.1.14 beta-17  # URL:     <http://www.policyd-weight.org/>   @@ -65,6 +65,7 @@  # begin  use strict;  use Fcntl; +use File::Spec;  use Sys::Syslog qw(:DEFAULT setlogsock);  use Net::DNS;  use Net::DNS::Packet qw(dn_expand); @@ -78,7 +79,7 @@   use vars qw($csock $s $tcp_socket $sock $new_sock $old_mtime);  -our $VERSION   = "0.1.14 beta-16"; +our $VERSION   = "0.1.14 beta-17";  our $CVERSION  = 5;                 # cache interface version  our $CMD_DEBUG = 0;                 # -d switch  our $KILL;                          # -k switch @@ -3614,6 +3615,9 @@  }   + + +  #  # usage: check_symlnk($caller, @files)  # @@ -3625,17 +3629,53 @@      for ( @_ )      {  -        # strip trailing '/' -        # perl and test(1) ignore the request for -l/-L and -        # do a lstat with S_IFDIR (added in 0.1.14 beta-16) -        s/\/+$//; +        my $file = File::Spec->canonpath($_); + +        my @stat = lstat( $file );  -        if ( -l $_ ) +        if(! -e _)          { -            fatal_exit("$who: $_ is a symbolic link.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# policyd-weight: Insecure temporary file creation — GLSA **200804-11**

policyd-weight uses temporary files in an insecure manner, allowing for a
symlink attack.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-filter/policyd-weight** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.1.14.17** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.1.14.17** |

### Background

policyd-weight is a Perl policy daemon for the Postfix MTA intended to
eliminate forged envelope senders and HELOs.

### Description

Chris Howells reported that policyd-weight creates and uses the
"/tmp/.policyd-weight/" directory in an insecure manner.

### Impact

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to delete arbitrary
files or change the ownership to the "polw" user via symlink attacks.

### Workaround

Set "*$LOCKPATH = '/var/run/policyd-weight/'*" manually in
"/etc/policyd-weight.conf".

### Resolution

All policyd-weight users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-filter/policyd-weight-0.1.14.17"
```

This version changes the default path for sockets to
"/var/run/policyd-weight", which is only writable by a privileged user.
Users need to restart policyd-weight immediately after the upgrade due
to this change.
