{
  "CVE-2008-1188": {
    "Description": "The Java Web Start in Sun Java Runtime is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow in the `useEncodingDecl()` function. When parsing an XML header, an overly long charset name is read into a static buffer, leading to an exploitable condition.",
    "Root cause": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing the charset attribute of an XML header in a JNLP file.",
     "Weaknesses": [
       "CWE-121"
      ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations by exploiting the stack-based buffer overflow.",
    "Attack vectors": "Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by enticing users to download and open a specially crafted malicious JNLP file, typically hosted on a malicious webpage.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website that offers the specially crafted JNLP file. The user interaction is also a factor as they have to visit the page and initiate the download/execution. No special network access is needed."
