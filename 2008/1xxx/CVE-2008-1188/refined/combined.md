# Advisory Details

March 12th, 2008
## Java Web Start encoding Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

### ZDI-08-010ZDI-CAN-235

| CVE ID | [CVE-2008-1188](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1188) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Sun Microsystems](http://www.sun.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Java Runtime |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['5633']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Sun Java Web Start. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.  The specific flaw exists in the useEncodingDecl() function used while parsing the xml header character encoding attribute. When a user downloads a malicious JNLP file, the charset value is read into a static buffer. If an overly charset name in the xml header is included, a stack based buffer overflow occurs, resulting in an exploitable condition. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Notes: These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely only if the
attacker has access to the service console network.
Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the
service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see
[http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](/resources/techresources/726) for more
information on VMware security best practices.

The currently installed versions of Tomcat and JRE depend
on your patch deployment history.

# Advisory Details

March 12th, 2008
## Java Web Start tempbuff Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

### ZDI-08-009ZDI-CAN-234

| CVE ID | [CVE-2008-1188](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1188) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Sun Microsystems](http://www.sun.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Java Runtime |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['5622']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Sun Java Web Start. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.  The specific flaw exists in the useEncodingDecl() function used while checking xml based JNLP files for UTF8 characters. When a user downloads a malicious JNLP file, the data immediately preceding the opening of the xml tag is read into a static buffer. If an overly long key name in the xml header is included, a stack based buffer overflow occurs, resulting in an exploitable condition. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-66-233323-1> |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# JRockit: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200804-28**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in BEA JRockit.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.14** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.4.2.16**>= **1.5.0.14** |

### Background

JRockit is BEA WebLogic's J2SE Development Kit.

### Description

Because of sharing the same codebase, JRockit is affected by the
vulnerabilities mentioned in GLSA 200804-20.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet
on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute
arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security
restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker
could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and
read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in
the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of
Service via multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All JRockit 1.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin-1.4.2.16"
```

All JRockit 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin-1.5.0.14"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
IBM Java 1.4.2 was updated to SR10 and IBM Java 1.5.0 was updated to
SR7 to fix various security issues:
- CVE-2008-1196: A buffer overflow vulnerability in Java Web Start
may allow an untrusted Java Web Start application that is downloaded
from a website to elevate its privileges. For example, an untrusted
Java Web Start application may grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or execute local applications that are accessible
to the user running the untrusted application.
- CVE-2008-1195: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment may
allow JavaScript(TM) code that is downloaded by a browser to make
connections to network services on the system that the browser runs
on, through Java APIs, This may allow files (that are accessible
through these network services) or vulnerabilities (that exist on
these network services) which are not otherwise normally accessible
to be accessed or exploited.
- CVE-2008-1192: A vulnerability in the Java Plug-in may an untrusted
applet to bypass same origin policy and leverage this flaw to
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
- CVE-2008-1190: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow an
untrusted Java Web Start application to elevate its privileges. For
example, an application may grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or execute local applications that are accessible
to the user running the untrusted application.
- CVE-2008-1189: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment may allow an untrusted applet or application to elevate
its privileges. For example, an applet may grant itself permissions
to read and write local files or execute local applications that
are accessible to the user running the untrusted applet.
- CVE-2008-1187: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
with parsing XML data may allow an untrusted applet or application
to elevate its privileges. For example, an applet may read certain
URL resources (such as some files and web pages).
- CVE-2007-5232: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with applet caching may allow an untrusted applet that is
downloaded from a malicious website to make network connections to
network services on machines other than the one that the applet was
downloaded from. This may allow network resources (such as web pages)
and vulnerabilities (that exist on these network services) which
are not otherwise normally accessible to be accessed or exploited.
- CVE-2007-5274: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
may allow malicious Javascript code that is downloaded by a browser
from a malicious website to make network connections, through Java
APIs, to network services on machines other than the one that the
Javascript code was downloaded from. This may allow network resources
(such as web pages) and vulnerabilities (that exist on these network
services) which are not otherwise normally accessible to be accessed
or exploited.
- CVE-2007-5273: A second vulnerability in the JRE may allow an
untrusted applet that is downloaded from a malicious website through
a web proxy to make network connections to network services on
machines other than the one that the applet was downloaded from. This
may allow network resources (such as web pages) and vulnerabilities
(that exist on these network services) which are not otherwise
normally accessible to be accessed or exploited.
- CVE-2007-5236: An untrusted Java Web Start application may
write arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running
the application.
- CVE-2007-5238: Three separate vulnerabilities may allow an untrusted
Java Web Start application to determine the location of the Java
Web Start cache.
- CVE-2007-5239: An untrusted Java Web Start application or Java
applet may move or copy arbitrary files by requesting the user of
the application or applet to drag and drop a file from the Java
Web Start application or Java applet window.
- CVE-2007-5240: An untrusted applet may display an over-sized window
so that the applet warning banner is not visible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
- CVE-2007-4381: A vulnerability in the font parsing code in the
Java Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet to elevate
its privileges. For example, an applet may grant itself permissions
to read and write local files or execute local applications that
are accessible to the user running the untrusted applet.
- CVE-2007-3698: The Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) that is
included in various releases of the Java Runtime Environment does not
correctly process SSL/TLS handshake requests. This vulnerability may
be exploited to create a Denial of Service (DoS) condition to the
system as a whole on a server that listens for SSL/TLS connections
using JSSE for SSL/TLS support.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart running instances of IBM Java.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

# IBM JDK/JRE: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200806-11**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in IBM Java Development Kit (JDK)
and Java Runtime Environment (JRE), resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.7**revision >= **1.4.2.11** |

| Package | **dev-java/ibm-jre-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.7**revision >= **1.4.2.11** |

### Background

The IBM Java Development Kit (JDK) and the IBM Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the IBM Java platform.

### Description

Because of sharing the same codebase, IBM JDK and JRE are affected by
the vulnerabilities mentioned in GLSA 200804-20.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet
on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute
arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security
restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker
could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and
read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in
the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of
Service via multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All IBM JDK 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin-1.5.0.7"
```

All IBM JDK 1.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin-1.4.2.11"
```

All IBM JRE 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jre-bin-1.5.0.7"
```

All IBM JRE 1.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jre-bin-1.4.2.11"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  not properly enforce the same origin policy (CVE-2008-1192).
* Chris Evans of the Google Security Team discovered multiple
  unspecified vulnerabilities within the Java Runtime Environment Image
  Parsing Library (CVE-2008-1193, CVE-2008-1194).
* Gregory Fleischer reported that web content fetched via the "jar:"
  protocol was not subject to network access restrictions
  (CVE-2008-1195).
* Chris Evans and Johannes Henkel of the Google Security Team
  reported that the XML parsing code retrieves external entities even
  when that feature is disabled (CVE-2008-0628).
* Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities might allow for escalation of
  privileges (CVE-2008-0657).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet
on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute
arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security
restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker
could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and
read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in
the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of
Service via multiple vectors.
