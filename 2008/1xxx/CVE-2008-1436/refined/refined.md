{
  "CVE-2008-1436": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is due to the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) transaction facility allowing the NetworkService token to be obtained and used when making an RPC call. This allows a process with SeImpersonatePrivilege to elevate its privileges to NetworkService.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) transaction facility allows the NetworkService token to be obtained and used when making an RPC call.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper token handling by MSDTC",
        "Lack of proper service isolation"
      ],
      "impact": "Elevation of privilege, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with NetworkService privileges, potentially leading to complete control over the affected system. This can allow the attacker to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker must be able to run code on the local machine. They exploit this vulnerability through a specially crafted application that calls into the MSDTC service.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the local machine. Additionally, the attacker needs to have the `SeImpersonatePrivilege` to exploit the vulnerability.",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability allows a process that is not running under the NetworkService account, but that has the `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, to elevate its privilege to NetworkService. The vulnerability also allows a process to obtain the LocalSystem token from other vulnerable services."
