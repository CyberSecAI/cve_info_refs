PSK Cracking using IKE Aggressive Mode
Michael Thumann, mthumann@ernw.de
Enno Rey, erey@ernw.de

1. Basics:

IKE Aggressive Mode:

Cookie_I

SA_I+KE_I+Nonce_I+ID_I

Cookie_R

SA_R+KE_R+Nonce_R+ID_R+Hash_R

Initiator

Hash_I

Responder

In IKE Aggressive mode the authentication hash based on a preshared key (PSK) is
transmitted as response to the initial packet of a vpn client that wants to establish an
IPSec Tunnel (Hash_R). This hash is not encrypted. It's possible to capture these
packets using a sniffer, for example tcpdump and start dictionary or brute force attack
against this hash to recover the PSK. With IKECrack (http://ikecrack.sourceforge.net)
is a tool available to do this job.

This attack only works in IKE aggressive mode because in IKE Main Mode the hash
is already encrypted. Based on this facts IKE aggressive mode is not very secure.
This is not new.

Theory:
To capture and crack the PSK we need IKE aggressive mode and we must be able
to capture the traffic from the wire. Also the IP Address of the vpn client must be
acceptable by the vpn gateway.

§

§

If the attacking client tries to establish the IPSec Tunnel we are able to capture
the traffic and the authentication hash.

If the vpn gateway can be forced to use aggressive mode the hash is not
encrypted. With PGPNet it’s possible to configure the vpn client to force
aggressive mode. VPN gateways like cisco routers change automatically to
aggressive mode, if the vpn client requests that.

§  There’s no need to get the IPSec Tunnel established to capture the authentication

hash from the gateway in aggressive mode because the needed hash is
transmitted in the first response packet of the vpn gateway.

§  Traveling user connect from everywhere in the internet, so very often vpn

gateways are configured to accept any IP Address. On cisco routers this is called
dynamic crypto map.

If we combine these point it must be able to attack vpn gateways (tested with Cisco
routers and Checkpoint Firewall-1 NG) that allow vpn connections from any IP
Address and which are based on preshared keys.

Attack Client configuration:

We will use PGPNet as attack client, because PGPNet has many Options to
configure IKE and IPSec parameters.

We can configure PGPNet to use aggressive mode and force the cisco router to use
aggressive mode too. This attack only works in aggressive mode.

The PSK entered in PGPNet doesn’t matter, so you can enter whatever you want.

The next Step is to configure IKE and IPSec parameters like lifetimes:

And of course the parameters for the IKE and IPSec proposals:

Ok, now  we can test our configuration and it will not work, because we don’t know
the preshared key.

Taking a look into the log shows that the authentication has failed:

The Attack:

We are ready to start our attack.
At first windump (or tcpdump on the *nix plattform) must be started with the following
syntax:

Use windump 3.6.2 because the newer version 3.8 doesn’t write the ouput file in the
right way

After starting the capturing process press again the CONNECT Button in PGPNet
and PGPNet tries to establish the VPN connection with the same authentication
error. Now stop windump.

The next step ist to start the cracking tool IKECrack (http://ikecrack.sourceforge.net)
with.the following syntax:

perl ikecrack-snarf-1.00.pl 10.1.1.85.500

10.1.1.85 is the IP Address of the attacking client and 500 is the UDP Port Number
for ISAKMP.

The tool will extract all needed values to start the cracking process, it supports
dictionary and brute force attack.

Here is a screenshot of IKECrack doing its job:

Finally the password is recovered.

Now we can enter the discovered preshared key in our PGPNet configuration ...

... and try the connection again:

Another look in the log shows that all needed SAs have been created and we have
access:

That’s it ;-).

3. Conclusion

The described attack puts all VPNs at risk that uses preshared keys for
authentication and accepts VPN connections from anywhere like access for traveling
users.

Another need for a successful attack is that the VPN Gateway switches automatically
to aggressive mode when the attack clients requests aggressive mode or is
configured to support it.

4. Possible Solutions:

§  Don’t use preshared keys for authentication even with routers.

§  Don’t allow dynamic IP Addresses in VPNs and don’t use dynamic crypto maps.

§  Disable aggressive mode if it’s supported (like Checkpoint Firewall-1).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=435274#c0)  Aleksander Adamowski    2008-02-28 14:17:38 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The default IPSec ifup script (/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-ipsec) initializes the racoon configuration to use aggressive IKE mode, then fallback to main IKE mode if that fails:  ... remote $DST {   exchange_mode aggressive, main; ...  Due to widely known attacks, the aggressive mode should be only used when public key authentication is in use. In practice, most administrators use IPSec with PSK authentication, which combined with aggressive mode leads to aforementioned vulnerability.  See this whitepaper for more information: <http://www.netsc.ch/IMG/pdf/TargetingIKE_en.pdf>  The exchange_mode should be changed to "main" only or, for a low-security fallback, to "main, aggressive" (in the opposite order than currently).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=435274#c1)  Josh Bressers    2008-02-28 16:19:30 UTC  ``` Hi Aleksander,  Can you elaborate on this paper?  I'm having a bit of a rough time understanding exactly what the problem is here.  My understanding from reading the paper is that  the attack described could allow a remote attacker to determine information about the VPN gateway.  I don't think I'm understanding the problem properly, can you help explain this in a manner I can grasp?  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=435274#c2)  Aleksander Adamowski    2008-02-29 12:03:15 UTC  ``` Sorry, the paper I've linked to may not be as readable as the original paper by Michael Thumann and Enno Rey which you can read over here:  <http://www.ernw.de/download/pskattack.pdf>  In short, the PSK hash in Aggressive mode is sent unencrypted over the network, and this condition greatly eases cracking (brute force/dictionary) attacks on the PSK.  Quoting the Thumann/Rey paper:  "In IKE Aggressive mode the authentication hash based on a preshared key (PSK) is transmitted as response to the initial packet of a vpn client that wants to establish an IPSec Tunnel (Hash_R). This hash is not encrypted. It's possible to capture these packets using a sniffer, for example tcpdump and start dictionary or brute force attack against this hash to recover the PSK. With IKECrack (<http://ikecrack.sourceforge.net>) is a tool available to do this job. This attack only works in IKE aggressive mode because in IKE Main Mode the hash is already encrypted. Based on this facts IKE aggressive mode is not very secure."   That's the theory, in practice you can try the attack yourself using IKECrack.   Apart from security problems, this default configuration also causes interoperability problems (which in fact have led me to this investigation).  When you try to setup an IPSec transport mode association between Red Hat (tested on RHEL4) and Windows XP, the associations cannot be successfully initiated from the Red Hat side.  When Windows initiates the association, it's set up properly.  When analyzing network traffic dump one can clearly see that Red Hat offers key exchange using ISAKMP Aggressive mode. Windows simply ignores this request and negotiation eventually times out on Red Hat side.  This is both combination of improper behaviour on Windows side (it rightfully doesn't accept the Aggressive mode because it's insecure, but it should reply indicating that the proposed mode of key exchange isn't acceptable - instead it remains silent) and on Red Hat side (it should offer the more secure "main" mode first).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=435274#c4)  Steve Conklin    2008-02-29 17:30:11 UTC  ``` I concur with the reporter. Agressive mode has vulnerabilities and should not be the default. This shouldn't impact any administrators, (at least not in homogeneous Red Hat networks) and if it does, they will be the ones who are knowledgable enough to set up their own configurations anyway.  It's possible that this will cause other interoperability problems with other vendors, but I have no way of predicting what those may be. I think the risk is low.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=435274#c5)  Josh Bressers    2008-03-06 18:58:03 UTC  ``` Given that this flaw is the result of a bad configuration option, I'm going to request a CVE id for this issue and we shall see about getting it fixed in a future security update.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=435274#c6)  Josh Bressers    2008-03-06 19:09:10 UTC  ``` Steve,  Does this only affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, or are others affected as well?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=435274#c7)  Bill Nottingham    2008-03-06 19:13:08 UTC  ``` It's the same in 3 and 4.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=435274#c8)  Josh Bressers    2008-03-06 20:02:58 UTC  ``` I'm moving this bug to the Security Response product for proper tracking as a security issue.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=435274#c11)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-26 16:10:30 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Aleksander Adamowski for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=435274#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-21 03:01:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0312 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0312.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
