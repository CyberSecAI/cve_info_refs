Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4144

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection flaw in the `cid` parameter within the `index.php` script of ACG-ScriptShop. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Data Exposure: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database. This is demonstrated in the exploit examples where usernames and passwords are extracted.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP GET request: The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` script with a malicious `cid` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Remote attacker: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, requiring no special access other than being able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit examples demonstrate how to use the `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique to extract data.  Specifically, the attacker injects SQL code in the `cid` parameter to perform `union select` queries, retrieving data from tables such as `coders`, `resellers`, and `users`. The exploit uses `concat_ws(0x3a,username,password)` to combine the username and password columns with a colon separator.

**Example exploits**

```
www.[target].com/Script/index.php?menu=showcat&cid=-2+union+select+1,concat_ws(0x3a,username,password),3+from+coders--
```

```
www.[target].com/Script/index.php?menu=showcat&cid=-2+union+select+1,concat_ws(0x3a,username,password),3+from+resellers--
```

```
www.[target].com/Script/index.php?menu=showcat&cid=-2+union+select+1,concat_ws(0x3a,username,upass),3+from+users--
```

These exploits manipulate the `cid` parameter to bypass the original query and inject their own SQL query using a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data.

**Additional Information:**
The exploit database entry also provides the vulnerable application details, vendor links, and search engine "dorks" to find affected installations.
