Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-4335:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `apa_album_ID` parameter in the `album.php` script of Atomic Photo Album 1.1.0pre4 is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `apa_album_ID` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This can be exploited in two ways:
    *   **Standard SQL Injection:** Allows direct querying of the database by injecting SQL queries into the vulnerable parameter.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** Allows retrieval of data by observing changes in the application's response based on injected SQL conditions, without direct error messages.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `apa_album_ID` parameter is also vulnerable to XSS, allowing the attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers can retrieve sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and potentially other confidential information.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data stored in the database, potentially disrupting the application or affecting its users.
*   **XSS:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could steal user session cookies, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites or inject code that downloads malware onto their systems.
    *   **Defacement:** Attackers could alter the appearance or content of the web page, causing reputational damage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can modify the `apa_album_ID` parameter value in the URL of `album.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **No authentication required:** The exploits can be performed without any prior authentication or authorization.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The identified vulnerabilities affect Atomic Photo Album version 1.1.0pre4.
*   The provided exploit code (from exploit-db) demonstrates how to perform blind SQL injection to extract usernames and passwords.
*   The exploit details also include a Google dork to find instances of the vulnerable application,
    * `intext:"Powered by Atomic Photo Album 1.1.0pre4"`.
*   The XSS vulnerability is demonstrated with a simple `alert(1337)` payload.
