Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation and sanitization within the PHPdaily application. Specifically:

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `id` and `prev` parameters in several PHP files (`add_postit.php`, `delete.php`, `prest_detail.php`, `mod_prest_date.php`). This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database.
*   **Local File Download (LFD):** The `download_file.php` script uses the `fichierwe` parameter without sufficient sanitization, enabling attackers to download arbitrary local files from the server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `add_prest_date.php` script does not sanitize the `date` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject client-side JavaScript code that will be executed by the victim's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   SQL Injection
*   Local File Download
*   Cross-Site Scripting

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Exploitation can allow attackers to:
    *   Retrieve sensitive database information.
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain further control of the application and server.
*   **Local File Download:** Exploitation can allow attackers to:
    *   Download sensitive application files, potentially including database configuration details.
    *   Download operating system files (if the server configuration permits).
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Exploitation can allow attackers to:
    *   Execute malicious JavaScript within the victim's browser.
    *   Potentially steal cookies, hijack user sessions, and redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Malicious SQL queries injected via GET requests through vulnerable parameters like `id` and `prev`.
*   **Local File Download:** Crafted GET requests to `download_file.php` with manipulated `fichierwe` parameter values to access files outside of the web root.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Crafted GET requests to `add_prest_date.php` with malicious JavaScript injected in the `date` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No prior authentication is required for the described exploits, allowing an unauthenticated user to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker needs to know the vulnerable script names and their parameters to craft the exploit.

**Additional Details:**

*   The application is PHPdaily.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by 0xFFFFFF.
*   The vulnerability was published on October 23, 2008.
*   The identified vulnerabilities are classified as High risk.

In summary, the provided content indicates multiple vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker to achieve significant impact.

**CWE:** CWE-22 (Path Traversal) is referenced and related to the Local File Download vulnerability.
