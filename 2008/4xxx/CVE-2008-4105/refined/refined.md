Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2008-4105:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a "JRequest Variable Injection" flaw within the Joomla core. This flaw arises from how the application handles user-supplied input when building a request.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Variable Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject variables into the application through manipulated requests. This means an attacker can control or influence certain parameters that are normally set internally by the application.

**Impact:**
- By injecting arbitrary variables, an attacker could potentially manipulate the application's behavior. The specific impact of the injection will vary based on how and where the injected variable is used. It could lead to things like:
    - Bypassing security checks
    - Modifying data
    - Causing unexpected or erroneous behavior
    - Potentially escalating to more severe issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:**  The attack vector involves sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the Joomla application. This can be done via a web browser or other tools that allow for sending modified HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** An attacker only needs remote access to the Joomla application to exploit this vulnerability, implying that it is remotely exploitable.
- **No Authentication Required**: There is no indication that the attacker needs prior authentication or any special privileges.

**Additional details from the provided resources:**

*   The vulnerability is related to a core issue within the JRequest component of Joomla
*   This is one of four vulnerabilities patched in Joomla 1.5.7. The others are related to random number generation, email spam and redirect spam, and are assigned CVE-2008-4102, CVE-2008-4103 and CVE-2008-4104 respectively.
*   The specific Joomla advisory for this vulnerability is located at: http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/271-20080901-core-jrequest-variable-injection.html

In summary, CVE-2008-4105 describes a remotely exploitable variable injection vulnerability in Joomla that could allow an attacker to manipulate application behavior by injecting crafted variables via HTTP requests.
