    {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `leggi.php` script in geccBBlite 2.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `id` parameter.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection (CWE-89). The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data extraction, modification, or deletion. In this specific exploit, the attacker uses `load_file()` to read arbitrary files from the server's file system.",
        "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP GET request to the `leggi.php` script using a crafted `id` parameter.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, no authentication is required. The application must be accessible remotely."
