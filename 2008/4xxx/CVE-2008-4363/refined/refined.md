  "CVE-2008-4363": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is present in DESlock+ versions prior to 3.2.7, specifically within the DLMFENC.sys driver (version 1.0.0.28). The vulnerability is a local kernel Denial of Service (DoS) triggered by a call to `ProbeForRead` with a user-controlled address, which should have been `ProbeForWrite`. This incorrect use leads to a memory overwrite. The proof of concept (PoC) code shows how to trigger the vulnerability using a crafted IOCTL request.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is the incorrect usage of the `ProbeForRead` function where `ProbeForWrite` should have been used, allowing a user-controlled address to be overwritten.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect usage of `ProbeForRead` instead of `ProbeForWrite`."
    ],
    "impact": "Local Kernel Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access is required."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires the ability to execute code locally to send a crafted IOCTL to the device driver."
