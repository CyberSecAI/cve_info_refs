Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-4033:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) handles transfer-encoding headers in HTTP requests. Specifically, MSXML allows clients to set certain HTTP request fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of HTTP Headers:** MSXML does not properly sanitize or validate client-provided HTTP request fields, particularly transfer-encoding headers. This lack of control enables session state corruption.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability can be exploited to expose sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to read data from a Web page in another domain within Internet Explorer.
*   **Cross-Domain Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal information meant to be restricted to a specific domain.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker hosts a malicious website containing specially crafted content designed to exploit the vulnerability when accessed via Internet Explorer.
*   **Compromised Websites:**  Legitimate websites that have been compromised could host the malicious content.
*  **User-provided Content:** Websites that host user-provided content or advertisements could also be leveraged.
*   **HTML Email:** Specially crafted HTML emails could trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers would need to convince users to visit the malicious website (e.g. via links in emails, IM messages or compromised ads).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Content:** The attacker needs to host a webpage with malicious code or inject it into another site
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting the malicious page (e.g. by using a phishing email or a compromised website)
*   **No Forced Action:** The attack relies on the user visiting the malicious website or opening the malicious email, the attacker cannot force this action.
*   **Target User Action:** The victim must use Internet Explorer to browse the malicious webpage or view the crafted HTML email for the exploit to trigger.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided document also references MSXML Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE-2007-0099) and MSXML DTD Cross-Domain Scripting Vulnerability (CVE-2008-4029), which are addressed by the same security update.
*   The document lists workarounds like disabling Active Scripting, setting the security zone to "High", and adding trusted sites to Internet Explorer's trusted sites zone.
*   The document states that the update mitigates the vulnerability by no longer allowing clients to set certain HTTP request fields.
*   The advisory was initially made via responsible disclosure, and there were no known reports of exploitation in the wild at the time of the bulletin's publication.
