That reminds me, I recently noticed valgrind also does this.

$ printf -- "--db-command=/usr/bin/id\n--db-attach=yes\n" > /tmp/.valgrindrc

Etc.

Thanks, Tavis.

# Valgrind: Untrusted search path — GLSA **200902-03**

An untrusted search path vulnerability in Valgrind might result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-util/valgrind** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.4.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.4.0** |

### Background

Valgrind is an open-source memory debugger.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy reported that Valgrind loads a .valgrindrc file in the
current working directory, executing commands specified there.

### Impact

A local attacker could prepare a specially crafted .valgrindrc file and
entice a user to run Valgrind from the directory containing that file,
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Valgrind.

### Workaround

Do not run "valgrind" from untrusted working directories.

### Resolution

All Valgrind users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/valgrind-3.4.0"
```
### References

* [CVE-2008-4865](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4865)

**Release date**

February 12, 2009

**Latest revision**

Correct, I should have listed that before as separate case for gdb /
valgrind.  But is there any good way to protect against this without
crippling this feature completely?

That should be covered by previously mentioned 2).

Correct, again... CVE-2005-1705
  <http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88398>

Note to self: Do more research before trying to teach old dog ^W^W
Tavis some new ^W really really old tricks... ;)

I'll shut up now...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- imlib2
A security problem was fixed in imlib2 where loading a specific XPM
file could corrupt memory. (CVE-2008-5187)
Affected products: SLED 10 SP2, SLE SDK 10 (updates for other products
were already released)
- valgrind
valgrind reads a file .valgrindrc in the current directory.
Therefore local users could place such a file a world writable
directory such as /tmp and influence other users' valgrind when it's
executed there (CVE-2008-4865).
Affected products: SLES9/SDK (updates for other products were already
released)
- kvm
Rogue VNC clients could make the built in VNC server of kvm run into
an infinite loop (CVE-2008-2382)
An off-by-one bug limited the length of VNC passwords to seven
instead of eight (CVE-2008-5714)
Virtualized guests could potentially execute code on the host by
triggering a buffer overflow in the network emulation code via large
ethernet frames (CVE-2007-5729)
Virtualized guests could potentially execute code on the host by
triggering a heap based buffer overflow in the Cirrus Graphics card
emulation (CVE-2007-1320).
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- cups
Previous updates for the PNG and HPGL filters were incomplete and
are corrected now (CVE-2008-3641, CVE-2008-5286).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3, 11.0, SLE10-SP2, SLES9
- lynx
This update of lynx fixes two security bugs:
- untrusted search path allows execution of arbitrary commands via
.mailcap or mime.types file (CVE-2006-7234)
- when advanced mode is enabled and lynx is used as URL handler, remote
attackers can execute arbitrary commands (CVE-2008-4690)
Affected products: NLD 9 SDK, SLE SDK 10 SP2, SLES SDK 9 (updates for
other products were already released)
- xterm
XTerm evaluated various ANSI Escape sequences so that command execution
was possible if an attacker could pipe raw data to an xterm.
(CVE-2008-2383)
(It is usually not recommended to display raw data on an xterm.)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLE10-SP2, (SLES9 packages will
be released within this week)

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Well obviously. The attack would be convincing someone to debug an
application with a testcase provided in a tarball, or to debug something
in a specific directory.

If you just dumped one in /tmp on a system I use and waited a few weeks,
there's a strong possibility you would pwn me.

Of course, guess who reported that ;-) (me).

The patch to make those checks was provided by me. I'm suggesting
valgrind should do the same thing.

Thanks, Tavis.

Well, I'd say the situation with valgrind is slightly different.  For
lynx, there seem to be 2 obvious attack vectors:

1) User downloads tarball with bunch of htmls, with bundled
malicious .mailcap file.  When user cds to the directory and runs lynx,
he's owned.

2) Local social engineering attack - local attacker convinces victim to
run lynx in some specially crafted local directory.

For valgrind, 1) does not seem to make much sense (or is lot less
likely), as if you valgrind random binary downloaded form the net,
you're already running attacker's code.

Few other differences:
- valgrind behavior is known and well documented
<http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core.html#manual-core.defopts>
(lynx.cfg file comments suggested, that mailcap file is read from
user's home directory, no mention of CWD)

- valgrind's behavior seems more useful and used in the wild, so not
easily changeable

- you can suppress reading .valgrindrc files using
--command-line-only=yes , but this option does not seem to be very well
documented in commonly shipped man pages or --help output.
There seem to be some man page versions that mention this option:
<http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/valgrind1.html>

Actually, gdb may be another target with its handling of .gdbinit:

   echo 'shell /usr/bin/id' > .gdbinit ; gdb

(gdb seems to have some checks in place though and refuses to open files
that world-writable or not owned by the user)
