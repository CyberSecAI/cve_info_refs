How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Gallery 2.2.6 Security Fix Release

Submitted by valiant on Thu, 2008-09-18 07:25

**Gallery 2.2.6** is now available for [download](http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2%3ADownload#Packages). This release fixes critical security issues, no new features have been added. Users of all previous Gallery 2 versions are **strongly encouraged** to upgrade to version 2.2.6 as soon as possible! The Gallery team thanks Alex Ustinov and Hanno Boeck for reporting the security issues through the right channels and will reward them with a well deserved [security bounty](http://codex.gallery2.org/Bounties).

Since 2.2.6 is a security release, it shares the same installation requirements as 2.2.5. If you haven't upgraded to 2.2.x yet, please review the [Gallery 2.2 release notes](http://gallery.menalto.com/gallery_2.2_released) for highlights of changes and the requirements. Read on for more details and upgrade instructions.

## Upgrading Instructions

Upgrading is quick and easy

* Users of Gallery 2.1 or earlier should review release notes for requirement changes and update all application files.
* Users of Gallery 2.2 or later (2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4 or 2.2.5) can use an update file to upgrade specific core files and then upgrade the affected modules via [Downloadable Plugins](http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2%3AGet_More_Plugins).

Regardless of your Gallery's version, review the [upgrading instructions](http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2%3AUpgrading) for complete details.

## Security Vulnerabilities

Gallery 2.2.6 addresses the following security vulnerabilities:

* Arbitrary file disclosure through archive upload module - Users with "add item" permission could retrieve any file on the server that is owned by the web server account. The problem is caused by incorrect handling of ZIP archives that contain symbolic links.

  The Gallery team would like to thank Alex Ustinov for bringing this issue to our attention.
* Insecure cookies over HTTPS - When accessing Gallery over HTTPS, cookies were missing the "secure" flag, leaving the connection vulnerable to cookie sniffing attacks.

  The Gallery team would like to thank Hanno Boeck for bringing this issue to our attention.
* XSS through malicious Flash files - Flash animations that are embedded in Gallery are no longer allowed to interact with the embedding page and are no longer allowed to open network connections.

  While this protects visitors of your Gallery from potentially malicious Flash animations, the Gallery team would like to use this opportunity to remind you that it is generally highly recommended to only allow trusted users to add any files to your Gallery.

There is no version 2.5 or 2.6.

What you might mean is version 2.2.5. And of course can you simply update from it as mentioned in the text on the top.

The 2.2.5 to 2.2.6 upgrade is mislabelled as (the second) 2.2.4 to 2.2.6

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Gallery: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200811-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Gallery may lead to execution of arbitrary
code, disclosure of local files or theft of user's credentials.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/gallery** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.6**revision >= **1.5.9**revision >= **1.5.10** |

### Background

Gallery is an open source web based photo album organizer.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Gallery 1 and 2:

* Digital Security Research Group reported a directory traversal
  vulnerability in contrib/phpBB2/modules.php in Gallery 1, when
  register\_globals is enabled (CVE-2008-3600).
* Hanno Boeck reported that Gallery 1 and 2 did not set the secure flag
  for the session cookie in an HTTPS session (CVE-2008-3662).
* Alex Ustinov reported that Gallery 1 and 2 does not properly handle ZIP
  archives containing symbolic links (CVE-2008-4129).
* The vendor reported a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Gallery 2
  (CVE-2008-4130).

### Impact

Remote attackers could send specially crafted requests to a server
running Gallery, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code when
register\_globals is enabled, or read arbitrary files via directory
traversals otherwise. Attackers could also entice users to visit
crafted links allowing for theft of login credentials.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Gallery 2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/gallery-2.2.6"
```

All Gallery 1 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/gallery-1.5.9"
```
