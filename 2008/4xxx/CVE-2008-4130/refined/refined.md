*   The attacker needs to have the ability to upload or embed Flash files into the vulnerable Gallery instance. This often requires some level of user privileges within the application.
*   The attacker would need to entice a user to interact with the malicious content, therefore the attacker would need to be remote.

**Additional Notes:**
