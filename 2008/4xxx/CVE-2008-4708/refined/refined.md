Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-4708:

**CVE Description:** (From Exploit-DB) BbZL.php 0.92 - Insecure Cookie Handling

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Insecure cookie handling in the BbZL.php 0.92 application. Specifically the `phorum_admin_session` cookie is not properly protected.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `phorum_admin_session` cookie can be manipulated client-side. This allows an attacker to set this cookie to '1', potentially granting them unauthorized access or administrative privileges.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: By manipulating the cookie, an attacker can gain administrative access to the application.
*   **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is client-side manipulation of the cookie via Javascript.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute Javascript in the victim's browser (e.g. through a malicious link). The provided exploit uses javascript, which can be executed on the victim's browser to set the malicious cookie value.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code is: `javascript:document.cookie = "phorum_admin_session=1; path=/";`. This JavaScript code, when executed in a user's browser on the vulnerable site, sets the `phorum_admin_session` cookie to `1` which gives administrative access.
*   The Exploit-DB entry provides additional context, including the author and platform of the vulnerability.
