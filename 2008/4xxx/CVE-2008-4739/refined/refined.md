Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability found in PlugSpace version 0.1.
- The vulnerability is caused by the insecure use of user-supplied input within the `include()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application directly includes a file path derived from the `navi` GET parameter. It does not sanitize or validate the input, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- The `include()` function at `/plugspace/index.php` line 80 is vulnerable, where it uses the `$_GET['navi']` parameter value to construct a file path without proper sanitization: `include("plugins/".$_GET['navi']."/main.php");`
- There's no check or restriction on the supplied path, enabling directory traversal using `../` sequences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can read sensitive local files on the server by manipulating the `navi` parameter. For example, an attacker could read the `/etc/passwd` file.
- **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive files can lead to further attacks by revealing system configuration, user data, or application source code.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL using the `navi` parameter to specify the path of the file to be included.
- The vulnerable URL structure is: `http://site.com/[plugspace]/index.php?navi=../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`
-  The `%00` byte is used for null byte injection, potentially to terminate the filename in cases where the `include()` function does not handle it correctly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic understanding of LFI vulnerabilities:** The attacker needs to know how to manipulate the `navi` parameter for path traversal and inclusion of arbitrary files.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a classic LFI that stems from the lack of input sanitization when constructing file paths used in `include` function. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, leading to information disclosure and potentially further attacks.
