  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to local file inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient input sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files and system files (e.g., /etc/passwd).",
    "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the 'post' or 'doc' parameters in the URL, an attacker can specify a path to a local file that the server will include. The null byte (%00) is used to terminate the path to bypass any filename extensions or restrictions that might be present.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application. No authentication is required for the attack."
  },
  "additional_details": {
        "magic_quotes_gpc_requirement": "The vulnerability is only exploitable when the PHP configuration 'magic_quotes_gpc' is set to Off.",
    "exploited_parameters": "The vulnerable parameters are 'post' and 'doc' in the 'index.php' file."
