  "CVE-2008-4264": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office Excel as a result of pointer corruption when loading Excel formulas. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Excel file that includes a malformed formula. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "root_cause": "Pointer corruption when loading Excel formulas due to a malformed formula in a specially crafted Excel file.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Remote code execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Complete control of an affected system, including the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted Excel file containing a malformed formula."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious Excel file with a malformed formula and convince the victim to open it. No special privileges are required.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in how Microsoft Office Excel parses the Excel spreadsheet file format. This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Excel spreadsheet with an affected version of Microsoft Office Excel. The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message. The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) can be used as a workaround to protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.  Microsoft Office File Block policy can be used to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations."
