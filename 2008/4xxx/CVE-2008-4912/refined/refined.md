          "SQL Injection"
        ],

        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication or specific privileges required.",
        "additional_details": "The provided exploit targets the `fotoID` parameter in `modules/fotogalerie/popup_img.php` by injecting SQL code to extract login and password information from the admin table. The exploit uses a standard SQL injection technique utilizing `UNION SELECT` to combine the results of the original query with the results of the injected query.",
