  {
    "CVE-2008-4405": {
        "Description": "Multiple unsafe uses of guest-writable data from xenstore.",
        "Root cause": "The xenstore directory tree, specifically within /local/domain/$DOMID, was not properly access-controlled, allowing guest VMs to write data that could be read and used by the host system or other applications. This included sensitive information like VNC port for graphical framebuffer, TTY path for text console, and device model PIDs.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Insecure Permissions",
            "Use of Untrusted Data"
        ],
        "Impact": "A malicious guest VM could write arbitrary data into xenstore, causing applications using that data to perform unsafe or unintended actions. This could include redirecting console access to a malicious location, denial of service, or potentially even executing code on the host system by manipulating the PID of the QEMU device model. It could also affect libvirt and other applications that rely on xenstore data, potentially impacting the management of the virtualized environment.",
         "Attack vectors": [
            "Guest VM compromise",
             "Xenstore Modification"
          ],
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have control over a guest VM in order to write malicious data to the xenstore"
    }
