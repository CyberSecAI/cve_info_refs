Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-4887:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a combination of vulnerabilities in NetRisk 2.0:
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Improper handling of user input in the `error` parameter.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data in the `id` parameter of the `profile` page and the `id` parameter of the `game` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XSS:** The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input when rendering error messages. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page, which will then be executed by the victim's browser.
*  **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided inputs when constructing SQL queries. This allows an attacker to manipulate queries to potentially extract sensitive data or execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:**
    *   Execution of malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser.
    *   Potential for session hijacking, cookie theft, and redirection to malicious sites.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Unauthorized access to the database.
    *   Extraction of sensitive data, including user credentials (usernames and passwords).
    *   Possibility of reading arbitrary files on the server, if the database user has sufficient privileges.
    *   Potential for data manipulation or deletion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** By crafting a malicious URL with the `error` parameter containing JavaScript code.
*   **SQL Injection:** By injecting SQL code through the `id` parameter in the `profile` page and `id` parameter in the `game` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **No authentication:** No prior authentication is required for exploitation.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP to craft malicious URLs.
*   **Basic SQL knowledge:** Exploiting the SQL injection vulnerabilities requires knowledge of SQL syntax.
*   **Basic javascript knowledge:** Exploiting the XSS requires basic javascript knowledge.

**Technical Details:**

*   **XSS:** The `index.php?error=<script>[javascript]</script>` URL demonstrates how to inject Javascript code through the error parameter.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   `index.php?p=profile&id=1+union+all+select+0,0,concat(login,0x3a,password),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0+from+netrisk_users+where+id=1/*` demonstrates how to extract user credentials by manipulating the SQL query.
    *   `index.php?p=profile&id=1+union+all+select+0,0,load_file(0x2F6574632F706173737764),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0/*` demonstrates how to read the `/etc/passwd` file (or other files) from the server.
    *    `index.php?p=game&id=1 and ascii(substring((select password from netrisk_users where id=1),1,1))=[ascii]/*` shows an example of a blind SQL injection technique.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content gives detailed examples of how to exploit the vulnerabilities.
* The vulnerabilities work regardless of php.ini settings.
* The exploit was discovered by StAkeR aka athos
