Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4088:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `print.php` file of myPHPNuke, which leads to both Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `sid` parameter in `print.php` is vulnerable to XSS because user-supplied input is not sanitized before being displayed on the page.
2.  **SQL Injection:** The `sid` parameter is also vulnerable to SQL injection because user-supplied data is directly used in a SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a vulnerable page, which can lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, and other malicious activities on a user's browser.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data such as usernames and passwords from the database. This can result in a full compromise of the application. The provided example demonstrates retrieval of administrator login credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `print.php` page with the `sid` parameter, using HTTP GET requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable myPHPNuke server.
*   No special privileges or authentication are required. The attacker needs to only be able to access the vulnerable site.
*   The attacker can be remote and doesn't need any special position in the network.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects myPHPNuke versions prior to 1.8.8\_8rc2.
*   Version 1.8.8\_8rc2 is still vulnerable to limited SQL injection (without spaces and brackets).
*   The provided exploit URLs demonstrate how to trigger the XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   XSS Example: `http://site/print.php?sid=%3CBODY%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E`
    *   SQL Injection Example: `http://site/print.php?sid=-1%20union%20select%20null,null,aid,pwd,null,null%20from%20mpn_authors%20limit%200,1`
*   The exploit allows extraction of the administrator login and password hash from the `mpn_authors` table.
*   The provided CVSS score is 7.5, indicating a high-severity vulnerability, with full exploitability.
