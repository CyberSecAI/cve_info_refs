  {
    "CVE": "CVE-2008-4128",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper CSRF protection in the HTTP administration interface of Cisco routers.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the Cisco router.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker embeds a malicious form in a webpage. When a logged-in administrator visits the webpage, the form is automatically submitted to the router's HTTP interface, executing the attacker's commands.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator of the Cisco router to visit a malicious webpage. The attacker does not need direct access to the router's network."
