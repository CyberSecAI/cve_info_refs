Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Null Byte Local File Inclusion vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to include a null byte (%00) within a file path. This can be used to bypass intended file path restrictions and access arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application allows the use of directory traversal sequences ("../") in the provided file path which allows the attacker to navigate outside the intended web directory.
*   **Null Byte Injection:** The application fails to handle null bytes in file paths correctly. The inclusion of a null byte terminates the file path string prematurely. In this case, the application reads content of the targeted file until a null byte is encountered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can read the contents of any file on the server that the web server user has access to. This can include sensitive information like database credentials, configuration files, source code, or user data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL containing the null byte character (%00) in the file path parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to be aware of the file paths on the server which contains the information they're targeting.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `c` in the `index.php` file.
*   The application `FAR - PHP Project version:1.0` is vulnerable.
*   The specific payload used is `index.php?c=/../../../../../../../../boot.ini%00`.
