Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `go` parameter of the `index.php` script. Specifically, the application fails to validate and escape user-supplied input in the `go` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `go` parameter, an attacker can manipulate database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** Attackers can use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
- **Data Manipulation:** Malicious SQL queries can be used to modify or delete data in the database.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, it could be possible to gain elevated privileges within the application if the database user has sufficient permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted URL, specifically targeting the `go` parameter within the `index.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not require prior authentication, making it easier to exploit.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious queries.
