RELATED: CVE-2008-4586
Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `DownloadAndExecute` method of the `isusweb.dll` ActiveX control provided by Macrovision FlexNet. This method allows arbitrary code execution because it downloads and executes files from a specified URL without proper validation.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the `DownloadAndExecute` method of `isusweb.dll`
- Lack of proper validation of the URL and downloaded file.
- Unsafe use of the ActiveX control leading to arbitrary code execution.

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
- Attackers could potentially gain full control over the affected machine.

Attack vectors:
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTML page that uses JavaScript to invoke the vulnerable `DownloadAndExecute` method of the ActiveX control.
-  The vulnerable ActiveX control is identified by `clsid:1DF951B1-8D40-4894-A04C-66AD824A0EEF`

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to have the ability to make the victim open a malicious HTML page using a web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer).
- The victim must have the vulnerable ActiveX control installed on their system.
- No specific user interaction beyond opening the malicious page is needed, the exploit executes automatically.
