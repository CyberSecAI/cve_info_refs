How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=468014#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-10-22 12:26:14 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2008-4619](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-4619) to the following vulnerability:  The RPC subsystem in Sun Solaris 9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted request to procedure 8, related to the XDR_DECODE operation and the taddr2uaddr function.  References: <http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/6775>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=468014#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-10-22 12:38:39 UTC  ``` This also crashes rpcbind on Fedora and seems to be a libtirpc issue.  In rpcb_service_4(), rpcbind calls libtirpc's xdr_netbuf() when taddr2uaddr decode is required.  xdr_netbuf() first reads maxlen from the argument, later uses this as an upper bound while reading transport-encoded address to objp->buf using xdr_bytes() without further validation.  However, malicious request from the PoC referenced above causes maxlen to be 0, which causes xdr_bytes() to return TRUE without initializing objp->buf.  That is later used as inet_ntop argument, causing SEGV.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=468014#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2008-10-22 12:41:24 UTC  ``` Steve, can you please check whether I'm missing anything here?  You also seem to be part of the libtirpc's upstream, can you let other libtirpc developers know about this issue, or should I try to contact them?  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=468014#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2008-10-24 20:09:04 UTC  ``` I've created upstream bug report for this: <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2192645&group_id=183075&atid=903784>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=468014#c4)  Steve Dickson    2008-10-27 16:40:07 UTC  ``` I'm thinking the problem is not in xdr_netbuf() since its valid  to return a zero length buffer.

Nothing against these sources but in general CVE wants a solid "logic
chain" between 2 descriptions before declaring a dupe.  In this case
CVE-2007-0165 is anchored on a very vague description from Sun about
something in libnsl.  CVE-2008-4619 is quite specific.  Just because it's
the same rpcbind service is insufficient as we all know that the same
package can contain multiple security bugs.

The most solid connection here, though, is SUNALERT:102713 (which
CVE-2007-0165 is anchored on) has now been renamed to SUNALERT:200412,
which directly references CVE-2008-4619.

I'll send a quick-check email to Sun but these do appear to be dupes.  So
then the question is which CVE to reject, and I'm not sure at this moment.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Looks like this is a dupe of CVE-2007-0165 after all...

Hi!

Just a heads up ...  In the case you distribute rpcbind using
(lib)tirpc as an RPC port mapper, you may be interested in the
CVE-2008-4619.  Some more info is in our BZ, along with Steve Dickson's
patch: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=468014>

This is very likely the same issue as Solaris one, as tirpc is based on
the Sun's RPC source code, and fails in the same place.
