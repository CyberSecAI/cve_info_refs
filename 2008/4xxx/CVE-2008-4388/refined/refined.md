The provided content is related to CVE-2008-4388.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Symantec AppStream LaunchObj ActiveX control, specifically the `installAppMgr()` method, allows for the download and execution of arbitrary code due to insufficient validation of downloaded files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe methods within the ActiveX control
- Lack of validation of downloaded files
- Control is marked "Safe for Scripting" in Internet Explorer, enabling exploitation via scripting.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user viewing a malicious HTML document (e.g., webpage, HTML email)
- Complete compromise of the user's system

**Attack vectors:**
- Specially crafted HTML documents (web pages, HTML emails, attachments)
- Exploitation through Internet Explorer due to the ActiveX control being marked safe for scripting.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to convince a user to view a specially crafted HTML document.
- No specific position is required, as exploitation is achieved through a web browser.
