Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4794:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Opera does not correctly sanitize content when certain parameters are passed to Opera's History Search.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input sanitization in the History Search functionality of the Opera browser. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can inject and execute arbitrary scripts into the History Search results page. The scripts run with elevated privileges within the browser's context, potentially leading to further compromise of user data or system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted parameters passed to Opera's History Search feature. It is not clear from this content how this is achieved specifically, other than the parameters being "certain" parameters and the exploitation is "remote".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the parameters passed to the Opera History Search to inject malicious code. This suggests a scenario where a user might be tricked into interacting with a crafted link or page, or even malicious code loaded into the browser, that then triggers the vulnerability. The attacker is remote.

**Additional details:**

- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities found in Opera that were fixed in version 9.62.
- The Gentoo advisory notes that this allows "to run scripts injected into Opera's History Search with elevated privileges".
- The openSUSE security report also mentions the fix for opera as upgrading to version 9.62 and states "multiple vulnerabilities" were fixed.
