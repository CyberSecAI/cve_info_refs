  "CVE-2008-4234": {
    "description": "Mac OS X provides the Download Validation capability to indicate potentially unsafe files. Applications such as Safari and others use Download Validation to help warn users prior to launching files marked as potentially unsafe. This update adds to the list of potentially unsafe types. It adds the content type for files that have executable permissions and no specific application association. These files are potentially unsafe as they will launch in Terminal and their content will be executed as commands. While these files are not automatically launched, if manually opened they could lead to the execution of arbitrary code. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5.",
    "root_cause": "Incomplete Download Validation",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incomplete validation of downloaded file types, specifically for files with executable permissions lacking application association."
    ],
    "impact": "If manually opened by the user, the malicious files can lead to arbitrary code execution",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "User downloads a file and manually opens it. The file is treated as executable and is launched in Terminal."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker must create a file with executable permissions and no specific application association, and then convince a user to download it and manually open it."
