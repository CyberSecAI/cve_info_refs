How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## wnpa-sec-2008-06 · Multiple problems in Wireshark

## Summary

**Name:** Multiple problems in Wireshark

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2008-06

**Date:** October 20, 2008

**Affected versions:** 0.10.3 up to and including 1.0.3

**Fixed versions:** 1.0.4

## Details

### Description

Wireshark 1.0.4 fixes the following vulnerabilities:

* Florent Drouin and David Maciejak of Fortinet's FortiGuard Global Security
  Research Team independently discovered that the Bluetooth ACL dissector could
  crash or abort.

  (Bug )

  Versions affected: 0.99.2 to 1.0.3
  * The Q.931 dissector could crash or abort.

    (Bug )

    Versions affected: 0.10.3 to 1.0.3
    * Wireshark could abort while reading Tamos CommView capture files.

      (Bug )

      Versions affected: 0.99.7 to 1.0.3
      * David Maciejak found that the USB dissector could crash or abort.
        This led to the discovery of a similar problem in the Bluetooth
        RFCOMM dissector.

        (Bug )

        Versions affected: 0.99.7 to 1.0.3
        * Vivek Gupta and David Maciejak found that the PRP and MATE dissectors could make Wireshark crash. (Neither PRP nor MATE are enabled by default.)

          (Bug )
          Versions affected: 0.99.2 to 1.0.3

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a series of malformed
packets onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace
file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.0.4 or later. Due to the nature of the bugs, there is
no workaround for previous versions.

wireshark security update (RHSA-2009-0313)

Original Release Date: March 11, 2009

Last Revised: March 11, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-082

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Wireshark is a program for monitoring network traffic. Wireshark was
previously known as Ethereal.

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in Wireshark. If Wireshark
read
a malformed packet off a network or opened a malformed dump file, it
could
crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code as the user running
Wireshark.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names
[CVE-2008-4683](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4683) and
[CVE-2009-0599](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0599) to these issues.

Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark
could
crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
opened a malformed dump file. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2008-4680](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4680),
[CVE-2008-4681](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4681),

| Avaya Communication Manager | 3.x, 4.x, 5.x | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya strongly recommends that
customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |
| AES 4.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied by RedHat Linux.
