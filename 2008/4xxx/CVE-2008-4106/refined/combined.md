Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in wordpress, weblog
manager. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2008-6762

It was discovered that wordpress is prone to an open redirect
vulnerability which allows remote attackers to conduct phishing atacks.

CVE-2008-6767

It was discovered that remote attackers had the ability to trigger an
application upgrade, which could lead to a denial of service attack.

CVE-2009-2334

It was discovered that wordpress lacks authentication checks in the
plugin configuration, which might leak sensitive information.

CVE-2009-2854

It was discovered that wordpress lacks authentication checks in various
actions, thus allowing remote attackers to produce unauthorised edits or
additions.

CVE-2009-2851

It was discovered that the administrator interface is prone to a
cross-site scripting attack.

CVE-2009-2853

It was discovered that remote attackers can gain privileges via certain
direct requests.

CVE-2008-1502

It was discovered that the _bad_protocol_once function in KSES, as used
by wordpress, allows remote attackers to perform cross-site scripting
attacks.

CVE-2008-4106

It was discovered that wordpress lacks certain checks around user
information, which could be used by attackers to change the password of
a user.

CVE-2008-4769

It was discovered that the get_category_template function is prone to a
directory traversal vulnerability, which could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-4796

It was discovered that the _httpsrequest function in the embedded snoopy
version is prone to the execution of arbitrary commands via shell
metacharacters in https URLs.

CVE-2008-5113

It was discovered that wordpress relies on the REQUEST superglobal array
in certain dangerous situations, which makes it easier to perform
attacks via crafted cookies.

# WordPress 2.6.2

---

[Stefan Esser](http://www.suspekt.org/) recently warned developers of the dangers of [SQL Column Truncation](http://www.suspekt.org/2008/08/18/mysql-and-sql-column-truncation-vulnerabilities/) and the [weakness of mt\_rand()](http://www.suspekt.org/2008/08/17/mt_srand-and-not-so-random-numbers/).  With his help we worked around these problems and are now releasing WordPress 2.6.2.  If you allow open registration on your blog, you should definitely upgrade.  With open registration enabled, it is possible in WordPress versions 2.6.1 and earlier to craft a username such that it will allow resetting another user’s password to a randomly generated password.  The randomly generated password is not disclosed to the attacker, so this problem by itself is annoying but not a security exploit.  However, this attack coupled with a weakness in the random number seeding in mt\_rand() could be used to predict the randomly generated password.  Stefan Esser will release details of the complete attack shortly.  The attack is difficult to accomplish,  but its mere possibility means we recommend upgrading to 2.6.2.

Other PHP apps are susceptible to this class of attack.  To protect all of your apps, grab the [latest version of Suhosin](http://www.suspekt.org/2008/08/22/suhosin-0926-improved-randomness/).  If you’ve already updated Suhosin, your existing WordPress install is already protected from the full exploit.  You should still upgrade to 2.6.2 if you allow open user registration so as to prevent the possibility of passwords being randomized.

2.6.2 also contains a [handful of bug fixes](https://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=2.6.2&resolution=fixed&order=priority).  Check out the [full changeset and list of changed files](https://trac.wordpress.org/changeset?old_path=tags%2F2.6.1&old=8849&new_path=tags%2F2.6.2&new=8849).

# MySQL and SQL Column Truncation Vulnerabilities

While SQL-Injection is one of the most discussed security problems in web applications other possible problems for SQL queries like overlong input are usually ignored although they can lead to all kinds of security problems.

This might be caused by the fact that security problems that are the result of overlong input are often buffer overflows and buffer overflows are something many web application security experts know nothing about and choose to ignore.

There are however several security problems for SQL queries that are caused by overlong input and no one talks about.

### max\_packet\_size

In MySQL there exists a configuration option called max\_packet\_size which is set to one megabyte by default and controls the maximum size of a packet sent between the SQL client and server. When queries or result rows do not fit into a single packet a error is raised. This means an overlong SQL query is never sent to the server and therefore never executed.

This can lead to security problems when an attacker is able to supply long data elements that are then used in SQL queries. A good example are logging queries that combine information like the HTTP User-Agent, session ids and log messages into a large query that then does not fit into the packet anymore.

Another example from a real world application is a session table cleanup process that first selects all sessions matching certain parameters into a PHP array, then performs a multiple level cleanup and in the end all selected session ids are put into single delete query. It should be obvious that when there are many session identifiers in the table that need deletion the query gets too long. The result of this is that flooding the application with new sessions in a short time will result in no unused session being deleted later anymore.

Therefore web application developers should always ensure that they do not sent overlong data to the server. And it doesn’t matter if they use prepared statements or not.

### SQL Column Truncation Vulnerabilities

When user input is not checked for its length SQL Column Truncation Vulnerabilities can arise. “SQL Column Truncation Vulnerability” is the name I use to describe security problems arising from overlong input that is truncated during insertion in the database. By default MySQL will truncate strings longer than the defined maximum column width and only emit a warning. Those warnings are usually not seen by web applications and therefore not handled at all. In MySQL the sql\_mode STRICT\_ALL\_TABLES can be activated to turn these warnings into errors but applications will run most of the time on servers that run in the default mode and even if an application uses the stricter sql\_mode it should not produce this error in the first place. Therefore a length check is required.

To understand why the truncation on insert can lead to security problems imagine the following application.

* The application is a forum where new users can register
* The administrator’s name is known e.g. ‘admin’
* MySQL is used in the default mode
* There is no application restriction on the length of new user names
* The database column username is limited to 16 characters

A potential attacker might now try to register the name ‘admin ‘, which will fail because the ‘isAlreadyRegistered’ check will result in the SQL query.

```
SELECT * FROM user WHERE username='admin '
```

Because MySQL does not compare strings in binary mode by default more relaxed comparison rules are used. One of these relaxations is that trailing space characters are ignored during the comparison. This means the string ‘admin    ‘ is still equal to the string ‘admin’ in the database. And therefore the application will refuse to accept the new user.

If the attacker however tries the username ‘admin           x’ the application will search for it in the database and will not find it, because it is impossible to find a username with a length of 17 in a database field that has a 16 character limit. The application will accept the new username and insert it into the database. However the username column is to short for the full name and therefore it is truncated and ‘admin           ‘ is inserted into the database.

The result of this is that the user table now contains two users that due to trailing spaces both will be returned when the SELECT query above is executed. At this point a potential security problem arises because now it depends on how the username is treated throughout the application. The following pseudocode for example is vulnerable.

```
$userdata = null;
if (isPasswordCorrect($username, $password)) {
   $userdata = getUserDataByLogin($username);
   ...
}
```

When the previous piece of code uses the SQL query

```
SELECT username FROM users WHERE username = ? AND passhash = ?
```

to detect if the user password is correct and then does a lookup of the user data by name a security problem manifests.

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?
```

Because the attacker created the newly created admin user he knows the correct password to pass this check. And because the real admin user is first in the table it will be returned first when the user data lookup by name is executed later.

### Conclusion

Both problems described here are two new things web applications needs to be audited for because both can lead to real security problems. And because no one searches for these kind of vulnerabilities, now that it is public most probably the next weeks will bring several advisories about open source software suffering from these problems.

Stefan Esser recently warned developers of the dangers of SQL Column
Truncation and the weakness of mt_rand().  With his help we worked around
these problems and are now releasing WordPress 2.6.2.  If you allow open
registration on your blog, you should definitely upgrade.  With open
registration enabled, it is possible in WordPress versions 2.6.1 and earlier
to craft a username such that it will allow resetting another user’s password
to a randomly generated password.  The randomly generated password is not
disclosed to the attacker, so this problem by itself is annoying but not a
security exploit.  However, this attack coupled with a weakness in the random
number seeding in mt_rand() could be used to predict the randomly generated
password.  Stefan Esser will release details of the complete attack shortly.
The attack is difficult to accomplish,  but its mere possibility means we
recommend upgrading to 2.6.2.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

#
# in this hack we can remote change admin password, if registration enabled
#
# greets: Stefan Esser, Lukasz Pilorz, cOndemned, tbh, sid.psycho, str0ke and all fiends

1. go to url: server.com/wp-login.php?action=register

2. register as:

login: admin                                                       x
email: your email

^ admin[55 space chars]x

now, we have duplicated 'admin' account in database

3. go to url: server.com/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword

4. write your email into field and submit this form

5. check your email and go to reset confirmation link

6. admin's password changed, but new password will be send to correct admin email ;/

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
