Package        : mysql-dfsg-5.0
Vulnerability  : authorization bypass
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-4098
Debian Bug     : 480292

A symlink traversal vulnerability was discovered in MySQL, a
relational database server.  The weakness could permit an attacker
having both CREATE TABLE access to a database and the ability to
execute shell commands on the database server to bypass MySQL access
controls, enabling them to write to tables in databases to which they
would not ordinarily have access.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this
vulnerability as CVE-2008-4098.  Note that a closely aligned issue,
identified as CVE-2008-4097, was prevented by the update announced in
DSA-1608-1.  This new update supercedes that fix and mitigates both
potential attack vectors.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch8.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Subject: CVE-2008-2079: mysql allows local users to bypass certain privilege checks
Date: Fri, 09 May 2008 21:02:35 +1000
```
Package: mysql-server-5.0
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Hi

The following CVE(0) has been issued against mysql.

[CVE-2008-2079](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2079):

MySQL 4.1.x before 4.1.24, 5.0.x before 5.0.60, 5.1.x before 5.1.24, and
6.0.x before 6.0.5 allows local users to bypass certain privilege checks
by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1) DATA
DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within the MySQL
home data directory, which can point to tables that are created in the
future.

Please mention the CVE id in your changelog, if you fix the issue by an
upload.

The mysql bugreport can be found here(1).

Cheers
Steffen

   [ Norbert Tretkowski ]
   * SECURITY:
     Fix for [CVE-2008-2079](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2079): It was possible to circumvent privileges through
     the creation of MyISAM tables employing the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX
     DIRECTORY options to overwrite existing table files in the MySQL data
     directory. Use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX
     DIRECTORY is now disallowed. Patch from openSUSE 11.0, thanks to Michal
     Marek. (closes: #[480292](bugreport.cgi?bug=480292))
   * Fix build on non-linux systems, like hurd-i386. (closes: #[480362](bugreport.cgi?bug=480362))
   * Include symlinks for mysqlcheck. (closes: #[480647](bugreport.cgi?bug=480647))
 .
   [ Monty Taylor ]
   * Remove ndb_cpcd, as it is only for the NDB test suite and not useful as a
     public program.
   * Fix debian-start.inc.sh for table names with characters needing quotes.
     Thanks Felix Rublack! (closes: #[480525](bugreport.cgi?bug=480525), #[481154](bugreport.cgi?bug=481154), #[481303](bugreport.cgi?bug=481303), #[484012](bugreport.cgi?bug=484012))
   * Delete mysql-common.README.Debian. Nothing in it was relevant, and the
     useful information is in mysql-server anyway. (closes: #[480940](bugreport.cgi?bug=480940))
   * Remove a spurious HOME= in logrotate script.

I don't believe that the patch applied to address this bug was sufficient.  In
preparing the stable update I initially applied it, before finding two things:

First, fn_format() only calls readlink() once on the entire path, not on any
component thereof; hence it will only actually detect when the last component
of a path was a symlink.  Exploiting this merely requires adding another path
component below the symlink path -- for example:

	$ ls -l /tmp/foo
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 aqua 1000 14 Jul  3 05:36 /tmp/foo -> /var/lib/mysql

	mysql> use test1 ;
	Database changed

	mysql> create table t (a int) data directory '/tmp/foo' ;
	ERROR 1210 (HY000): Incorrect arguments to DATA DIRECORY

	mysql> create table t (a int) data directory '/tmp/foo/mysql' ;
	Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

	$ ls -l /var/lib/mysql/mysql/t.MYD
	-rw-rw---- 1 mysql mysql 0 Jul  3 07:27 /var/lib/mysql/mysql/t.MYD

Second, even if fn_format() did fully resolve symlinks in the path, its output
is actually ignored; this is an except from 92_SECURITY_CVE-2008-2079.dpatch
in mysql-dfsg-5.0 5.0.51a-9:

	+static bool test_if_data_home_dir(const char *dir)
	+{
	[...]
	+  (void) fn_format(path, dir, "", "",
	+                   (MY_RETURN_REAL_PATH|MY_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS));
	+  dir_len= unpack_dirname(conv_path, dir);
	[...]
	+    else if (!memcmp(conv_path, mysql_unpacked_real_data_home, home_dir_len))
	+      DBUG_RETURN(1);

fn_format reads the potentially hostile 'dir' and writes the marginally
readlink()'ed result to 'path'.  But unpack_dirname is passed 'dir' again, not
'path', so it's the origianl string which is used in the subsequent
comparison.

In terms of exploitability, this allows any user with permissions to create
tables in a db the ability to read from, write to and delete tables from any
other database within the same mysql instance.

Hi Devin!

Looks like upstream patch is incomplete.  Have you already notified
upstream about the problem?

> In terms of exploitability, this allows any user with permissions to
> create tables in a db the ability to read from, write to and delete
> tables from any other database within the same mysql instance.

Can you possibly explain this a little closer?  MySQL should not allow
you to overwrite existing tables via DATA/INDEX DIRECTORY directives.
So you can only get access to tables created in the future, if you can
predict their names.  Or have you managed to escalate privileges to
already existing tables using this flaw?

Thanks!

Not yet -- I still need to hand verify it against a pristine upstream; it's
reproducible with 5.0.51a from Sid, but the implementation of the path check
has changed significantly from the original patch.  I'll look into that once I
get a workable fix out for etch.

Sorry, I was taking the temporal part of the attack as read -- yes, the attack
is still based on creating the hostile tables before the victim database does.

Here's a patch I'm building for an Etch update to address the problem.  It's
pretty close to the same one used in the first fix to this bug, except that it
adds a call to realpath() to resolve all components of the path, and fixes the
argument passing so as not to throw the resolved forms away.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- apache2
The security update of apache2 released at 2008/11/05 packages its modules
differently (/usr/lib/apache2-prefork vs. /usr/lib/apache2-worker). This
can, in seldom cases, cause a services (like iPrint) stop working if it
expects the modules in a special directory.
New packages will be released as soon as possible.
- ipsec-tools
Remote attackers could exploit memory leaks in the 'racoon' daemon
to crash it (CVE-2008-3651, CVE-2008-3652)
Affected products: all
- kernel-bigsmp
This kernel update fixes various bugs and also several security issues:
CVE-2008-4576: Fixed a crash in SCTP INIT-ACK, on mismatch between SCTP
AUTH availability. This might be exploited remotely for a denial of
service (crash) attack.
CVE-2008-3833: The generic\_file\_splice\_write function in fs/splice.c
in the Linux kernel does not properly strip setuid and setgid bits
when there is a write to a file, which allows local users to gain the
privileges of a different group, and obtain sensitive information or
possibly have unspecified other impact, by splicing into an inode in
order to create an executable file in a setgid directory.
CVE-2008-4210: fs/open.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22 does not
properly strip setuid and setgid bits when there is a write to a file,
which allows local users to gain the privileges of a different group, and
obtain sensitive information or possibly have unspecified other impact,
by creating an executable file in a setgid directory through the (1)
truncate or (2) ftruncate function in conjunction with memory-mapped I/O.
CVE-2008-4302: fs/splice.c in the splice subsystem in the Linux
kernel before 2.6.22.2 does not properly handle a failure of the
add\_to\_page\_cache\_lru function, and subsequently attempts to unlock a page
that was not locked, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
(kernel BUG and system crash), as demonstrated by the fio I/O tool.
CVE-2008-3528: The ext[234] filesystem code fails to properly handle
corrupted data structures. With a mounted filesystem image or partition
that have corrupted dir->i\_size and dir->i\_blocks, a user performing
either a read or write operation on the mounted image or partition can
lead to a possible denial of service by spamming the logfile.
CVE-2007-6716: fs/direct-io.c in the dio subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly zero out the dio struct, which allows local users to
cause a denial of service (OOPS), as demonstrated by a certain fio test.
CVE-2008-3525: Added missing capability checks in sbni\_ioctl().
CVE-2008-3272: Fixed range checking in the snd\_seq OSS ioctl, which
could be used to leak information from the kernel.
CVE-2008-2931: The do\_change\_type function in fs/namespace.c did not
verify that the caller has the CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN capability, which allows
local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service by modifying
the properties of a mountpoint.
CVE-2008-2812: Various NULL ptr checks have been added to tty op
functions, which might have been used by local attackers to execute
code. We think that this affects only devices openable by root, so the
impact is limited.
CVE-2008-1673: Added range checking in ASN.1 handling for the CIFS and
SNMP NAT netfilter modules.
CVE-2008-3527: arch/i386/kernel/sysenter.c in the Virtual Dynamic Shared
Objects (vDSO) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.21 did not
properly check boundaries, which allows local users to gain privileges
or cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors, related to the
install\_special\_mapping, syscall, and syscall32\_nopage functions.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2
- flash-player
This update of flash-player fixes several critical security vulner-
abilities that couls lead to remote system compromise.
(CVE-2007-6243, CVE-2008-3873, CVE-2007-4324, CVE-2008-4401,
CVE-2008-4503, CVE-2008-4546)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-11.0, Novell Linux Desktop 9,
SLED 10 SP1 and SP2
- mysql
Empty bit-strings in a query could crash the MySQL server (CVE-2008-3963).
Due to another flaw users could access tables of other users (CVE-2008-
4097, CVE-2008-4098).
Affected products: all (so far only released for SLES10, others will
follow)
- ktorrent
This update of ktorrent fixes several security issues.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Subject: Re: CVE request: MySQL incomplete fix for
 CVE-2008-2079

Hi!

While we are on the MySQL, following issue should probably get CVE id
as well...

CVE id CVE-2008-2079 was assigned to MySQL flaw that allowed attackers
to get access to the tables created by other database users in the
future.

Devin Carraway of Debian noticed, that the upstream fix can be defeated
by local users via directory symlinks:

  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=480292#25>

Patch used in the DSA-1608-1 differed from the upstream fix by addition
of realpath call to expand all symlinks in the path specified in DATA /
INDEX DIRECTORY directives:

  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=480292#42>

Which is also possible to defeat, as described by Devin in the upstream
bug report related to the original issue:

  <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32167>
  comment dated with "[18 Jul 9:43]"

Upstream addressed the problem by doing the check at open time, not
only at creation time, and the fix is mentioned in the 5.0.70 (and
possibly other) release notes (using original CVE id):

  <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/releasenotes-es-5-0-70.html>

# USN-671-1: MySQL vulnerabilities

17 November 2008

MySQL vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [mysql-dfsg-5.0](/security/cves?package=mysql-dfsg-5.0) -

## Details

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table

files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use the

DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly bypass privilege

checks. This update alters table creation behaviour by disallowing the

use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY

options. ([CVE-2008-2079](/security/CVE-2008-2079), [CVE-2008-4097](/security/CVE-2008-4097) and [CVE-2008-4098](/security/CVE-2008-4098))

It was discovered that MySQL did not handle empty bit-string literals

properly. An attacker could exploit this problem and cause the MySQL

server to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3963](/security/CVE-2008-3963))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.51a-3ubuntu5.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.51a-3ubuntu5.4)

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.45-1ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.45-1ubuntu3.4)

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06.11](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06.11)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

MySQL vulnerabilities

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [mysql-dfsg-5.0](/security/cves?package=mysql-dfsg-5.0) -
* [mysql-dfsg-5.1](/security/cves?package=mysql-dfsg-5.1) -

## Details

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table

files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use the DATA

DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly bypass privilege checks.

This update alters table creation behaviour by disallowing the use of the

MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 8.10. ([CVE-2008-4098](/security/CVE-2008-4098))

It was discovered that MySQL contained a cross-site scripting vulnerability

in the command-line client when the --html option is enabled. An attacker

could place arbitrary web script or html in a database cell, which would

then get placed in the html document output by the command-line tool. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04.

([CVE-2008-4456](/security/CVE-2008-4456))

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table

files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use symlinks

combined with the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly

bypass privilege checks. This issue only affected Ubuntu 9.10.

([CVE-2008-7247](/security/CVE-2008-7247))

It was discovered that MySQL contained multiple format string flaws when

logging database creation and deletion. An authenticated user could use

specially crafted database names to make MySQL crash, causing a denial of

service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04.

([CVE-2009-2446](/security/CVE-2009-2446))

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled errors when performing

certain SELECT statements, and did not preserve correct flags when

performing statements that use the GeomFromWKB function. An authenticated

user could exploit this to make MySQL crash, causing a denial of service.

([CVE-2009-4019](/security/CVE-2009-4019))

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly checked symlinks when using the

DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. A local user could use symlinks

to create tables that pointed to tables known to be created at a later

time, bypassing access restrictions. ([CVE-2009-4030](/security/CVE-2009-4030))

It was discovered that MySQL contained a buffer overflow when parsing

ssl certificates. A remote attacker could send crafted requests and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue did not

affect Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and the default compiler options for affected

releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. In the

default installation, attackers would also be isolated by the AppArmor

MySQL profile. ([CVE-2009-4484](/security/CVE-2009-4484))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Description:
When one creates a MyISAM table with

   CREATE TABLE ( ) DATA DIRECTORY ... INDEX DIRECTORY ...

there're special checks to ensure that existing tables are not overwritten via symlinks. That is, one cannot create a 'user' table in the 'test' db, with DATA DIRECTORY pointing to 'mysql' db.

When one creates a table without symlinks, existing files are overwritten. It is intentional too.

But it creates a problem similar to "insecure tempfile creation" - an attacker can create a table with MYD/MYI files in another database, and if another user will later create a table in that database with the same name, the attacker will be able to access the table bypassing privilege checks.

How to repeat:
root> grant all privileges on test.* to test@localhost;

test> create table t1 (a int) data directory '/MySQL/var/mysql', index directory '/MySQL/var/mysql';

root> flush tables;
root> create table t1 (a int);
root> insert t1 values (1),(2),(3);
root> flush tables;

test> select * from t1;

Suggested fix:
don't allow symlinks into datadir

Documented bugfix in the 4.1.24, 5.0.60, 5.1.24, and 6.0.5 changelogs as follows:

        It was possible to circumvent privileges through the creation of
        MyISAM tables employing the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY
        options to overwrite existing table files in the MySQL data
        directory. Use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and
        INDEX DIRECTORY is now disallowed.

In addition, the changelog entries for 5.1.24 and 6.0.5 includes the statement:

                                           This is also true for partitioned
        tables and individual table partitions.

Also added a note to the relevant section of the CREATE TABLE Syntax section in the 4.1./5.0/5.1/6.0 Manuals.

It was merged from 4.1. Note that 5.1 required a new fix only because of a new feature - partitioning, not because we do a separate patch for every branch.

When I'm looking in my 5.0 tree this is what I see:

At least some of the patches attached to this bug do not appear to be sufficient to address the vulnerability.  Commit#38278 and #38623 call fn_format() with MY_RETURN_REAL_PATH but not MY_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS; this will cause my_realpath (as it appears in 5.0.51b) to rely entirely on an lstat() check to determine whether the given target is a symlink.  This is insufficient because an attacker can supply the path to a real directory underneath a symlink (e.g. /tmp/{foo -> /var/lib}/mysql) without triggering a simple lstat().

Commit #38680 and #38704 are even worse, in that besides the above problem, they then discard the output of fn_format() entirely, reusing the original input for comparison against the mysql data homedir.

Commit #38932, #38937, #38952, #39513, #40134, #41636, #43143 and #43206 are a mix of these -- they pass MY_RETURN_REAL_PATH to fn_format(), but then ignore its output.

Note that my reading of these patches is based on 5.0.51b and 5.0.32's implementations of fn_format() as a reference; I've tested that backports of #38680/38704 to these versions do not correct the vulnerability, but am only doing a visual reading of the others.
```

```
Also, the check is not sufficient. test_if_data_home_dir() should be called every time the table is opened, not only when it's created.

After a discussion with other members of the Debian security team, I wanted to pass on a request that you consider a non-path based solution to this issue, at least on operating systems where one is feasible.

There are two basic problems with the path-based fix to this bug employed thus far.  First and most simply, it only works to protect database users who store their data/index files under the mysql data root (whether by deliberate act or by default).  Users who store a table's files outside that path (e.g. to manage disk resources) are still vulnerable to attack.

Secondly, on many operating systems paths aren't a reliable mapping to files.  Linux, for example, supplies bind mounts, where a subset of one filesystem can be made to appear in another location.  There is no symlinking, and a realpath() called on a file in a bind mount will not return the path from the "source" filesystem.  The unionfs feature in FreeBSD, Linux and Plan9 present the same problem, and MacOS' recently-added directory hardlinks probably do as well.  Most of these cases require sysadmin/DBA intervention to bring about the preconditions for the attack, but while unusual are hardly unprecedented.

Under most conditions, the proper fix would be to create new files with O_CREAT|O_EXCL and not try to control path usage.  However, in mysql's particular case this turns an authorization check bypass weakness into a DoS weakness -- though it might be the only viable option for supporting arbitrary user-supplied paths outside the mysql data directory.  For protection within the data directory, you might consider doing inode-based checks based on device+inode number, which are stable at least across bind mounts.  Or you could make passing DATA/INDEX DIRECTORY clauses to CREATE TABLE statements a privileged operation in itself.
```

[14 Jul 2008 11:13]
Sergei Golubchik
```
There's an option to create new files with O_CREAT|O_EXCL. See mysqld --help for keep_files_on_create.

I'm not sure I understand your device+inode idea - does it mean the server would need to scan all databases in the datadir to know all inode numbers of all tables ?
```

Hello Sergey

I guess this would indeed mean that MySQL would have to do a stat() call for every directory. Something like:
"find /var/lib/mysql -type d -printf "%D %i %p\n"

bye,

-christian-
```

[17 Jul 2008 5:35]
Devin Carraway
```
If you're trying to protect the mysql data directory and its descendants, then you can do so with a stat() call on that directory, then on each component of the user-supplied index/data directory path (hence for /tmp/foo/bar: /tmp, /tmp/foo, /tmp/foo/bar).  If any of the supplied path's ancestors or the path itself match the mysql data dir, then the user has supplied a path in or under it.  This would not protect databases with data/index dirs outside the mysql root -- for that you'd have to check for a nonempty intersection between the inodes of the components of the user-supplied path and those of each data/index dir used by every other database within that mysqld.

There are a number of potential race conditions in such a check, though they apply equally to a path-based readlink() or realpath() check as well.  Essentially, if mysqld creates the table's data files under a user-controlled path after checking for its validity, then you're not guaranteed that the path used for the create is the same one you checked.  For an attacker trying to exploit the race condition, the odds aren't too shabby, and they can retry as many times as they like until they succeed.

Since there isn't an atomic stat-directory-and-open-file-therein system call in UNIX, to avoid the race may require an ownership-based lstat() check as well, to assure that there aren't any components of the path writable by users other than mysqld's own and root.  And the operation might need to be performed under a global lock so as to protect against races with table storage paths as well.  It sucks, but it might be the price of admission for a feature like this one.
```

[17 Jul 2008 7:33]
Sergei Golubchik
```
So far we're still implementing readlink/realpath solution.

For a bind mounts, for example, we say that it's DBA problem - in particular, if he has made two different paths /a/b/c/d and /e/f/g/h to refer to the same file, he himself needs to make sure that one of these paths is unreadable for mysql user (user, mysqld is running as), e.g. set permissions on c/ directory appropriately.

A simple solution to fix races is to check a path with a realpath, and then use the *expanded* , "real" path to access a file, not the original one.

      [Bug#32167](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32167) another privilege bypass with DATA/INDEX DIRECTORY.

      test_if_data_home_dir fixed to look into real path.
      Checks added to mi_open for symlinks into data home directory.
```

[18 Jul 2008 7:43]
Devin Carraway
```
Sorry I didn't get to this earlier, but using realpath()'s return value won't work either if the attacker controls any of the components of the (real) path.  Here's a PoC illustrating why, using a mysqld patched to use a realpath() call.  At the time the test_if_data_home_dir() check is run, the path given involves no symlinks at all and does not refer to the mysql data dir.  But by the time the table's files are actually created, the path now includes a symlink to another database's data directory, and the files end up there.

Starting conditions were two empty databases, test1 and test2, with a user allowed to create in t1 but not in t2, and a root user that can create in t2.

First, as the test user:

[etch-amd64] aqua@kesha:/tmp
$ rm -rf directory && umask 0 && mkdir directory && ls -ld directory
drwxrwxrwx 2 aqua 1000 1024 Jul 18 07:17 directory
[etch-amd64] aqua@kesha:/tmp
$ mysql -p test1
Enter password:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 6
Server version: 5.0.32-Debian_7etch6-log Debian etch distribution

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> create table t1 (a int) data directory '/tmp/directory/' index directory '/tmp/directory/' ;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)

mysql>
[1]+  Stopped                 mysql -p test1
[etch-amd64] aqua@kesha:/tmp
$ mysql -p test1
[etch-amd64] aqua@kesha:/tmp
$ rm -rf directory && ln -s /var/lib/mysql/test2 directory && ls -ld directory
lrwxrwxrwx 1 aqua 1000 20 Jul 18 07:17 directory -> /var/lib/mysql/test2

Then, as the root user, in the test2 db:

mysql> create table t1 (a int) ;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)

And as the test user, back in test1:

mysql> insert into t1 values (1),(2),(3) ;
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

Finally, over in test2:

mysql> select * from t1 ;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

Sorry I didn't think of that earlier.  Finally, keep in mind that realpath() isn't atomic -- it's an iteration over lstat() and readlink(); if part of it is replaced with a symlink after the iteration has passed that part, realpath() won't tell you:

00:37:31.512490 getcwd("/tmp"..., 4096) = 5 <0.000016>
00:37:31.512581 lstat("/tmp/a", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=1024, ...}) = 0 <0.000019>
/* inject rename("a", "a.old"); symlink("/var/lib/mysql", "a"); */
00:37:31.512706 lstat("/tmp/a/b", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=1024, ...}) = 0 <0.000017>
```

[18 Jul 2008 7:48]
Devin Carraway
```
BTW, reading over that checkin, by putting a realpath check into the open call you narrow the window of vulnerability considerably -- just keep in mind that symlinks can be anywhere in a path, while lstat() only checks the last component.
```

[18 Jul 2008 8:44]
Sergei Golubchik
```
Right, that's precisely why we moved the check to the place where a file is *opened*, not where it's *created* - to stop attacks like the one you described.

For the record, here's a summary history of fixes for this bug:

* Original fix applied to 4.1.24, 5.0.60, 5.1.24, 6.0.5
* Secondary fix applied to 4.1.25, 5.0.70, 5.1.28, 6.0.6
* Original fix applied to first Community release following 5.0.60 (i.e., 5.0.67)
* Original + secondary fixes applied to 5.0.66sp1 Service Pack release

Description for the secondary fix:

Additional corrections were made for the symlink-related privilege
problem originally addressed. The original fix did not correctly
handle the data directory pathname if it contained symlinked
directories in its path, and the check was made only at
table-creation time, not at table-opening time later.

reopened, the fix had a bug: in mysqld.cc, fix_paths() mysql_unpacked_real_data_home was calculated from mysql_real_data_home *before* mysql_real_data_home itself was expanded. For example when mysql_real_data_home was specified as a relative path, mysql_unpacked_real_data_home was interpreting it relatively to a pwd(), not to a mysql_home.

Can anyone confirm that "Fixed a initialization order remark by Serg" fix is what is referred to in 5.1.41 release notes (and also in .24 and .28 as "additional fix in .41")?  The fix is committed in 5.1 bazaar branch:

<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~mysql/mysql-server/mysql-5.1/revision/1810.3967.4>

but it does not seem to have made it to 5.1.41.  Am I missing some other change?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
