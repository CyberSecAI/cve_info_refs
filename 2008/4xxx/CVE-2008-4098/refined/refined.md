{
  "CVE-2008-4098": {
    "Root cause": "A symlink traversal vulnerability exists in MySQL, where the server does not properly validate paths when creating tables with DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY options, allowing an attacker to bypass access controls.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper symlink handling",
      "Insufficient path validation",
      "Bypass of access controls"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with CREATE TABLE privileges and shell access on the database server can bypass MySQL access controls and write to tables in databases they would not normally have access to.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local exploitation via creation of a table using the DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY options with paths containing symlinks to other database directories."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker requires CREATE TABLE privileges for at least one database and the ability to execute shell commands on the database server."
  }
