Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `products.php` script. Specifically, the `id` parameter within the `products.php` URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`id` parameter in `products.php`) before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords. In the provided example, the attacker extracts `username` and `password` from the `bb1_users` table using `concat(username,0x3a,password)`.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** Depending on the database permissions and the application's functionality, an attacker could potentially modify or delete data, or even gain further access to the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `products.php` script, modifying the `id` parameter.
    *   Vulnerable URL Example: `http://1st-scripts.de/products.php?id=00+union+select+1,concat(username,0x3a,password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19+from+bb1_users--`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the target server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax to craft a successful injection payload.

**Additional Details**
* The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique to retrieve the username and password from the database.

This information is consistent with the CVE description of a SQL injection vulnerability.
