Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-4711:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the application fails to neutralize special elements used in SQL commands (SQL Injection). This occurs when the PHP setting `magic_quotes_gpc` is disabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (CWE-89). The application is directly incorporating user input into SQL queries without proper validation or escaping.
- **Multiple vulnerable files:** The vulnerability is present in multiple PHP files including view.blog.php, view.event.php, view.group.php, view.music.php, view.picture.php, and view.video.php, indicating a widespread lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information, including usernames and passwords from the `joovili_users` and `joovili_admins` tables, as shown in the provided exploits.
- **Integrity Impact:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database, since arbitrary SQL statements can be executed.
- **Availability Impact:** Exploiting the vulnerability could potentially lead to denial-of-service by manipulating the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacks are conducted using HTTP GET requests, by modifying the `id` parameter in the URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker does not need local access and can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication.
- **`magic_quotes_gpc` Off:** The attacker needs the PHP configuration option `magic_quotes_gpc` to be disabled on the server for the SQL injection to be successful.
- **Medium Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is considered medium, which indicates that it might take some specialized knowledge or effort to exploit.

**Technical Details**
- The provided exploits demonstrate how to use `UNION SELECT` statements to extract sensitive data from the `joovili_users` and `joovili_admins` tables.
- The `concat_ws` function is used to concatenate the username and password, separated by a colon.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Joovili version 3.0 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was discovered on August 27, 2008.
- There are references to other advisories on SecurityFocus and milw0rm.
- The CVSS score is 6.8/10 with exploitability subscore of 8.6 and impact subscore of 6.4, meaning the vulnerability is reasonably easy to exploit with potential significant impact.
