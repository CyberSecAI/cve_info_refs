{
  "CVE-2008-4591": {
    "Description": "PhpWebGallery 1.3.4 has multiple vulnerabilities including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Local File Inclusion (LFI).",
    "Root cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to XSS and allows access to local files by manipulating request parameters.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser through XSS, potentially leading to session hijacking or defacement. Additionally, LFI can allow attackers to read sensitive files on the server.",
    "Attack vectors": {
       "XSS": "Crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript code embedded in the `lang` parameter, specifically `lang[access_forbiden]` and `lang[ident_title]` in `admin/include/isadmin.inc.php`.",
       "LFI": "Manipulating `user[language]` and `user[template]` parameters within vulnerable PHP files (`include/init.inc.php` and `include/isadmin.inc.php`) to include arbitrary files."
     },
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft malicious URLs and induce a user to open them, or, with LFI, simply access the crafted URL. No special privileges are required, however, the attack is remote."
