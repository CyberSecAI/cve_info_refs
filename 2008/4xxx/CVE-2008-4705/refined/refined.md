Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4705:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `success_story.php` file of the "My PHP Dating" application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `success_story.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive data from the database, including:
    - Database version and name.
    - User credentials (specifically, the `m_pass` and `admin_id` from the `baq_admin` table).
- The ability to manipulate or delete data is also possible with SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP GET request to the `success_story.php` script.
- The `id` parameter is used to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- No authentication is required for exploitation, since the vulnerability resides in a publicly accessible page.
- The attacker does not require any special permissions within the application.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how an attacker could use a `UNION SELECT` statement in the `id` parameter to bypass the application's intended query and inject their own malicious SQL code.
- Example exploit URLs:
    - `http://www.site.com/success_story.php?id=-2+union+select+1,2,concat(@@version,0x3e,database())--` (Retrieves database version and name).
    - `http://www.phponlinedatingsoftware.com/demo/success_story.php?id=-2+union+select+1,2,concat(m_pass,0x3e,admin_id)+from+infowar1_cms.baq_admin--` (Retrieves admin passwords and IDs).
