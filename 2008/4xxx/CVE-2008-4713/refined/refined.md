Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4713

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `view.php` file of the 212cafe Board application. Specifically, the `qID` parameter in the URL is directly incorporated into an SQL query without adequate escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. The application does not sanitize user-supplied input in the `qID` parameter before using it in an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Failure to sanitize user-controlled input is the fundamental weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and potentially other information stored within the application's database.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** The attacker might also be able to modify or delete data within the database if the database user has sufficient privileges.
- **Complete System Compromise (Potentially):** In some cases, an SQL injection can be used to gain more access to the server or other components, leading to a complete system compromise, if the database user has sufficient privileges to use system functions, or if used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `view.php` file, with a manipulated `qID` parameter that injects malicious SQL code.
- **Remote:** This vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable 212cafe Board application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker must have a good understanding of SQL to craft malicious injection payloads that can exploit the application vulnerability.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without the attacker needing to authenticate to the application.
- **Magic Quotes Off:** The exploit requires the web server's magic quotes setting to be turned off to prevent backslashes from interfering with the SQL injection payload.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability lies in the following line within `view.php`:

```php
$query="SELECT * FROM board_question WHERE (qID='$qID')";
```

The attacker can manipulate the `qID` parameter (e.g., `?qID=-9999')/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/1,concat(mUser,0x3a3a,mPasswd),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16/**/FROM/**/board_member/**/WHERE/**/(mID='1`) to inject SQL code. This specific example attempts to extract usernames and passwords from the `board_member` table.

This exploit is remote, does not require authentication and has a high severity rating.
