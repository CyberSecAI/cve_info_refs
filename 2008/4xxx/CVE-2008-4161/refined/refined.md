Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `search_inv.php` file of AssetMan v2.5-b, specifically within the handling of the `order_by` GET parameter. This parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection and can be manipulated to inject a META tag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The `order_by` GET variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Session Fixation:** By injecting a META tag, an attacker can manipulate the cookies stored in a user's browser. This can be used to set a session ID before a user logs in, effectively hijacking their session after login.
*   **Meta Tag Exploitation:** The application does not prevent the injection of malicious META tags through user-controlled input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can fix a user's session ID, thereby gaining unauthorized access to their account after the user logs in, without needing to steal their session ID after authentication.
*   **Data Breaches:** Through SQL injection, an attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete data within the application's database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The attack can be carried out remotely over the network by crafting a malicious URL.
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through a manipulated GET request to `search_inv.php`, specifically targeting the `order_by` variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **Basic Knowledge of HTML/HTTP:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft a malicious META tag for session fixation.
*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft a SQL injection string to be executed by the server.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability is located in `search_inv.php`.
* The vulnerable parameter is `order_by` which is a GET request.
* The attack involves injecting a META tag within the `order_by` parameter using URL encoding.
* Example payload is provided: `http://127.0.0.1/assetman/search_inv.php?action=search_all&order_by=%3Cmeta+http-equiv='Set-cookie'+content='=value'%3E&order=DESC+limit+1,1--`
* The `Set-cookie` header is injected to manipulate session information.
* The injection is combined with SQL query manipulation (`order=DESC+limit+1,1--`) to extract data.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-89 (SQL Injection).
*   The CVSS base score is 6.8/10, with exploitability subscore of 8.6/10 and impact subscore of 6.4/10
*   Vulnerable software is AssetMan v2.5-b
