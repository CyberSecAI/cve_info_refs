Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `page` parameter of the `index.php` script. The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `pageid` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of proper input sanitization in the `page` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Database compromise:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server. This could lead to:
    - **Data theft:** Access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    - **Data modification:** Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    - **Privilege escalation:** Potentially gaining administrative access to the database server.
- **Partial confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact**: as stated in the securityreason.com article.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted GET request to `index.php` where the `page` parameter is used to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere with network access to the vulnerable application.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
- **Basic web interaction skills**: The attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to inject a query that retrieves the database version and current user. The vulnerability can be accessed with the following URL: `http://[t4rg3t]/[p4th]/index.php?page=DBpAGE&pageid=-1'+union+select+version(),user()/*`.
- The vulnerability affects Zanfi CMS lite / Jaw Portal free.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Cru3l.b0y.
