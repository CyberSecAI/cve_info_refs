Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization within specific functionalities of Movable Type. This leads to multiple vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Improper input escaping in some parts of the application allows the injection of arbitrary scripts.
    *   Incorrect handling of character encoding in certain older browsers may lead to XSS.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Some parts of the application are vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts within a user's browser, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or deface the website.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of an authenticated user if they can trick the user into submitting a malicious request.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:**  Attackers can inject malicious scripts via user-controlled input fields or parameters. The specific vulnerable functions or parameters are not detailed in the provided text.
*   **CSRF:** Attackers can exploit CSRF by crafting malicious links or forms that trick authenticated users into submitting unintended requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **XSS:** Attackers need to be able to inject malicious scripts into a vulnerable part of the application, usually through user input fields or crafted links.
*   **CSRF:** Attackers need to be able to entice a user who is logged into the Movable Type application to click a malicious link or submit a crafted form.
