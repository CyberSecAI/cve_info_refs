# Opera: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200811-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Opera, allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/opera** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.62** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.62** |

### Background

Opera is a fast web browser that is available free of charge.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Opera:

* Opera does not restrict the ability of a framed web page to change
  the address associated with a different frame (CVE-2008-4195).
* Chris Weber (Casaba Security) discovered a Cross-site scripting
  vulnerability (CVE-2008-4196).
* Michael A. Puls II discovered
  that Opera can produce argument strings that contain uninitialized
  memory, when processing custom shortcut and menu commands
  (CVE-2008-4197).
* Lars Kleinschmidt discovered that Opera, when
  rendering an HTTP page that has loaded an HTTPS page into a frame,
  displays a padlock icon and offers a security information dialog
  reporting a secure connection (CVE-2008-4198).
* Opera does not
  prevent use of links from web pages to feed source files on the local
  disk (CVE-2008-4199).
* Opera does not ensure that the address
  field of a news feed represents the feed's actual URL
  (CVE-2008-4200).
* Opera does not check the CRL override upon
  encountering a certificate that lacks a CRL (CVE-2008-4292).
* Chris (Matasano Security) reported that Opera may crash if it is
  redirected by a malicious page to a specially crafted address
  (CVE-2008-4694).
* Nate McFeters reported that Opera runs Java
  applets in the context of the local machine, if that applet has been
  cached and a page can predict the cache path for that applet and load
  it from the cache (CVE-2008-4695).
* Roberto Suggi Liverani
  (Security-Assessment.com) reported that Opera's History Search results
  does not escape certain constructs correctly, allowing for the
  injection of scripts into the page (CVE-2008-4696).
* David
  Bloom reported that Opera's Fast Forward feature incorrectly executes
  scripts from a page held in a frame in the outermost page instead of
  the page the JavaScript URL was located (CVE-2008-4697).
* David
  Bloom reported that Opera does not block some scripts when previewing a
  news feed (CVE-2008-4698).
* Opera does not correctly sanitize
  content when certain parameters are passed to Opera's History Search,
  allowing scripts to be injected into the History Search results page
  (CVE-2008-4794).
* Opera's links panel incorrectly causes
  scripts from a page held in a frame to be executed in the outermost
  page instead of the page where the URL was located
  (CVE-2008-4795).

### Impact

These vulnerabilties allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code,
to run scripts injected into Opera's History Search with elevated
privileges, to inject arbitrary web script or HTML into web pages, to
manipulate the address bar, to change Opera's preferences, to determine
the validity of local filenames, to read cache files, browsing history,
and subscribed feeds or to conduct other attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-9.62"
```

Subject: Re: CVE request: Opera < 9.52 multiple vulnerabilities

CVEs to be filled in later.

CVE-2008-4195 Sites can change framed content on other sites
CVE-2008-4196 cross-site scripting
CVE-2008-4197 Custom shortcuts
CVE-2008-4198 insecure pages show incorrect security information
CVE-2008-4199 Feed links can link to local files
CVE-2008-4200 feed subscription can cause the wrong page address to be displayed

Can anyone parse this statement: "Fixed a problem with the CRL
override for certificates that do not have a CRL specified: Override
was not checked."  Is this a security issue, or just a bug in a
security mechanism?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-20 14:59:27 UTC  ``` Ignoring [bug #195386](show_bug.cgi?id=195386 "RESOLVED FIXED - www-client/opera <9.5 Remote DNS rebinding attack vulnerability (CVE-2007-5276)") and [bug #231830](show_bug.cgi?id=231830 "RESOLVED OBSOLETE - www-client/opera \"Cross-Site Cooking\" Session Hijacking (CVE-2008-3172)") for the moment, we're almost ready to stabilise.  * Sites can no longer change framed content on other sites: see our advisory[1] * Fixed an issue that could allow cross-site scripting, as reported by Chris Weber of Casaba Security: details will be disclosed at a later date * Custom shortcuts no longer pass the wrong parameters to applications, as reported by Michael A. Puls II: see our advisory[2] * Prevented insecure pages from showing incorrect security information, as reported by Lars Kleinschmidt: see our advisory[3] * Feed links can no longer link to local files: see our advisory[4] * Feed subscription can no longer cause the wrong page address to be displayed: see our advisory[5]  [1] <http://www.opera.com/support/search/view/893/> [2] <http://www.opera.com/support/search/view/894/> [3] <http://www.opera.com/support/search/view/895/> [4] <http://www.opera.com/support/search/view/896/> [5] <http://www.opera.com/support/search/view/897/> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-20 15:06:51 UTC  ``` An ebuild is in the tree and the package.mask entry has been removed. Feel free to proceed with stabilisation. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-20 22:34:15 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable: =www-client/opera-9.52 Target keywords : "amd64 ppc sparc x86" ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-20 22:38:06 UTC  ``` i know, no sparc :-) ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-21 21:35:11 UTC  ``` I don't think I can agree to this bug's Severity being "minor".  * Sites can no longer change framed content on other sites [...] - Highly Severe * Fixed an issue that could allow cross-site scripting [...] - [as yet unknown] * Custom shortcuts no longer pass the wrong parameters to applications [...] - Moderately Severe * Prevented insecure pages from showing incorrect security information [...] - Less Severe * Feed links can no longer link to local files [...] - Less Severe * Feed subscription can no longer cause the wrong page address to be displayed [...] - Not Severe  The first of them should warrant expedient stabilisation and a matching Severity setting on this bug report. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Dawid Węgliński (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-22 00:08:29 UTC  ``` Stable flash stoped working in opera-9.52 here on amd64. :( ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Dawid Węgliński (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-22 00:25:07 UTC  ``` Okay, had to remerge netscape-flash. :) amd64 stable  I agree about the severity thing.

The severity is a direct result of the status B3 ('Global service compromise: denial of service, passwords or full database leaks'), please refer to section 3 of the vulnerability treatment policy for details: <http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/vulnerability-policy.xml#doc_chap3>  Any higher rating (B1/B2) would mean that an attacker could leverage any of these vulnerability to execute code with or without user assistance. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-22 17:55:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=235298#c7)) > Stable on x86  Please read <http://devmanual.gentoo.org/keywording/> to find out what "stable on x86" means in Gentoo parlance.

CVE-2008-4196 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-4196>):   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Opera before 9.52 allows   remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via   unspecified vectors.  CVE-2008-4197 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-4197>):   Opera before 9.52 on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris, when   processing custom shortcut and menu commands, can produce argument   strings that contain uninitialized memory, which might allow   user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or conduct   other attacks via vectors related to activation of a shortcut.  CVE-2008-4198 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-4198>):   Opera before 9.52, when rendering an http page that has loaded an   https page into a frame, displays a padlock icon and offers a   security information dialog reporting a secure connection, which   might allow remote attackers to trick a user into performing unsafe   actions on the http page.  CVE-2008-4199 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-4199>):   Opera before 9.52 does not prevent use of links from web pages to   feed source files on the local disk, which might allow remote   attackers to determine the validity of local filenames via vectors   involving "detection of JavaScript events and appropriate   manipulation."  CVE-2008-4200 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-4200>):   Opera before 9.52 does not ensure that the address field of a news   feed represents the feed's actual URL, which allows remote attackers   to change this field to display the URL of a page containing web   script controlled by the attacker.  CVE-2008-4292 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-4292>):   Opera before 9.52 does not check the CRL override upon encountering a   certificate that lacks a CRL, which has unknown impact and attack   vectors.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this is a vulnerability, but   the vendor included it in a security section of the advisory.   ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Tobias Heinlein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-11-03 19:01:36 UTC  ``` GLSA 200811-01, thanks everyone and sorry about the delay. ``` |  |
