{
  "cveId": "CVE-2008-4198",
  "description": "Opera before 9.52, when rendering an http page that has loaded an https page into a frame, displays a padlock icon and offers a security information dialog reporting a secure connection, which might allow remote attackers to trick a user into performing unsafe actions on the http page.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The browser incorrectly displays a secure connection indicator (padlock icon) when an HTTP page loads an HTTPS page within a frame.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent security indicators",
      "Lack of proper verification of the top-level page's security context"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can trick users into believing a non-secure HTTP page is actually secure, potentially leading to unsafe actions (e.g., submitting sensitive information) on the HTTP page.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A malicious HTTP page loading a legitimate HTTPS page in a frame."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker only needs the ability to host a webpage to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is present because Opera does not properly verify that the top-level page is HTTPS, even if an iframe is loaded from an HTTPS url."
  }
