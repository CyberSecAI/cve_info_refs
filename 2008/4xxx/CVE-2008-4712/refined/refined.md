```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `showblog.php` script in LnBlog 0.9.0 directly includes a file specified by the `plugin` GET parameter without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Local File Inclusion (LFI).
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include arbitrary local files on the server, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) or execution of malicious code if the attacker can upload a PHP file to the server.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL with a `plugin` parameter that includes a file path, the attacker can force the server to include the specified file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
