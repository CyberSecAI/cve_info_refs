Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-4697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is related to Opera's "Fast Forward" feature. The vulnerability lies in how this feature handles JavaScript URLs within frames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is that the "Fast Forward" feature incorrectly executes scripts from a page held in a frame within the outermost page's context.  This is a form of XSS, where the script is executed in a different domain than it was intended for.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code, which then executes in the context of the main page due to the incorrect execution context of the Fast Forward feature. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** Attackers can host a malicious web page containing an iframe or frame with a javascript URL. When a user interacts with the "Fast Forward" feature, the script from the framed page could be executed in the context of the outermost page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker needs to host a web page that can be accessed by a user of a vulnerable Opera browser.
*   **No Direct Access:** The attacker does not require direct access to the user's system, only the ability to have the user visit a malicious page using the vulnerable Opera browser.

**Summary**

The vulnerability stems from how Opera's Fast Forward feature incorrectly executes JavaScript URLs originating from a framed page in the context of the main page leading to Cross Site Scripting. By hosting a webpage with a malicious frame, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code in the user's browser by leveraging this vulnerability in Opera's Fast Forward feature.
