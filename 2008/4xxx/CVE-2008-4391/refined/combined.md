## Linksys WVC54GC NetCamPlayerWeb11gv2 ActiveX control stack buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#639345

Original Release Date: 2008-12-05 | Last Revised: 2008-12-05

---

### Overview

The Linksys WVC54GC NetCamPlayerWeb11gv2 ActiveX control contains a stack buffer overflow, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Linksys WVC54GC wireless video camera provides an ActiveX control called NetCamPlayerWeb11gv2, which is provided by the file NetCamPlayerWeb11gv2.ocx. This ActiveX control contains a stack buffer overflow in the SetSource() method. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause Internet Explorer (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This vulnerability is addressed in [WVC54GC firmware version 1.25](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Download_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115417109974&packedargs=sku%3D1134691947479&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper). Please see the [release notes](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheadername1=Content-Type&blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&blobheadervalue1=text%2Fplain&blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3DWVC54GC-V1.0_non-RoHS-v1.25_fw_ver.txt&blobkey=id&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1193776031728&ssbinary=true&lid=8104724130B17) for more details. Note that any client system that has installed the ActiveX control must connect to the camera and install the updated control. |
| --- |

| **Disable the** **NetCamPlayerWeb11gv2** **ActiveX control in Internet Explorer**The vulnerable ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID:{D7208880-9B7A-43E1-AABB-8C888A5704F9}More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D7208880-9B7A-43E1-AABB-8C888A5704F9}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400**Disable ActiveX**Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the "[Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer)" document. |
