{
  "CVE-2008-4720": {
    "Description": "The Gemini Portal 4.7 suffers from a remote file inclusion vulnerability. This is due to the 'lang' parameter not being properly sanitized when included in bottom.php and category.php. An attacker can exploit this by including a malicious remote file.",
    "Root cause": "The application uses the 'lang' parameter in the include() function without sanitizing it, allowing for the inclusion of arbitrary files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests. By crafting a URL containing the vulnerable script and pointing the 'lang' parameter to a malicious file hosted on an attacker controlled server.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and host a malicious file on a reachable server. No specific position within the network is required beyond general reachability"
