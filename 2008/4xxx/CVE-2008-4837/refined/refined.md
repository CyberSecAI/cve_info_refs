      "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Word. Exploitation requires that the attacker coerce the target into opening a malicious .DOC file.  The specific flaw exists when processing a malformed table property within a Microsoft Word document. User-supplied data is copied into a stack-based buffer using a size that is calculated from the contents of the property. Exploitation can result in arbitrary code execution under the context of the current user.",

The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Word file that includes a malformed record value. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of an affected system in the context of the current logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
