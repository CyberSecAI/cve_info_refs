```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A modification in the UTImageServer component of the uWeb server in Unreal Tournament 3 version 1.3 removed the restriction on file extensions that could be downloaded.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Directory traversal vulnerability. The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to use "../" sequences to navigate outside the intended directory and access arbitrary files on the server's file system.
- Impact of exploitation: An unauthenticated attacker can remotely download sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files containing the admin password, potentially leading to complete compromise of the game server and the system it's running on.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exposed through the uWeb server's HTTP interface. An attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the server's /images/ path with directory traversal sequences in the filename parameter to access files outside of the images folder.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
