===============
1) Introduction
===============

Unreal Tournament 3 (UT3) is the latest game of the famous homonim
series developed by Epic Games (http://www.epicgames.com).

#######################################################################

======
2) Bug
======

UT3, as any other game based on the Unreal engine, has an internal web
server called uWeb for controlling the own server remotely using a web
browser.
This interface is disabled by default and in the case of UT3 are needed
the additional files located on http://ut3webadmin.elmuerte.com (choice
made by Epic for fixing possibly issues more quickly).

In the last 1.3 patch released the 13th August 2008 has been made a bad
and unusual modification to uWeb.
In fact the WebAdmin component is composed by two sub components/classes
called UTServerAdmin (used for everything) and UTImageServer used only
for the handling of the HTTP requests for the files in the /images
folder.

In the script of the ImageServer component in version 1.3 has been made
the following change which has removed the limitation of downloading
only files with the extentions JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP and PNG:

ImageServer.uc of version 1.2:
    ...
    else
    {
        Response.HTTPError(404);
        return;
    }
    Response.IncludeBinaryFile( Path $ Image );

ImageServer.uc of version 1.3:
    ...
    else
    {
        Response.SendStandardHeaders("application/octet-stream", true);
    }
    Response.IncludeBinaryFile( Path $ Image );

Not a so dangerous thing except that the directory traversal which has
EVER affected this part of the engine and which has never been possible
to exploit due to the filters on the extensions of the requested files
(an image can't be classified as "sensible" data moreover if there is
no way to know the exact locations of these files) now allows any
external unauthenticated attacker to download files from the system.

In fact when a file is requested the engine first looks in the home
folder of the user who has launched the UT3 server (for example
"C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\My Games\Unreal
Tournament 3") because the configuration files used by the server are
located just there and then in the folder of the game, so having the
server installed on another partition doesn't limit the problem.

For example, it's enough to request the file
"/images/../../UTGame/Config/UTGame.INI" to see all the configuration
of the server which includes also the admin password to gain access to
the same webadmin interface.
In the example I have used the INI extension instead of ini because
this particular extension seems filtered internally so it's enough to
use one or more upper case chars in it to bypass the check while there
are no strange behaviours for the other extensions or files.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Downloading: version 1.17

If the download does not start within 5 seconds, [click here](/files/UT3WebAdmin-1.17_2009-09-13.zip) to download the latest release.

*Note:* this version requires Unreal Tournament 3 patched to version **2.1** (engine version 3805) or later.

### Changelog

```

v1.17 - 2009-09-13 (requires UT3 2.1)
-------------------------------------
- fixes the issue where changes to game profile disappeared when a new map
  was loaded.
- made some changes to the way the menu permissions are validated, the
  urls used for AJAX requests are now dependent to their base url. This
  addresses issues #74, #75

v1.16 - 2009-07-30 (requires UT3 2.1)
-------------------------------------
- added a warning when the localization file is corrupt. This causes missing
  menus.
- changed the method of detecting active mutators
- added functionality to configure server actors

v1.15 - 2009-05-17 (requires UT3 2.1)
-------------------------------------
- fixed a few typos
- added a setting to validate the IP in sessions. This increases security by
  making sessions less prone to hijacking.
- added a basic translit system which allows conversion for certain information.
  this can be used to convert Cyrillic characters to their ASCII equivalent.
  This translit system is also used by the chatlog. See the file
  Localization/RUS/WebAdmin.rus how you should build your translit table.
  The translit system is needed because the webadmin can only produce ASCII (or
  UTF-8) output. Internally UE3 uses UTF-16, which can not be used by the
  webadmin.
  Note: The translit system is not used for input processing.
  Note: Because the tanslit table is stored in a localization file you need to
  have the appropriate Language set in UTEngine.ini or you have to manually
  copy the table to WebAdmin.int
- made all text localized, people can now localize the WebAdmin if they feel
  like it. To localize the HTML files define the HTMLSubDirectory localized
  variable, and create the proper files in the Web/WebAdmin/??? directory.
  Note: the <!-- #include ... --> files are not transparently handled.
- Don't send gzip encoded files to Safari browsers, they lies about supporting
  gzip encoded files (or at least, for javascript)
- various browser tweaks

v1.14.0 - 2009-04-05 (for UT3 2.0)
v1.14.1 - 2009-04-05 (for UT3 2.1)
----------------------------------
- added support to dynamically add skins to the webadmin. To register a skin
  simply create an .ini file in the Config directory with the following content
    [SomeName WebAdminSkin]
    FriendlyName=My Own Skins
    CssFile=/images/myskin/main.css
- added option to /current/bots to add an arbitrary number of bots
- added a system settings page to change webadmin settins
- reduced loading of gametype classes to filter the mutator lists, this reduces
  loading of additional packages during the game (which clients would need to
  download). You can force rebuild of the caches by visiting this (hidden) page:
  http://<webadmin.ip>/ServerAdmin/system/allowancecache
  http://<webadmin.ip>/ServerAdmin/system/settingscache
  (note: this is something you might want to do after installing new or
  upgrading gametypes/mutators)

v1.13 - 2009-03-22
------------------
Note: Patch 2.1 is required
- filter duplicate gamemode/maps/mutator registrations (check the log file for
  detections).
- fixed XHTML comppliance issues for all pages
- added tooltips to the settings pages with additional information about the
  settings.
- added "Max Replay Limit" setting to the map list editor

v1.12 - 2009-03-09
------------------
- fixed unsaved settings bKickMissingCDHashKeys, TimeToWaitForHashKey
- fixed "No Custom Characters" showing up as a number field
- fixed bug #0000065: Score Limit setting appears twice
- should no longer disable "achievements"

- fixed an accessed none in the chat log functionality
- added the setting to disable seamless level loading:
    Settings > General > Administration > Disable seamless loading

v1.10 - 2009-02-28
------------------
- added an game engine check at webadmin startup
- some minor adjustments
- added text/voice muting to /current/player page. Note: voice muting is a
  force action to all clients. This means that a forced unmute removes the
  client's own mute action.

v1.9 - 2009-02-20
-----------------
Note: Patch 2.0 is required
- added sessionban functionality
- added spawn protection time setting for gametypes

v1.1 - 2008-04-06
-----------------
- fixed mutator filtering for gametypes
- Admin* console commands are now supported in the management console
- Changed the login form to allow different timeouts. "Till next map load" was
  the previous behavior when you didn't check "remember me". In now defaults to
  "session" which will remember the authentication for the browser session.
  This does not apply when using bHttpAuth
- fixed saving of various elements of the general settings

v1.0 - 2008-03-24
-----------------
- various small performance fixes:
  - Mutator\Gametype settings pages load faster and use less memory
- fixed issue where the messaging spectator is registered with the online
  subsystem resulting in a server crash during the level switch GC.

#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
Unreal Tournament 3 (UT3) is the latest game of the famous homonim
series developed by Epic Games (http://www.epicgames.com).
#######################################################################
======
2) Bug
======
UT3, as any other game based on the Unreal engine, has an internal web
server called uWeb for controlling the own server remotely using a web
browser.
This interface is disabled by default and in the case of UT3 are needed
the additional files located on http://ut3webadmin.elmuerte.com (choice
made by Epic for fixing possible issues more quickly without creating
new patches for the whole game).
In the last 1.3 patch released the 13th August 2008 has been made a bad
and unusual modification to uWeb.
In fact the WebAdmin component is composed by two sub components/classes
called UTServerAdmin (used for everything) and UTImageServer used only
for the handling of the HTTP requests for the files in the /images
folder.
In the script of the ImageServer component in version 1.3 has been made
the following change which has removed the limitation of downloading
only files with the extentions JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP and PNG:
ImageServer.uc of version 1.2:
...
else
{
Response.HTTPError(404);
return;
}
Response.IncludeBinaryFile( Path $ Image );
ImageServer.uc of version 1.3:
...
else
{
Response.SendStandardHeaders("application/octet-stream", true);
}
Response.IncludeBinaryFile( Path $ Image );
Not a so dangerous thing except that the directory traversal which has
EVER affected this part of the engine and which has never been possible
to exploit due to the filters on the extensions of the requested files
(an image can't be classified as "sensible" data moreover if there is
no way to know the exact locations of these files) now allows any
external unauthenticated attacker to download files from the system.
In fact when a file is requested the engine first looks in the home
folder of the user who has launched the UT3 server (for example
"C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\My Games\Unreal
Tournament 3") because the configuration files used by the server are
located just there and then in the folder of the game, so having the
server installed on another partition doesn't limit the problem.
For example, it's enough to request the file
"/images/../../UTGame/Config/UTGame.INI" to see all the configuration
of the server which includes also the admin password to gain access to
the same webadmin interface.
In the example I have used the INI extension instead of ini because
this particular extension seems filtered internally so it's enough to
use one or more upper case chars in it to bypass the check while there
are no strange behaviours for the other extensions or files.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
