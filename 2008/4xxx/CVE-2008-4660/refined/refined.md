The provided content is related to CVE-2008-4660.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple third-party TYPO3 extensions contained SQL injection vulnerabilities or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection:  JobControl (dmmjobcontrol), Econda Plugin (econda), Frontend Users View (feusersview), Mannschaftsliste (kiddog\_playerlist), M1 Intern (m1\_intern), and Simple survey (simplesurvey) extensions were vulnerable to SQL injection.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Page Improvements (sm_pageimprovements) extension was vulnerable to XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- SQL Injection: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
- XSS: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, redirection, or defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities could be exploited through web requests targeting specific parameters within the vulnerable TYPO3 extensions.
- Specific details for each extension are not provided but the general idea is that malicious input could be injected into the requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send malicious requests to the affected TYPO3 system. This likely requires a network connection to the server and an understanding of how to interact with the specific vulnerable extension.
