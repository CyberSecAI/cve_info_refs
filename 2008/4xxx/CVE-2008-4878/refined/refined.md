Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2008-4878:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the admin login page of WebCards versions 1.3 and prior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the username field on the admin login page, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to bypass the login authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the administration area of the WebCards application.
*   **Remote Shell Access:** After gaining access to the admin panel, the attacker can upload a shell (e.g., a PHP script) by using the "Add Image Macro" feature and then uploading the file through the "Images" section. This allows arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP:** The attack is performed via HTTP requests to the admin login page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WebCards instance.
*   **Knowledge of Default Username:** The attacker needs to know or guess a valid username (e.g., "admin").
*  **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection to exploit the vulnerability using a crafted username.

**Technical Details:**
*   The exploit uses the following SQL injection payload in the username field: `admin" and ""="`
* The password field can have any arbitrary value.
