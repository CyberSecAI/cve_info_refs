  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-4662",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `admin.php` file of LokiCMS version 0.3.4. The application includes a language file based on user-supplied input from the `language` parameter without proper sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
        "Insufficient Input Validation",
        "Path Traversal"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files from the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as the `/etc/passwd` file or configuration files.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `admin.php` file with a crafted `language` parameter."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable LokiCMS application. No authentication is required for this specific vulnerability, but the `magic_quotes_gpc` must be turned off.",
     "additional_details": "The exploit uses the `LWP::UserAgent` Perl module to send a POST request to `admin.php` with a `LokiACTION` parameter set to `A_SAVE_G_SETTINGS` and a `language` parameter set to a path traversal string, such as '../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00'. The null byte (%00) is used to truncate the file path, avoiding issues if the application appends additional characters. The vulnerability is triggered by the include statement within `admin.php` that takes the `language` parameter and uses it to include a language file, without sanitizing the user input."
