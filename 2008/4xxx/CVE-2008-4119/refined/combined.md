How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Title: CA Service Desk Multiple Cross-Site Scripting
Vulnerabilities
CA Advisory Date: 2008-09-24
Reported By:
Open Security Foundation
Impact: A remote attacker can conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
Summary: CA Service Desk contains multiple vulnerabilities that
can allow a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting
attacks. CA has issued patches to address the vulnerabilities. The
vulnerabilities, CVE-2008-4119, are due to insecure handling of
passed variables in multiple web forms. An attacker, who can
convince a user to click on a specially crafted link, can
potentially conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
Mitigating Factors: None
Severity: CA has given these vulnerabilities a Low risk rating.
Affected Products:
CA Service Desk r11.2
CA CMDB 11.0
CA CMDB 11.1
CA CMDB 11.2
Affected Platforms:
Microsoft Windows 2003 R2
Microsoft Windows 2003 SP1
Microsoft Windows 2003 SP2
Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Family with SP4 applied (32 bit only)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.0 x86
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.0 x86
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 (SLES) x86
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP1 (SLES) x86
Sun Solaris 9 SPARC (64 bit only)
Sun Solaris 10 SPARC (64 bit only)
HP/UX 11.11 PA-RISC (64 bit only)
HP/UX 11.23 PA-RISC (64 bit only)
HP/UX 11.31 PA-RISC (64 bit only)
AIX 5.2 (64 bit only)
AIX 5.3 (64 bit only)
Status and Recommendation:
CA CMDB 11.0 and CA CMDB 11.1 users should upgrade to CA CMDB
11.2, which includes all of the fixes.
CA has issued the following cumulative fixes for CA Service Desk
r11.2 to address the vulnerabilities.
Note: If you are using a version of CA Service Desk earlier than
r11.2, you will first need to upgrade to r11.2. For users of
earlier versions, CA recommends upgrading to r11.2.
