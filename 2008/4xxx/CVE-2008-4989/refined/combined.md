How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-678-2: GnuTLS regression

10 December 2008

GnuTLS regression

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [gnutls12](/security/cves?package=gnutls12) -
* [gnutls13](/security/cves?package=gnutls13) -
* [gnutls26](/security/cves?package=gnutls26) -

## Details

USN-678-1 fixed a vulnerability in GnuTLS. The upstream patch introduced a

regression when validating certain certificate chains that would report valid

certificates as untrusted. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Martin von Gagern discovered that GnuTLS did not properly verify certificate

chains when the last certificate in the chain was self-signed. If a remote

attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be

exploited to view sensitive information. ([CVE-2008-4989](/security/CVE-2008-4989))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1719-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Florian Weimer
February 10, 2009                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : gnutls13
Vulnerability  : design flaw
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-4989
Debian Bug     : 505360

Martin von Gagern discovered that GNUTLS, an implementation of the
TLS/SSL protocol, handles verification of X.509 certificate chains
incorrectly if a self-signed certificate is configured as a trusted
certificate.  This could cause clients to accept forged server
certificates as genuine.  (CVE-2008-4989)

In addition, this update tightens the checks for X.509v1 certificates
which causes GNUTLS to reject certain certificate chains it accepted
before.  (In certificate chain processing, GNUTLS does not recognize
X.509v1 certificates as valid unless explicitly requested by the
application.)

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-3+etch3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-3 of the gnutls26 package.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls13 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- squirrelmail
Insufficient input checks could allow remote attackers to conduct a
cross site scripting (XSS) attack (CVE-2008-2379).
Affected Prodcuts: 10.3
- gnutls
gnutls did not properly verify x509 certificate chains. An attacker
could exploit that to trick client programs into trusting servers
that would normally get rejected (CVE-2008-4989).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.3, 11.0
- rubygem-activerecord
Missing sanity checks of the :limit and :offset parameters in SQL
queries could potentially be exploited to conduct SQL injection
attacks (CVE-2008-4094).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- rubygem-actionpack
Missing input sanitation in rubygem-actionpack allowed remote
attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers via specially crafted
URLs (CVE-2008-5189).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- samba
Malicious clients could potentially retrieve arbitrary memory
content from a samba server (CVE-2008-4314).
Affected Products: SLES10, 11.0
- dbus-1
Local users could crash services connected to the D-bus
(CVE-2008-3834).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- pdns
Remote attackers could crash pdnsd if the daemon was configured with
distributor-threads=1. With the default configuration pdns is not
affected by this problem (CVE-2008-5277).
Affected Products: 10.3, 11.0
- php5
The php imap module used an old API of the imap client library. The
library aborts programs that use too large buffers. Specially
crafted emails could therefore crash php applications that use imap
(CVE-2008-2829).
Affected Products: 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- pam\_krb5
Insufficient file access permissions checks allowed users to read
Kerberos tickets of other users if pam\_krb5 was configured with the
option "existing\_ticket" (CVE-2008-3825).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- openswan/strongswan
By sending a specially crafted Dead Peer Detection (DPD) packet
remote attackers could crash the pluto IKE daemon (CVE-2009-0790).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- clamav
ClamAV was updated to version 0.95 to also fix some potential security
bugs. (CVE-2009-1241)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLED, OES, SLES9-11
- gstreamer-0\_10-plugins-base
Specially crafted cover art tags in vorbis files could trigger a
heap overflow in the base64 decoder. Attackers could potentially
exploit that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0586).
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0, SLE11
- gnome-panel
The dbus package used a too permissive configuration. Therefore intended
access control for some services was not applied (CVE-2008-4311).
The new configuration denies access by default. Some dbus services break
due to this setting and need an updated configuration as well.
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- postgresql
Remote authenticated users could crash the postgresql server by requesting
a conversion with an inappropriate encoding (CVE-2009-0922). This was a
minor version upgrade.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLED, OES, SLES9-11
- acroread\_ja
Multiple flaws in the JBIG2 decoder and the JavaScript engine of the
Adobe Reader allowed attackers to crash acroread or even execute
arbitrary code by tricking users into opening specially crafted PDF
files. (CVE-2009-0658, CVE-2009-0927, CVE-2009-0193, CVE-2009-0928,
CVE-2009-1061, CVE-2009-1062)
Affected products: SLED10-11
- ghostscript
With this update the ghostscript-library four vulnerabilities were fixed:
- heap-overflow in JBIG2 decoder (CVE-2009-0196)
- integer overflow in ICC library (CVE-2009-0792)
- crash in CCITTFax decoder
- buffer overflow in BaseFont writer module
Affected products: SLE11 (packages for other products will be
released soon)
- xine-devel/libxine-devel
Specially crafted 4x movie files could cause an integer overflow in
xine-lib (CVE-2009-0698).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE10-11
- moodle
Special command sequences in TeX files allowed users to read arbitrary
files (CVE-2009-1171).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- gnutls
The previous security fix for gnutls (CVE-2008-4989) introduced a re-
gression in the X.509 validation code for self-signed certificates.
This update fixes this problem.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE10 (will be released soon),
SLE11
- udev update on SLES 10 requires udevd restart
The previously released udev update requires a restart of the udev
daemon on SLES 10. Either use
/etc/init.d/boot.udev restart
or reboot the machine.
On other SUSE products udevd is restarted by just applying the update
already.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

* **About Security Advisories**

  Although, the core GnuTLS team does not have resources to
  analyse the background and impact of security issues in depth,
  we do take security seriously. All known information on security incidents
  is collected and published in this page.

  Our idea is to turn writing security advisory into an open
  process where everyone can contribute. Everyone is invited to
  analyse the impact of discovered bugs, and, of course, also to
  study the code for new bugs.

  All serious analysis of bugs will be posted on this page.

  If this level of support is inadequate for your needs,
  [customized commercial support](commercial.html) is
  available.* **Reporting security problems**

    Send non-public reports to [the maintainers](contrib.html). All
    other reports should be sent to [one of the
    mailing lists](lists.html).* **Advisories**

      | Tag | Severity | Information |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | GNUTLS-SA-2012-4 ["CRIME" attack](http://security.blogoverflow.com/2012/09/how-can-you-protect-yourself-from-crime-beasts-successor/) [CVE-2012-4929](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4929) | Possible plaintext recovery | There is an attack on TLS called "CRIME" which takes advantage of compression and may recover plaintext under certain circumstances.  **Who is affected by this attack?** + Clients or servers that use compression and provide the ability to   an adversary to inject data (multiple times) in their session.  **How to mitigate the attack?** + Do not enable compression (GnuTLS doesn't enable it by default) + When using compression use the CBC ciphers that include a random   padding up to 255 bytes. That would increase the number of trials an   attacker needs to perform significantly. Note that using compression provides [information to an attacker](https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/ecrypt/provpriv2012/abstracts/barghavan.pdf) on the plaintext.  [Security advisory](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/6304)  [A description of the attack](http://security.blogoverflow.com/2012/09/how-can-you-protect-yourself-from-crime-beasts-successor/)  [Another analysis of the attack](http://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2012/09/tls-crime-beast-and-you-programmer.html) |
      | GNUTLS-SA-2012-3 [CVE-2012-1569](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1569) | Denial of service | This vulnerability is in the libtasn1 library and affects the DER length decoding which is fixed in [2.12 release](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-libtasn1/2012-03/msg00000.html). [Write-up by Mu Dynamics](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/5959) **Recommendation:** Upgrade to libtasn1 2.12. |
      | GNUTLS-SA-2012-2 [CVE-2012-1573](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1573) | Possible buffer overflow/Denial of service | TLS record handling vulnerability fixed in [GnuTLS 3.0.15](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/5912). [Write-up by Mu Dynamics](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/5959) **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.0.17 or 2.12.18. |
      | GNUTLS-SA-2012-1 [CVE-2012-0390](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0390) | Timing attack (DTLS) | [Announcement of GnuTLS 3.0.11](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/5657) [The paper describing the attack](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/dtls.pdf) This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform partial plaintext recovery using a timing attack in CBC-mode encryption. The attack is applicable to Datagram TLS (DTLS).  **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.0.11. |
      | GNUTLS-SA-2011-2 [CVE-2011-4128](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-4128) | Possible buffer overflow/Denial of service | [Mailing list discussion](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/5596)  Note that this vulnerability is triggered by TLS clients that utilize the session resumption functions in a particular way. Clients that perform session resumption using the same steps as in [the example code of GnuTLS documentation](http://www.gnu.org/s/gnutls/manual/html_node/Client-with-Resume-capability-example.html#Client-with-Resume-capability-example) are not vulnerable. A preliminary analysis found no vulnerable clients. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.0.7 or 2.12.14. |
      | GNUTLS-SA-2011-1 [Rizzo attack on TLS](http://www.ekoparty.org/2011/juliano-rizzo.php) | Plaintext recovery | [Mailing list discussion](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2011-09/msg00064.html)  **Recommendation:** Make use of TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2 protocols that are not vulnerable to the attack. TLS 1.1 is enabled by default in GnuTLS since version 2.0.0 (released in 2007). If this is not possible, disable CBC ciphers. |
      | ~~GNUTLS-SA-2010-1~~ [CVE-2010-0731](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0731) | Remote Denial of Service | [RedHat bugzilla report](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=573028) [Mailing list discussion](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/4230) This vulnerability is on a deprecated since 2006 version of GnuTLS. We keep the information here because this version was included in some distributions. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to the latest stable branch. |
      | GNUTLS-SA-2009-5 [CERT VU#120541](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/120541) [CVE-2009-3555](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3555) | Plaintext injection attack | [Mailing list discussion](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/1838) **Recommendation:** Disable support for TLS renegotiation in application servers, or better upgrade to GnuTLS 2.10.x. |
      | GNUTLS-SA-2009-4 [CVE-2009-2730](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2730) | False positive in certificate hostname validation | [Announcement of v2.8.3 that solves the problem.](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/1743) [Analysis of the vulnerability and minimal patch.](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnutls/2009-08/msg00011.html) [How to check if your GnuTLS library is vulnerable.](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2009-08/msg00062.html) Back-ported patches for earlier releases: [[1]](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/1994) [[2]](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3790) **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 2.8.3 or later. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# GnuTLS: Certificate validation error — GLSA **200901-10**

A certificate validation error in GnuTLS might allow for spoofing attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-libs/gnutls** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.1-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.4.1-r2** |

### Background

GnuTLS is an open-source implementation of TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0.

### Description

Martin von Gagern reported that the \_gnutls\_x509\_verify\_certificate()
function in lib/x509/verify.c trusts certificate chains in which the
last certificate is an arbitrary trusted, self-signed certificate.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability and spoof arbitrary
names to conduct Man-In-The-Middle attacks and intercept sensitive
information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GnuTLS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/gnutls-2.4.1-r2"
```
