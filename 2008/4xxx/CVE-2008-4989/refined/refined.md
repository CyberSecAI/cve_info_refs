{
  "CVE-2008-4989": {
    "Description": "GnuTLS incorrectly handles verification of X.509 certificate chains if a self-signed certificate is configured as a trusted certificate. This could cause clients to accept forged server certificates as genuine.",
    "Root cause": "The `_gnutls_x509_verify_certificate()` function in lib/x509/verify.c trusts certificate chains in which the last certificate is an arbitrary trusted, self-signed certificate.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper certificate chain validation",
      "Acceptance of self-signed certificates as root of trust."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can spoof arbitrary names, conduct man-in-the-middle attacks, and intercept sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote network attacks.",
       "Man-in-the-middle attack."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack."
  }
