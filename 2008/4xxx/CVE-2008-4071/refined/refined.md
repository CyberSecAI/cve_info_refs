Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4071:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is triggered by providing an invalid URI to the Adobe Acrobat ActiveX control. Specifically, the `acroie:///DoS` URI causes the application to crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The Adobe Acrobat ActiveX control improperly handles malformed or unexpected URIs.
- This leads to a denial-of-service condition

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the Adobe Acrobat application, specifically when used within Internet Explorer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed via a web page containing a malicious script that leverages the Adobe Acrobat ActiveX control.
- The specific URI "acroie:///DoS" is used in the script as the malicious input to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and host a web page with the malicious code or inject the malicious code on a website.
- The victim must browse to this page with Internet Explorer, where the Adobe Acrobat ActiveX control is used.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the victim's machine to trigger the DoS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit was tested on Windows Vista with Internet Explorer 7 and Adobe Acrobat 9.
- The exploit was not reproducible on Windows XP according to the author.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by any URI that Adobe Acrobat doesn't like as well, although the provided URI is explicitly mentioned.
- When a URI starting with `file:///` is used, it can be observed in the bottom left area, and can be used to diagnose the behavior.
