```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a combination of creating a window class with a specific name, setting the memory protection of the class name to PAGE_NOACCESS, and then registering the window class. This action triggers an access violation when the system attempts to write to this protected memory.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Memory protection bypass",
    "Access violation due to write attempt on protected memory",
    "Improper exception handling"
  ],
  "Impact": "Exploitation leads to a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD), resulting in a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation through a usermode application with limited privileges.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to execute the exploit code locally. No special permissions are required beyond a standard user account."
