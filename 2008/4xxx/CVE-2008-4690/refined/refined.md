Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4690:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the lynx web browser handles the `lynxcgi://` URL handler when in advanced mode. The fix for CVE-2005-2929 only disabled the lynxcgi handler when not in advanced mode. In advanced mode, it displays the URL that is selected. However, if lynx is called from the command line and is set as the URL handler, this poses a security risk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `lynxcgi://` protocol handler can be abused when lynx is used as the default URL handler, allowing the execution of arbitrary commands.
- The vulnerability exists specifically when lynx is in advanced mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker could craft a malicious URL using the `lynxcgi://` handler. If lynx is configured as the default URL handler (e.g., through a mime type or .mailcap file) and is invoked, arbitrary commands could be executed when the crafted URL is opened by the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious URL that uses the `lynxcgi://` handler to the user, usually through a link.
- The user's system must have lynx configured as the default URL handler for the `lynxcgi://` scheme.
- The user must be using lynx in advanced mode.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content indicates the vulnerability is not present when lynx is not used in advanced mode or when lynx is not used as a url handler.
- The openwall.com content suggests that this is not easily exploitable, requiring user to define this specific protocol handler which is deemed unlikely.
- The easiest mitigation as suggested is to disable CGI support in `/etc/lynx.cfg`, which is also considered a wise default.
- The provided opensuse.org content confirms that this CVE is related to lynx and arbitrary command execution.
- The vulnerability was found and reported by Clint Ruoho.
