```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `to-upgrade` plugin in Feta creates temporary files insecurely in the `/tmp` directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure temporary file creation leading to symlink attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local denial of service. An attacker can create a symlink with the same name as the temporary file, potentially leading to destruction or rewriting of system or user files, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Local. An attacker can create a symlink in the `/tmp` directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system to create a symlink in `/tmp`.
