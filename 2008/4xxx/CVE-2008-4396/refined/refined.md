Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists within FileAlyzer 1.6.0.0 (beta 1.6.0.4) due to improper parsing of a malformed executable file during analysis.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability. This occurs when the application tries to write more data to a buffer allocated on the stack than the buffer can hold. This overwrites adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can cause a crash (as evidenced by the provided screenshot), and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by overwriting the return address on the stack.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted, malformed executable file to FileAlyzer for analysis.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to get the user to open the crafted file using FileAlyzer.
