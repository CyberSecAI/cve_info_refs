    *   Attack Vector: Through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
    *   Required Capabilities: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious SQL code into the vulnerable parameters of the affected extensions.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Affected Extension: Page Improvements (sm_pageimprovements)
    *   Root cause: The extension was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
    *   Impact: Attackers could inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, allowing them to steal cookies, hijack sessions, or deface websites.
    *   Attack Vector: Through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized before being displayed on the web page.
    *   Required Capabilities: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameters of the affected extension.
