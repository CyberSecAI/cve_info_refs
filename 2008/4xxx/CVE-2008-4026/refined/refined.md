      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-4026",
      "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Word handles specially crafted Word files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Word file with a malformed value. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a memory corruption issue that occurs when parsing specially crafted Word files with a malformed value. This memory corruption can allow arbitrary code execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption due to malformed data handling"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain control of the affected system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Email: Attacker sends a specially crafted Word document to a victim, convincing them to open it.",
        "Web-based: Attacker hosts a malicious Word file on a website, tricking users into downloading and opening it."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious Word file with a malformed value that triggers the memory corruption vulnerability. They must also convince the user to open the file.",
      "mitigations": [
        "Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources.",
        "Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) to open files from unknown sources.",
        "Users who have installed and are using the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool for Office 2000 will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and later editions of Office."
