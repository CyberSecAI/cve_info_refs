# USN-875-1: Red Hat Cluster Suite vulnerabilities

18 December 2009

Red Hat Cluster Suite vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [redhat-cluster](/security/cves?package=redhat-cluster) -
* [redhat-cluster-suite](/security/cves?package=redhat-cluster-suite) -

## Details

Multiple insecure temporary file handling vulnerabilities were discovered

in Red Hat Cluster. A local attacker could exploit these to overwrite

arbitrary local files via symlinks. ([CVE-2008-4192](/security/CVE-2008-4192), [CVE-2008-4579](/security/CVE-2008-4579),

[CVE-2008-4580](/security/CVE-2008-4580), [CVE-2008-6552](/security/CVE-2008-6552))

It was discovered that CMAN did not properly handle malformed configuration

files. An attacker could cause a denial of service (via CPU consumption and

memory corruption) in a node if the attacker were able to modify the

cluster configuration for the node. ([CVE-2008-6560](/security/CVE-2008-6560))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.10

Thanks!

Same as the other fence_* issues.  Those tools are fencing agents used
by Red Hat Cluster Suite (tools that can be used by a cluster to make
sure that non-responding cluster member is really down, so shared
resources can be taken by some other cluster member;  they usually do
so by communicating with some remote device capable of cutting the
system from power, or reboot it (power switches, kvm switches, remote
consoles, ...)).

In the Cluster Suite for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, they were packaged
in the fence package.  Cluster Suite for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 has
them in cman package (Cluster Manager).

Other vendors shipping Cluster Suite are likely to have them packaged
in packages named as fence and cman, or similar, based on the version
they use.

Please mention both fence_apc and fence_apc_snmp in the CVE
description, as both agents do the same kind of logging.  Description
may also mention cman package, as those fencing agents may be bundled
in fence or cman package, based on the version used.

Note: CVE-2008-4192 was recently assigned to fence_egenera having
similar flaw.

Additionally, fence_manual / fence_ack_manual communicate via FIFO
socket created in /tmp.  fence_manual creates
fifo /tmp/fence_manual.fifo and waits for fence_ack_manual to write to
it.  This can possibly result in the overwrite of arbitrary file.

| [Description](#c0)  Stefan Behte (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2008-10-08 19:46:26 UTC  ``` /usr/sbin/fence_apc logs to /tmp/apclog, if you use verbose mode: ./fence_apc -v -l foo -p bar -n 1 -a 192.168.0.1 it will write into that file.  if you a) link to /etc/passwd b) redirect the connection (e.g. arp-spoof, dns-spoof) you can do this on the host you redirected to: echo "hacked::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" | nc -l -p 23 And the account will be appened in /etc/passwd. Honestly I doubt that will ever happen in reality, but it's possible.  <http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/cluster.git?p=cluster.git;a=blob_plain;f=fence/agents/apc/fence_apc.py;hb=HEAD> seems to be a completely updated version. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Stefan Behte (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2008-10-19 03:42:12 UTC  ``` <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/10/13/3> Seems there is also a hole in fence_manual / fence_ack_manual fifo handling, it's a different bug, but I guess we can fix both in this bug #. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Stefan Behte (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2008-10-19 03:43:54 UTC  ``` CVE-2008-4579 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-4579>):   The (1) fence_apc and (2) fence_apc_snmp programs, as used in (a)   fence 2.02.00-r1 and possibly (b) cman, when running in verbose mode,   allows local users to append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack   on the apclog temporary file.  CVE-2008-4580 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-4580>):   fence_manual in fence allows local users to modify arbitrary files   via a symlink attack on the fence_manual.fifo temporary file.   ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Stefan Behte (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2008-11-10 16:10:17 UTC  ``` ha-cluster: *ping* ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Alex Legler (RETIRED)   archtester gentoo-dev Security  2009-03-09 19:29:23 UTC  ``` ha-cluster: Looks like you did some bumping. Can you please ascertain/confirm whether this issue is fixed in your newer ebuilds? ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Alex Legler (RETIRED)   archtester gentoo-dev Security  2009-06-09 15:32:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=240576#c4)) > ha-cluster: Looks like you did some bumping. Can you please ascertain/confirm > whether this issue is fixed in your newer ebuilds? >   Thanks!  I found this at the Debian bugtracker:     * New upstream release version 2.03.09.      - Upstream code audit fixes several tmpfile race conditions, among        them CVE-2008-4579 and CVE-2008-4580. (Closes: #496410)  We have that version in the tree, stabled, old versions are removed.  So, GLSA voting time! ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Stefan Behte (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2009-06-12 22:01:28 UTC  ``` Ready to vote, I vote YES. What about you, a3li? ;) ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-07-10 11:03:03 UTC  ``` YES, filed ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Jaak Ristioja    2010-07-23 08:54:36 UTC  ``` There is no sys-cluster/fence in portage any more. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Stefan Behte (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2010-09-29 20:52:33 UTC  ``` GLSA 201009-09, thanks everyone. ``` |  |
