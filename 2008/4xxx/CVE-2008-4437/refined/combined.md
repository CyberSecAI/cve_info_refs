How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# 3.0.4, 3.1.4, and 2.22.4 Security Advisory

Tuesday, Aug 12th, 2008
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issue has been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Local files on the server can be attached to a bug (making them
  publicly visible) when importing bugs with --attach_path

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Directory Traversal
Affected:    2.22.1 - 2.22.4, 2.23.3 and higher
Description: When importing bugs using importxml.pl, the --attach_path
             option can be specified, pointing to the directory where
             attachments to import are stored. If the XML file being
             read by importxml.pl contains a malicious
             <data encoding="filename">../relative_path/to/local_file</data>
             node, the script follows this relative path and attaches the
             local file pointed by it to the bug, making the file public.
             The security fix makes sure the relative path is always
             ignored.
             Most Bugzilla installations will not be vulnerable, as
             they do not use --attach_path with importxml.pl.
             (In fact, most installations don't use importxml.pl at all.)

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fix for this issue is included in the
releases. Upgrading to a release with the relevant fix will
protect your installation from possible exploits of this issue.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14
Build Identifier: 3.0.4
when importing a bug in xml, there is an insecure call done to open() which could potentially allow command execution. the bug in the code is as follows:
sub process\_attachment() {
my ( $twig, $attach ) = @\_;
...
my $encoding = $attach->first\_child('data')->{'att'}->{'encoding'};
...
elsif ($encoding =~ /filename/) {
...
my $attach\_filename = $attach\_path . "/" . $attach->field('data'); <-- field('data') comes from the xml file
open(ATTACH\_FH, $attach\_filename) or <-- here's the insecure open
Error("cannot open $attach\_filename", undef);
...
}
basicly, you could have something like "; <shell commands> |".
a nice solutions would be to use the 3-arg open.
another issue is that there is no check done for directory traversal.

why isn't any of this being caught by taint checks? Does the xml parser thing detaint stuff as a side effect, or something?

This is slightly mitigated by the fact that Bugzilla itself would never generate such a path, and the paths we \*do\* generate are fairly easy to check for (which should make this easier to fix).
However, yes, it's still definitely a security issue for any installation that has generally-available bug importing (which isn't any installation that I know of, but we offer the feature so I'm sure that some installations use it).

> why isn't any of this being caught by taint checks?
It's tainted:
Insecure dependency in piped open while running with -T switch at ./importxml.pl line 381, <> chunk 1.
I get this if I have (in the XML file):
<data encoding="filename">../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/X11/xorg.conf;kwrite |</data>
But if I have the following, xorg.conf is attached instead of the expected file:
<data encoding="filename">../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/X11/xorg.conf</data>
I could use it to attach /etc/passwd, and then everybody could happily view this file as an attachment in the bug.
Now if I add trick\_taint($attach\_filename); before calling open() in importxml.pl with the first data above, I get (instead of the "Insecure dependency" error):
./importxml.pl -v --attach\_path data/ /root/patches/evil\_bug2.xml
sh: data//../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/X11/xorg.conf: Permission denied
sh: kwrite: No such file or directory
So it seems the tainting protection is working correctly and you cannot execute commands locally. But you can still attach "secret" files, which is annoying.

I don't see how it matters. There should never be any relative path anywhere in the string, and this should catch anything before the filename yes?
I am no REGEXP guru though so I am open to suggestions.

The regexp is fine as is IMO. This way, it will catch filename.ext/../../../../../etc/passwd.Status: NEW → ASSIGNED

I think we should write /gs instead of /g to catch newlines correctly. open() is supposed to throw an error like this:
Unsuccessful open on filename containing newline at ./importxml.pl line 385, <> chunk 1.
But we can do this effort. So r=LpSolit with /gs.

that looks good to me, although, technically, there might still be a small infoleak this way. since .. is still ok, you could end up opening the previous directory. on some unices you can still do that and get to see the dirstructure.

basicly on some unices you can just read() a directory.
on NetBSD 3.1 for example you can do cat ..; in a dir, and it will print out the dir structure of that directory.

No, this won't work as the input string is tainted. You cannot run commands.

I know that. this was just an example.
suppose you'd put in nothing but .. as the filename. then it would read the directory data and assume that is the file used.
