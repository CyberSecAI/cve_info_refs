Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4261:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Internet Explorer handles the embedding of objects into a web page. Specifically, it occurs when the browser encounters unexpected or extra data during this embedding process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:**  The core issue is memory corruption. When Internet Explorer encounters unexpected data while embedding an object, it can corrupt memory in a way that can be exploited.
- **Improper Handling of Extra Data:** The vulnerability arises due to the browser's failure to properly handle extra or unexpected data during the embedding of objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could potentially take complete control of the system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attack:** Attackers can host malicious websites containing specially crafted web pages designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed through Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers could also inject the malicious content into compromised websites, or websites accepting user-provided content.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious web page, typically by tricking them into clicking a link in an email or instant message.
- **Malicious Advertisements:** Displaying specially crafted web content through banner ads is also a potential attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker does not need any physical access to the victim's machine.
- **Web Server:**  The attacker requires a web server to host the malicious webpage.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs the ability to trick the user into visiting the malicious site.
- **Technical knowledge:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted web page to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- Internet Explorer 6 is vulnerable on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, but not Windows 2000.
- Internet Explorer 7 is not affected by this specific vulnerability.
- Windows XP SP2 has "Local Machine Zone Lockdown", which mitigates the vulnerability if the local machine zone is the target of the attack.
- Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and 2008 runs with "Enhanced Security Configuration" which reduces the chance of exploitation for websites not in the Trusted Sites zone.
