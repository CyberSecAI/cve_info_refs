The attacker would need to convince the user to visit the malicious site, typically through links in email or instant messages or via malicious banner advertisements.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host or inject a malicious web page and convince a user to visit it, which doesn't require any special network position."
