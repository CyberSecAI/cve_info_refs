Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `_httpsrequest` function within the embedded Snoopy library used by Moodle and WordPress. This function does not properly sanitize user-supplied URLs, specifically HTTPS URLs, before processing them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is command injection due to the lack of sanitization. Shell metacharacters in the URL aren't properly handled, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The `_httpsrequest` function doesn't validate or sanitize the input URL, making it susceptible to exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, this could lead to privilege escalation if the web server process has higher permissions than the typical user.
- **System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain full control of the server, leading to data breaches, service disruption, and further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP(S) Requests:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious HTTP or HTTPS requests with shell metacharacters embedded in the URL. This can be done remotely, via the web interface.
- **Exploitation through vulnerable component:**  The vulnerability is present in an embedded copy of the Snoopy library which means that the application using it will inherit the vulnerability if not patched.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP(S) requests to the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability doesn't require any specific level of authentication making it easily exploitable.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to identify the location where the vulnerable `_httpsrequest` function is used and craft a request that targets it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in an embedded copy of Snoopy, so many applications are affected by this including, Moodle, WordPress, Ampache, Mahara, Mediamate, Opendb and Pixelpost.
- Several sources reference a patch in Snoopy version 1.2.4 which should mitigate the vulnerability.

The information extracted provides more details than the basic CVE description by highlighting affected components, the specifics of the vulnerability, and the widespread nature of the issue due to the use of embedded Snoopy library.
