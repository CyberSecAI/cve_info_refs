{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling the `apa_album_ID` parameter in the `album.php` file, leading to SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries to access, modify, or delete data in the database, and inject malicious scripts into the web application to perform actions on behalf of other users or steal sensitive data.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The `apa_album_ID` parameter within the `album.php` file via HTTP GET request."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
