## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**What is the Microsoft Office Word Viewer?**

Microsoft Office Word Viewer is a replacement for Word Viewer 2003 and all previous Word Viewer versions. For information on how to obtain the latest Word Viewer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 891090](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/891090).

**I am using the original release version of Microsoft Office Word Viewer 2003; does this security update apply to me?**

The original release version of Microsoft Office Word Viewer 2003 contains the vulnerable code, but in order to install this security update, you must first install Microsoft Office Word Viewer 2003 Service Pack 3. For more information about how to obtain this service pack, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934736](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/934736).

**Where are the file information details?**

The file information details can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 957173](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/957173).

**MS08-074 also describes vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac. How does MS08-074 relate to this bulletin (MS08-072)?**

This security update for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (960402), Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (960401), and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac (960403) also addresses the vulnerabilities described in MS08-074. Users with Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, or Open XML File Format Converter for Mac installed will have to install this security update but will only need to install it once.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**Why is this update rated Critical for Outlook 2007?**

Outlook 2007 default configuration uses Microsoft Office Word 2007 as the default e-mail editor. When using Microsoft Office Word as the default e-mail editor on Microsoft Office Outlook 2007, this vulnerability can be exploited using the preview pane requiring no user interaction. As a result Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 has been rated critical.

**Why is this update Critical for Word 2000 but only Important for all other affected versions of Word?**

Microsoft Office Word 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.

**This is a Microsoft Office Word update. Why are Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 and Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 referenced in the Affected Software table?**

The files that are updated to address the vulnerabilities documented in this bulletin are core files to Microsoft Office Word. For Microsoft Office Word 2007 and Microsoft Office Word 2007 Service Pack 1, some of these core files are shared with Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 and Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1, and provide functionality, such as editing, to Outlook. Therefore, Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 need to be updated as well, and Word 2007 and Word 2007 Service Pack 1 and Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 are serviced by the same package.

Users with only Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 installed will still need to apply this Word update to their systems. Users with Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 that also have Word 2007 or Word 2007 Service Pack 1 installed will also need to apply this update but they will only need to install it once. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 949370](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/949370).

**I am using Works 8.0, how do I update to Works 8.5?**

Microsoft has provided a free update for Works 8.0 users to Works 8.5. As a result, all customers using Microsoft Works 8.0, Works Suite 2005, or Works Suite 2004 should update to the security-enhanced Works 8.5. Please see [Microsoft Works Update](https://www.microsoft.com/products/works/international/update_1001.mspx) for more information.

**How do I know if I need to update my version of Works?**

Find out whether you need an update by determining which Works version you have. Simply start the Works Task Launcher and click on the Help button. If the last option in the Help menu reads, "About Microsoft Works Suite 2004," then you are eligible to update. If the last option reads, "About Microsoft Works," then select that option. In the "About Microsoft Works" dialog, look for the version number. If the version is 8.0, then you are eligible to update. If it displays Works 8.5, then you already have the most current version of the software.

**What components of the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats are updated by this bulletin?**

The update included with this security bulletin applies only to the specific component within the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats that is affected. For example, in an Excel bulletin, only the Excel compatibility pack component files are included in the update packages and not Word or PowerPoint compatibility pack component files. Word compatibility pack component files are updated in a Word bulletin and PowerPoint compatibility pack component files are updated in a PowerPoint bulletin.

**The Office component discussed in this article is part of the Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the version of the Office Suite installed on your system shipped with the component discussed in this bulletin, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that shipped with the particular Office Suite and offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is included in the version of the Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. However, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335).

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**I use Microsoft Office 2007 RTM. Are any additional security features included in this update?**

Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2007, when a users of Microsoft Office 2007 RTM install this update, their systems will be upgraded to functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 1. All updates released after December 8, 2007 for Microsoft Office 2007 will include these security features, which were introduced in [Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=9ec51594-992c-4165-a997-25da01f388f5&displaylang;=en). We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems.

## Word Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4024

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Word handles specially crafted Word files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Word file with a malformed record. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-4024](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4024).

#### Mitigating Factors for Word Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4024

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, a Web site could contain a Word file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site and open a specially crafted Word file, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, and then convincing them to open the specially crafted Word file.
* Users who have installed and are using the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool for Office 2000 will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and Office 2003.

#### Workarounds for Word Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4024

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ for Word Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4024

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When a user opens a specially crafted Office file, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Word file with an affected version of Microsoft Office Word.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Word file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, a Web site could contain a Word file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site and open a specially crafted Word file, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Office Word is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Word opens files. However, after applying this update, attempts to open a specially crafted Microsoft Word document may still cause Word to exit or return an error unexpectedly. This behavior is not exploitable.

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Word RTF Object Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4025

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office handles specially crafted Rich Text Format (RTF) files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted RTF file in Word or reads a specially crafted e-mail sent in the RTF format. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of an affected system in the context of the currently logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-4025](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4025).

#### Mitigating Factors for Word RTF Object Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4025

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites.

#### FAQ for Word RTF Object Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4025

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system in the context of the currently logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by a memory calculation error when processing a malformed control word in a specially crafted RTF file. The error may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of an affected system in the context of the currently logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted RTF file with an affected version of Microsoft Office Word or read a specially crafted e-mail in Microsoft Office Outlook with Word as the default e-mail editor.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted RTF e-mail to a system that uses Word as its default editor. The vulnerability could be exploited when a user reads or previews the e-mail.

**Note** By default, Outlook 2003 does not use Word as its default editor. However, Outlook 2007 does.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a RTF file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convincing them to open the specially crafted RTF file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Office Word or Microsoft Office Outlook is used are primarily at risk, including workstations and terminal servers. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way Word calculates the required memory allocation when opening RTF files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Workarounds for Word Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4026

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
* On Word client systems, use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or un-trusted sources

  The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) will protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

  To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office system installed.

  To install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:
  [Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&displaylang=en)

  MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:
  [https:](https://)

  To enable MOICE, change the registered handler for the .xls, .xlt, and .xla file formats. The following table describes the command to enable or to disable MOICE for the .xls, .xlt, and .xla file formats:

| Command to use to enable MOICE to be the registered handler | Command to use to disable MOICE as the registered handler |
| --- | --- |
| ASSOC .doc=oice.word.document | ASSOC .doc=Word.Document.8 |

**Note** On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the commands will need to be run from an elevated command prompt.

For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

**Impact of Workaround.** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted RTF file with an affected version of Microsoft Office Word or read a specially crafted e-mail in Microsoft Office Outlook with Word as the default e-mail editor.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted RTF e-mail to a system that uses Word as its default editor. The vulnerability could be exploited when a user reads or previews the e-mail.

**Note** By default, Outlook 2003 does not use Word as its default editor. However, Outlook 2007 does.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a RTF file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convincing them to open the specially crafted RTF file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Office Word or Microsoft Office Outlook is used are primarily at risk, such as workstations and terminal servers. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way Word cleans up memory after encountering malformed RTF content.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site, and then convincing them to open the specially crafted RTF file.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and Office 2003.

#### FAQ for Word RTF Object Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4031

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of an affected system in the context of the currently logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by a memory calculation error when processing a malformed string in a specially crafted RTF file. The error may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of an affected system in the context of the currently logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted RTF file with an affected version of Microsoft Office Word or read a specially crafted e-mail in Microsoft Office Outlook with Word as the default e-mail editor.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted RTF e-mail to a system that uses Word as its default editor. The vulnerability could be exploited when a user reads or previews the e-mail.

**Note** By default, Outlook 2003 does not use Word as its default editor. However, Outlook 2007 does.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a RTF file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convincing them to open the specially crafted RTF file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where the affected software is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way Word calculates the required memory allocation when opening RTF files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Workarounds for Word Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4837

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
* On Word client systems, use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or un-trusted sources

  The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) will protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

  To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office system installed.

  To install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:
  [Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&displaylang=en)

  MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:
  </https:>[https:](https://)

  To enable MOICE, change the registered handler for the .xls, .xlt, and .xla file formats. The following table describes the command to enable or to disable MOICE for the .xls, .xlt, and .xla file formats:

| Command to use to enable MOICE to be the registered handler | Command to use to disable MOICE as the registered handler |
| --- | --- |
| ASSOC .doc=oice.word.document | ASSOC .doc=Word.Document.8 |

**Note** On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the commands will need to be run from an elevated command prompt.

For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

**Impact of Workaround.** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

  **Note** Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Office Features

The following table contains the list of feature names (case sensitive) that must be reinstalled for the update.

To install all features, you can use **REINSTALL=ALL** or you can install the following features:

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your computer. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.

This security update requires that [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en) be installed on the system.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?** or **/help** | Displays usage dialog. |
| **/passive** | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel. |
| **/quiet** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/norestart** | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart. |
| **/forcerestart** | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |
| **/extract** | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/extract:<path>** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |
| **/lang:<LCID>** | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language. |
| **/log:<log file>** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

# Advisory Details

December 9th, 2008
## Microsoft Office RTF Drawing Object Heap Overflow Vulnerability

### ZDI-08-085ZDI-CAN-351

| CVE ID | [CVE-2008-4028](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4028) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Outlook](http://www.microsoft.com/outlook/) [Office Word](http://www.microsoft.com/word/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['6611']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of various Microsoft products including Word and Outlook. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page, open a malicious e-mail, or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of RTF documents containing multiple drawing object tags. First, code within wwlib.dll allocates a buffer for the tag object. Later, a result from a call into mso.dll is copied into the same buffer but with a larger size than was allocated by the callee. Successful exploitation can lead to remote compromise of a system under the credentials of the currently logged in user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS08-072.mspx> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2008-06-25 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2008-12-09 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

# Advisory Details

December 9th, 2008
## Microsoft Office RTF Drawing Object Heap Overflow Vulnerability

### ZDI-08-085ZDI-CAN-351

| CVE ID | [CVE-2008-4028](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4028) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Outlook](http://www.microsoft.com/outlook/) [Office Word](http://www.microsoft.com/word/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['6611']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of various Microsoft products including Word and Outlook. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page, open a malicious e-mail, or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of RTF documents containing multiple drawing object tags. First, code within wwlib.dll allocates a buffer for the tag object. Later, a result from a call into mso.dll is copied into the same buffer but with a larger size than was allocated by the callee. Successful exploitation can lead to remote compromise of a system under the credentials of the currently logged in user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS08-072.mspx> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2008-06-25 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2008-12-09 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
