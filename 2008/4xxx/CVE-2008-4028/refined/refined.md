{
  "cveId": "CVE-2008-4028",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Office handles specially crafted Rich Text Format (RTF) files when parsing multiple drawing object tags.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap overflow",
      "Improper memory allocation",
       "Inadequate size check during data copy operations",
      "Improper parsing of RTF objects"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take complete control of an affected system under the credentials of the currently logged-on user. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted RTF file in Word.",
      "Reading or previewing a specially crafted RTF e-mail in Outlook (when Word is the default editor).",
      "Visiting a malicious web page hosting a specially crafted RTF file."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted RTF file with multiple drawing object tags, and convince the user to open it using vulnerable software (Word or Outlook).",
    "attackerPositioning": "The attacker can be located remotely. Exploitation can occur via email, malicious websites or by convincing a user to open a malicious file."
  },
   "additionalNotes": [
        "The vulnerability occurs because code within `wwlib.dll` allocates a buffer for the drawing object tag, but later, a result from a call into `mso.dll` is copied into this buffer using a larger size than was originally allocated.",
        "User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
        "Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['6611']"
    ]
