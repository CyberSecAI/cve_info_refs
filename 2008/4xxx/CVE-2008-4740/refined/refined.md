{
  "CVE-2008-4740": {
    "description": "The templater.php script in TinyCMS 1.1.2 allows remote attackers to include arbitrary local files via a crafted config[template] parameter, as demonstrated by reading /etc/passwd.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a result of insecure handling of user-supplied input in the 'config[template]' parameter of the 'templater.php' script. The application uses the parameter to construct a file path without proper sanitization, which allows for local file inclusion.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
          "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary local files on the server. This may include sensitive system files (e.g., /etc/passwd) or configuration files, potentially exposing credentials and other confidential information.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through a web request to the vulnerable 'templater.php' script, using a crafted 'config[template]' parameter.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send web requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
