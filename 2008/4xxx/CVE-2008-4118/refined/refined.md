- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Sound Master 2nd software does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts on the user's web browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the internet. The user must be convinced to take an action like clicking a link or viewing a file containing the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into a component of the application that renders content to the user's browser.
