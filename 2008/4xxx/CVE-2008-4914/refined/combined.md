##### 1. Summary

Updated ESX patches address an issue loading corrupt virtual disks and update Service Console packages for net-snmp and libxml2.

#####

##### 2. Relevant Releases

VMware ESXi 3.5 without patch ESXe350-200901401-I-SG

VMware ESX 3.5 without patches  ESX350-200901401-SG,
ESX350-200901409-SG,

NOTE: Extended support for ESX 3.5 Update 1 ends on 7/25/2009, users should plan to upgrade to at least ESX 3.5 Update 2 by that time.

Extended support for ESX 3.0.2 Update 1 ends on 2009-08-08. Users should plan to upgrade to ESX 3.0.3 and preferably to the newest release available.

Extended support for ESX 2.5.5 ends on 2010-06-15. Users should plan to upgrade to ESX 3.0.3 and preferably to the newest release available.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. Loading a corrupt delta disk may cause ESX to crash
If the VMDK delta disk of a snapshot is corrupt, an ESX host might crash when the corrupted disk is loaded. VMDK delta files exist for virtual machines with one or more snapshots. This change ensures that a corrupt VMDK delta file cannot be used to crash ESX hosts.

A corrupt VMDK delta disk, or virtual machine would have to be loaded by an administrator.

VMware would like to thank Craig Marshall for reporting this issue.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4914 to this issue.

The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

#####

b. Updated Service Console package net-snmp
Net-SNMP is an implementation of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP is used by network management systems to monitor hosts.

A denial-of-service flaw was found in the way Net-SNMP processes SNMP GETBULK requests. A remote attacker who issued a specially-crafted request could cause the snmpd server to crash.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4309 to this issue.

\* hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

#####

c. Updated Service Console package libxml2
An integer overflow flaw causing a heap-based buffer overflow was found in the libxml2 XML parser. If an application linked against libxml2 processed untrusted, malformed XML content, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4226 to this issue.

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the libxml2 XML parser. If an application linked against libxml2 processed untrusted, malformed XML content, it could cause the application to enter an infinite loop.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4225 to this issue.
