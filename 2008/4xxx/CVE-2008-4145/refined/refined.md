Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4145

**Vulnerable Software:** Add a link <= 4 - beta

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The application fails to properly sanitize the `category_id` parameter in the `user_read_links.php` script before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The lack of input validation on the `category_id` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Data Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive data from the database, such as user emails and IP addresses, as demonstrated in the proof of concept.
* **Potential for other attacks:** Depending on the database configuration and the application's functionality, successful exploitation could allow the attacker to modify or delete data, potentially gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges within the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that includes SQL code within the `category_id` parameter of the `user_read_links.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
* No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code is in `user_read_links.php`:

```php
32:  $read_out_linktable="SELECT * FROM $linktable WHERE approved='1' AND category_id='$category_id' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT $start,$steps";
33:  $read_result=mysql_query($read_out_linktable);
```
The `$category_id` variable, obtained directly from the HTTP GET parameter, is inserted into the SQL query without any sanitization.

**Proof of Concept:**
The exploit-db entry provides a proof-of-concept URL:
```
http://[host]/[addalink-path]/user_read_links.php?category_id=' UNION SELECT 1,1,1,1,1,1,concat(email,0x3a,ip),1,1,1,1 FROM Linklisttable/*
```
This demonstrates how an attacker can inject a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract email and IP information from the `Linklisttable`.
