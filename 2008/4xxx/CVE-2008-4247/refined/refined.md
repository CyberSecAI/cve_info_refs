Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the `ftpd(8)` server handles long commands. It splits these long commands into multiple requests. This allows for a crafted command to be hidden within a long sequence of commands, leading to unintended execution. Specifically the usage of a `while()` loop with `fgets()` is mentioned as the issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The core vulnerability is that `ftpd` is susceptible to CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker to trick a user's browser into sending malicious FTP commands. The splitting of long commands is what enables an attacker to craft a URL that can be used to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Improper Command Handling:** The server's logic of splitting long commands without proper validation or sanitization is a significant weakness. This leads to the possibility of the server executing commands that were not explicitly intended by the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By using crafted URLs, an attacker can potentially execute commands with the privileges of the user who visits the malicious link in the browser. This can lead to changing permissions, manipulating files on the FTP server, or other administrative actions.
*   **System Compromise:** In severe cases, this vulnerability could be leveraged to compromise the underlying system if the FTP server user has broad permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Browser:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted URL (e.g., through an `<img>` tag or a link). This URL is designed to exploit the FTP server's command splitting behavior.
*   **Crafted FTP URLs:** The attacker needs to create URLs that, due to their length, force the `ftpd` server to split them into multiple commands. The last of these commands is the malicious command to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to understand how the `ftpd` server handles long commands and how to use this behavior to inject malicious commands.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking on or loading a malicious URL.
*   **Access to a Web Server:** The attacker would likely host the malicious HTML or webpage containing the crafted URL on their web server or inject it into another website to lure the victim.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   The vulnerability is present on all supported versions of FreeBSD.
*   OpenBSD already had a fix for this issue.
*   The fix involves changes to `ftpcmd.y`, `extern.h`, and `ftpd.c`
*   The `PR_TUNABLE_BUFFER_SIZE` is a tunable that could potentially make the issue worse if configured too small.

In summary, CVE-2008-4247 is a cross-site request forgery vulnerability in the FreeBSD `ftpd(8)` server, that is enabled by the server's improper handling of long commands. The vulnerability can be exploited through a web browser by tricking the user into visiting a specially crafted URL that results in arbitrary command execution on the server.
