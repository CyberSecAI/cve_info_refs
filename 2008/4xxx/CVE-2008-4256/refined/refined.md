Root cause of vulnerability:
The Charts ActiveX Control for Visual Basic 6 contains a memory corruption vulnerability.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper handling of errors for uninitialized objects within the ActiveX Control leads to memory corruption.

Impact of exploitation:
- Successful exploitation allows remote code execution.
- An attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-on user, potentially leading to complete system control with administrative privileges.

Attack vectors:
- A specially crafted web page, hosted on a malicious site or injected into a compromised site/advertisement, is used to trigger the vulnerability by invoking the ActiveX control through Internet Explorer.
- Users must be convinced to visit the malicious site, typically via a link in an email or instant message.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to create a specially crafted web page.
- Ability to host the page or inject it into a compromised site/advertisement.
- Ability to convince the victim to visit the malicious page (e.g., through social engineering).
