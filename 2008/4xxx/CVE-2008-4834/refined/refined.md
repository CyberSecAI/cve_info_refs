  "CVE-2008-4834": {
    "description": "An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol software handles specially crafted SMB packets. An attempt to exploit the vulnerability would not require authentication, allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted network message to a computer running the Server service. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the system. Most attempts to exploit this vulnerability would result in a system denial of service condition, however remote code execution is theoretically possible.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol software insufficiently validating the buffer size before writing to it.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
        "Remote Code Execution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Most attempts to exploit this vulnerability will cause an affected system to stop responding and restart.",
    "attack_vector": "By sending a specially crafted network message to a computer running the Server service.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker does not need authentication, and can exploit this vulnerability remotely."
