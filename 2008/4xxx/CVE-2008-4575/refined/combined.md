So the jhead changelog only acknowledges "potential string overflows".

John's comment in bug 271020 alludes to various other types of issues, but
specifics are unknown.  And there are some references to other overflows
that may or may not have been fixed by upstream.

So, we'd need multiple CVEs, but how many is unclear.

1 - long -cmd
2 - unsafe temp file creation
3 - "more unchecked buffers" and "unsafe buffer sized strcat's in
    ModifyDescriptComment"  [this assumes that upstream only fixed
    issue 1)
4 - shell escapes

Without knowing what exactly is being reported and fixed, it's pretty
difficult to assign CVEs, especially with phrases like "more unchecked
buffers" that could apply to anything.

Use CVE-2008-4575 for the "long -cmd" ONLY - and whatever other overflows
the upstream developer fixed.  (That is, CVE-2008-4575 is focusing on what
was fixed by upstream, not what's in the Ubuntu bug report).

Using an extremely long -cmd leads to stack protector being tripped. The ExecString and TempName should probably be dynamically allocated based on the strlen of the command.

I'd also like to point out that from a simple glance at jhead.c there are plenty of other security issues present, including unsafe temp file creation, other routines calling DoCommand, more unchecked buffers, shell escapes, unsafe buffer sized strcat's in ModifyDescriptComment, and so on. This whole codebase needs a review/rewrite.

I've notified upstream and he has responded, acknowledging these and other issues I saw from a quick scan through of the code. He plans to fix them in the coming week or two and roll a new release.

jhead 2.84 got released this month fixing the security issues. I had only a quick look at the diff and didn't check yet if all security issues are really fixed.

It would be good if someone could check the new version and preferable get it also into intrepid.

Considering dapper & hardy are LTS, could the fixed package go in at least those two since it's a security issue?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
