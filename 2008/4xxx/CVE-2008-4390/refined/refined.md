{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2008-4390",
    "description": "The Linksys WVC54GC wireless video camera insecurely sends initial configuration information over the network, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to intercept video streams, access wireless network authentication credentials, modify the device firmware, or cause a denial-of-service to the video camera.",
    "root_cause": "The Linksys WVC54GC wireless video camera uses 916/udp for remote management commands. When a certain packet is delivered to that port, the device responds with a packet that contains the majority of the device's configuration. This packet includes details such as username, password, wireless ssid, WEP key, WEP password, WPA key, and DNS server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cleartext transmission of sensitive configuration data over the network."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to obtain information to intercept video streams, access wireless network authentication credentials, modify the device firmware, or cause a denial-of-service to the video camera.",
    "attack_vector": "By delivering a specially crafted packet to 916/udp of an affected device.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted UDP packet to port 916 of the vulnerable device."
