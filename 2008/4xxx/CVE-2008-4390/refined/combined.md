## Linksys WVC54GC wireless video camera vulnerable to information disclosure

#### Vulnerability Note VU#528993

Original Release Date: 2008-12-05 | Last Revised: 2008-12-05

---

### Overview

The Linksys WVC54GC wireless video camera insecurely sends initial configuration information over the network, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to intercept video streams, access wireless network authentication credentials, modify the device firmware, or cause a denial-of-service to the video camera.

### Description

| The Linksys WVC54GC wireless video camera uses 916/udp for remote management commands. When a certain packet is delivered to that port, the device responds with a packet that contains the majority of the device's configuration. This packet includes details such as username, password, wireless ssid, WEP key, WEP password, WPA key, and DNS server. This packet is sent over the network unencrypted, which can allow an attacker to obtain these details. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By delivering a specially crafted packet to 916/udp of an affected device, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to obtain information to intercept video streams, access wireless network authentication credentials, modify the device firmware, or cause a denial-of-service to the video camera. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This vulnerability is addressed in [WVC54GC firmware version 1.25](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Download_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115417109974&packedargs=sku%3D1134691947479&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
