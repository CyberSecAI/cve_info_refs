    "Source": "exploit-db.com_1a70f251_20250126_001827.html",
    "Root cause": "Improper input validation in the 'cat' parameter of groups.php and the 'query' parameter of search_results.php.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Blind SQL Injection",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "The SQL injection vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially extract sensitive database information, modify data, or possibly gain unauthorized access. The XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft or other malicious activity.",
    "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable pages with crafted parameters.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application and have some knowledge about SQLi and web application vulnerabilities."
