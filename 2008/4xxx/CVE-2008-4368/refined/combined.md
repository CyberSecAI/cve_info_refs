#### Java for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 2

* **Java**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3638

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.4 and later, Mac OS X Server v10.5.4 and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: The Java plug-in does not block applets from launching file:// URLs. Visiting a website containing a maliciously crafted Java applet may allow a remote attacker to launch local files, which may lead to arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of URLs. This is an Apple-specific issue. Credit to Nitesh Dhanjani and Billy Rios for reporting this issue.

* **Java**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3637

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.4 and later, Mac OS X Server v10.5.4 and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: An error checking issue leading to the use of an uninitialized variable exists in the Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) provider used for generating MD5 and SHA-1 hashes. Visiting a website containing a maliciously crafted Java applet may lead to arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved error handling. This is an Apple-specific issue. Credit to Radim Marek for reporting this issue.
