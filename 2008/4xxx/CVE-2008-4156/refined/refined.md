Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4156

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `print.php` file of the CustomCMS 4.0 application.
- The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter.
- The vulnerable code is ` $q = mysql_query("SELECT * from ccms_news_comments WHERE w_id='$id'");` where the `$id` variable is directly embedded into the SQL query without proper sanitization.
- `magic_quotes_gpc` is turned off.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the SQL injection vulnerability in `print.php`. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords as demonstrated in the exploit.
- **Potential for Complete Compromise:** Depending on the database permissions, an attacker might be able to modify data, drop tables, or execute other malicious queries, leading to a complete compromise of the application and possibly the server.
- **Confidentiality Impact:** Partial due to potential access of usernames, passwords, and other data.
- **Integrity Impact:** Partial due to the potential for modifying data.
- **Availability Impact:** Partial due to the potential for the attacker to make changes that could take down or otherwise impair the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via an HTTP GET request to `print.php`, where the `id` parameter is manipulated to inject SQL code.
- **Direct Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker directly modifies the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable web server.
- **No Authentication Required:**  The exploit can be performed without prior authentication to the application.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit provided uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract username and password data from the `ccms_user` table.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" risk with CVSS Base Score 6.8/10, Exploitability Subscore 8.6/10, and Impact Subscore 6.4/10.
- The vulnerability was discovered on August 21, 2008.
- The vulnerable code indicates that magic_quotes_gpc was disabled.
