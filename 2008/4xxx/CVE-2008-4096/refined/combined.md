# phpMyAdmin: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200903-32**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, the worst of
which may allow for remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/phpmyadmin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.11.9.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.11.9.4** |

### Background

phpMyAdmin is a web-based management tool for MySQL databases.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in phpMyAdmin:

* libraries/database\_interface.lib.php in phpMyAdmin allows remote
  authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a request to
  server\_databases.php with a sort\_by parameter containing PHP sequences,
  which are processed by create\_function (CVE-2008-4096).
* Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in pmd\_pdf.php allows remote
  attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the db parameter,
  a different vector than CVE-2006-6942 and CVE-2007-5977
  (CVE-2008-4775).
* Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in phpMyAdmin allows
  remote authenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions as the
  administrator via a link or IMG tag to tbl\_structure.php with a
  modified table parameter. NOTE: this can be leveraged to conduct SQL
  injection attacks and execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-5621).
* Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in
  phpMyAdmin allow remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via
  unknown vectors related to the table parameter, a different vector than
  CVE-2008-5621 (CVE-2008-5622).

### Impact

A remote attacker may execute arbitrary code with the rights of the
webserver, inject and execute SQL with the rights of phpMyAdmin or
conduct XSS attacks against other users.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.11.9.4"
```

Use CVE-2008-4096, to be filled in later.

FYI to PHP auditors out there - add create_function() to your list of
dangerous functions.  I've seen a couple reports of vulnerabilities
related to it, and some PHP developer advocates singing its praises ("it's
like eval, but it's different!")

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- boinc-client
The boinc-client was missing return value checks for openssl function
calls. (CVE-2009-0126)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- xrdp
This update fixes multiple buffer overflows that can be exploited
remotely to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-5902, CVE-2008-5903,
CVE-2008-5904)
Additionally xrdp does not register remote session as local anymore.
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- phpMyAdmin
A version upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.11.9.4 to fix various security
bugs. (CVE-2008-2960, CVE-2008-3197, CVE-2008-1149, CVE-2008-1567,
CVE-2008-1924, CVE-2008-4096, CVE-2008-4326, CVE-2008-5621, CVE-2008-5622)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- libnasl
This update of libnasl adds missing return value checks for openssl
function calls. (CVE-2009-0125)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- moodle
Insufficient quoting of wiki page titles allowed attackers to
conduct cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2008-5432)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- net-snmp
Remote attackers could crash net-snmp via GETBULK-Request
(CVE-2008-4309).
In addition the following non-security issues have been fixed:
- typo in error message
- make OIDs longer than 256 chars work
- typo in the snmpd init script to really load all agents
- logrotate config to restart the snmptrapd as well
Affected products: SLES9, NLD9, SLES10, SLED 10
- audiofile
A heap-overflow in libaudiofile was fixed. The overflow existsed
in the WAV processing code and can be exploited to execute arbi-
trary code. (CVE-2008-5824)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, OES, SLES9, NLD9, SLES 10,
SLED10
- XFree86/xterm
XTerm evaluated various ANSI Escape sequences so that command
execution was possible if an attacker could pipe raw data to an
xterm. (CVE-2008-2383)
(It is usually not recommended to display raw data on an xterm.)
Support for Matrox G200EV/G200WB cards was added.
Affected products: OES, SLES9, NLD9
- amarok
This update of amarok fixes several integer overflows and unchecked
memory allocations that can be exploited by malformed Audible digital
audio files. These bugs could be used in a user-assisted attack sce-
nario to execute arbitrary code remotely. (CVE-2009-0135, CVE-2009-
0136)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLED10
- libpng
This update of libpng fixes the function png\_check\_keyword() that
allowed setting arbitrary bytes in the process memory to 0.
(CVE-2008-5907)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, OES, SLES9, NLD9, SLES 10,
SLED10
- sudo
This update of sudo fixes a bug that allowed - depending on the
sudoers rules - a sudo-user to execute arbitrary shell commands as
root. (CVE-2009-0034)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- avahi
Specially crafted mDNS packets could crash the Avahi daemon
(CVE-2008-5081).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLED10

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.

## phpMyAdmin Code Execution Vulnerability

Type: [Code Execution](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security.php?issue=PMASA-2008-7) — [Norman Hippert](http://www.the-wildcat.de/phpmyadmin-code-execution-vulnerability/) (wildcat at the-wildcat dot de)

* Reported: **14.09.2008**
* Published: **15.09.2008**
* Updated: **16.09.2008**
* Affected versions: **phpMyAdmin-3.0.0 RC1 and before and <= phpMyAdmin-2.11.9.0**
* Risk: **High**
* Solution: **Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.11.9.1 or newer.**

### Description

I discovered a Code execution vulnerability in RC1 release of phpMyAdmin-3.0.0

The attacker needs a valid token, but it is still a serious security problem

for shared hosting or something similar.

The problem also occurs in phpMyAdmin-2.x but it is not as easy to exploit as in 3.0

I will publish more informations some days after the patch is released

The PoC:

*server\_databases.php?pos=0&dbstats=0&sort\_by="]) OR exec('cp $(pwd)"/config.inc.php" config.txt'); //&sort\_order=desc&token=[valid token]*.

#### For the sake of completness, 2 XSS Vulnerabilities

The attacker needs also a valid token, so this is not a security problem.
The first one occured in phpMyAdmin3

On server\_sql.php the mysql\_error() is not escaped and Javascript/html get executed.

![phpMyAdmin-3.0.0 XSS](phpmyadmin3_xss1.jpg "XSS-Vulnerability")

The next one concerns the actual phpMyAdmin2 release and phpMyAdmin-3.0.0 RC1:

*server\_privileges.php?token=[valid token]&username="><plaintext>&hostname="><plaintext>&dbname=&tablename=*

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: phpMyAdmin code execution (CVE request)

Hi all,

"- (2.11.9.1)  [security] Code execution vulnerability"

<http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/downloads.php?relnotes=1>

"Welcome to this security update for phpMyAdmin 2.11.9.
Details will follow on <http://phpmyadmin.net>."

<http://www.nabble.com/phpMyAdmin-2.11.9.1-is-released-td19497113.html>

Attached patch is the fix from upstream. Judging from that (no other
information is available yet), an authenticated user can supply a crafted
sort_by parameter to server_databases.php, which will be turned in to
executed PHP code because it is passed into create_function(). It is present
at least since 2.9.1.

I would like to have a CVE id to refer to this issue.

Thijs

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1641-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                          Thijs Kinkhorst
September 20, 2008                    <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : phpmyadmin
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-3197 CVE-2008-3456 CVE-2008-3457 CVE-2008-4096

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a
tool to administrate MySQL databases over the web. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-4096

    Remote authenticated users could execute arbitrary code on the
    host running phpMyAdmin through manipulation of a script parameter.

CVE-2008-3457

    Cross site scripting through the setup script was possible in
    rare circumstances.

CVE-2008-3456

    Protection has been added against remote websites loading phpMyAdmin
    into a frameset.

CVE-2008-3197

    Cross site request forgery allowed remote attackers to create a new
    database, but not perform any other action on it.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:2.9.1.1-8.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:2.11.8.1-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

We consider this vulnerability to be serious.

### Affected Versions

Versions before 2.11.9.1.

### Solution

Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.11.9.1 or newer.
