Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-4932:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `edit.php` file of U-Mail Webmail Server.
*   It's caused by an input validation error that allows an attacker to write arbitrary data to new files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** The primary weakness is the ability to write arbitrary content to files on the server through a crafted HTTP POST request.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate user-supplied input when creating or modifying files, leading to this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By writing malicious code (e.g., a PHP web shell) to a publicly accessible directory, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Compromise of the Server:** This could lead to complete control over the web server, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted HTTP POST request sent to `/webmail/modules/filesystem/edit.php`.
*   **`path`, `name`, `content` Parameters:** The POST request includes parameters like `path` (specifying the file path), `name` (specifying the file name), and `content` (specifying the content to write).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to have valid login credentials to access the vulnerable `edit.php` functionality.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit provided shows an example of writing a PHP web shell to the `/var/www/htdocs/webmail/cmd.php` file. The web shell includes PHP code to execute system commands via a `cmd` GET parameter.
*   The request includes necessary cookies for authentication.

**Summary:**

CVE-2008-4932 describes an arbitrary file write vulnerability in U-Mail Webmail 4.91 that allows authenticated attackers to write malicious files on the server, which can be leveraged to achieve remote command execution. The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation within the `edit.php` file, which allows attackers to control the file path and contents using POST parameters.
