# CVE-2008-4108

| **Name** | CVE-2008-4108 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Tools/faqwiz/move-faqwiz.sh (aka the generic FAQ wizard moving tool) in Python 2.4.5 might allow local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a tmp$RANDOM.tmp temporary file. NOTE: there may not be common usage scenarios in which tmp$RANDOM.tmp is located in an untrusted directory. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=462326#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-09-15 12:40:44 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  A security flaw was discovered in the Python generic FAQ wizard moving tool (move-faqwiz.sh).    Relevant part of the code:   28 cut_n_pad $1 2 suffix1  29 cut_n_pad $2 1 prefix2  30 cut_n_pad $2 2 suffix2  31 tmpfile=tmp$RANDOM.tmp  32 file1=faq$prefix1.$suffix1.htp  33 file2=faq$prefix2.$suffix2.htp  Description:  An attacker could in advance create a symbolic link pointing to tmpXXXXX.tmp  (the output produced by $RANDOM is only 5 digits long), then run the Python generic FAQ wizard moving tool which would allow him to erase / truncate the target of the symbolic link to zero size.  References:  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=498899>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=462326#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-09-15 12:44:30 UTC  ``` This issue affects all versions of the Python package, as shipped with Red Hat Enteprise Linux 4, 5 and all versions of the Python package, as shipped within Fedora releases of 8, 9 and 10.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=462326#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2009-03-13 09:54:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=462326#c1)) > This issue affects all versions of the Python package, as shipped with > Red Hat Enteprise Linux 4, 5 and all versions of the Python package, > as shipped within Fedora releases of 8, 9 and 10.    Affected script is part of python source RPM for those Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora versions, but it is not shipped in any binary RPM, hence there's nothing to fix.  Closing.   ``` |  |

Hi Matthias,

in your script "Tools/faqwiz/move-faqwiz.sh" you use $RANDOM to create a
temporary file. This is very unsecure and should be replaced by mktemp.

The following patch tries to solve that and beyond that solves your
bashism bug #489648.

Please test the patch thoroughly and upload ASAP if appropiate.

Cheers,
Hauke

But it's an example.  Security is not compromised by "using" this package,
only by blindly running scripts located under
/usr/share/doc/python2.4/examples...

That's true but I think Debian should never release files with known
security issue, neither in direct use, nor as example script. Maybe
severity was set too high, but I think this is a bug and should be
solved. For my part after release if such fixes are not accepted
during freeze...

Cheers,
Hauke

Hi,

This has been assigned [CVE-2008-4108](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4108), please reference it in the changelog.

We all know what happens with example code: people copy it into their
programs. Therefore please make it a priority to fix this in lenny even
though it's an example.

thanks,
Thijs

We are aware; we retried ourselves and I contacted LaMont, who thinks it's a
buildd misconfiguration. I have contacted the mipsel buildd maintainers but
received not even an acknowledgement of my email.

If you think the security team can do anything more about this please let me
know.

I don't, or I would've done it :) phil asked me to file the bug and I
just wanted to keep the team informed. I also tried contacting the
mipsel buildd maintainer (no response yet).
