Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4044

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `readarticle.php` file of the AJ HYIP ACME script. Specifically, the `artid` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is a classic SQL injection, where user-supplied input is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords of both administrators and members. This is achieved by using `UNION SELECT` statements to concatenate and expose the data.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Depending on the database permissions and server configuration, the attacker could potentially gain further control over the database server or the application server.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The provided CVSS score indicates partial impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via HTTP requests.
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `readarticle.php` script, manipulating the `artid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server and application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the application to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have basic knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious queries.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses `UNION SELECT` statements to extract data from the `admin` and `members` tables.
- The provided exploit strings demonstrate how to retrieve usernames and passwords:
    - For admin info: `www.site.me/patch/article/readarticle.php?artid=-9999999+union+select+0,1,2,3,concat(username,0x3a,admin_password),5,6,7,8+from+admin/*`
    - For member info: `www.site.me/patch/article/readarticle.php?artid=-9999999+union+select+0,1,2,3,concat(username,0x3a,password),5,6,7,8+from+members/*`
- The `0x3a` is the hexadecimal representation of a colon (:) used as a separator.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit was discovered by Cyb3r-1sT of the InjEctOr5 T3am.
- The vulnerability exists in the `readarticle.php` script within AJ HYIP ACME, a commercial script used for managing HYIP (High-Yield Investment Program) websites.
