Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the web proxy service of the D-Link DIR-100 router.
*   The root cause is improper filtering of web requests containing large URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Input Validation Vulnerability:** The router's URL filter handler does not properly validate the length of URLs. Specifically, it fails to handle long URLs correctly.
*   **Web Restriction Filter Bypass:**  This improper handling of long URLs allows attackers to bypass the intended web restriction filters.
*   **CWE-20**: Improper Input Validation

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Integrity Impact:** The vulnerability affects the integrity of the system by allowing attackers to bypass web restriction filters. This means that content that should be blocked is not.
*   **Bypassing Security Measures:** Attackers can access blocked websites or content, thus defeating the purpose of the web filter.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, implying it does not require physical access to the affected router.
*   **Network Based:** Attackers must send malicious web requests via network to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the D-Link router in order to send malicious web requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability does not require any form of authentication for successful exploitation.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Attackers must be capable of crafting web requests with large URLs to bypass the filter.
*   **Public Exploit Availability:** A public exploit is available, lowering the bar for successful attacks

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** D-Link DIR-100 with firmware versions 1.12 and earlier.
*   **Disclosure:** Disclosed by Marc Ruef of scip AG.
*   **Exploit:** A highly functional exploit is available.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrading the firmware eliminates the vulnerability.
