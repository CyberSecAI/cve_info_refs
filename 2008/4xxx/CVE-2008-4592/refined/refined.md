Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4592

**Vulnerable Software:** Sports Clubs Web Panel 0.0.1

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI). The `index.php` script uses a parameter 'p' to include files without proper sanitization or validation, making it possible for an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application directly includes the file path specified by the `p` parameter without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, password files (`/etc/passwd`), or application source code. This can lead to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL with the `p` parameter, pointing to a file on the server they want to read.
- Example: `http://site.com/index.php?p=../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** It appears no authentication is required to exploit the LFI vulnerability.
- **Basic Understanding of File Paths:** The attacker needs to understand basic file path traversal concepts to reach the target file. Null byte injection (`%00`) is used to terminate the file path after user-controlled input, effectively bypassing any filename validation.
