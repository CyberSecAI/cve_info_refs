{
  "CVE-2008-4114": {
    "Description": "A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol software handles specially crafted SMB packets. An attempt to exploit the vulnerability would not require authentication, allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted network message to a computer running the Server service. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the computer to stop responding and restart.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol software insufficiently validating the buffer size before writing to it.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient buffer size validation in SMB protocol handling."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by sending a specially crafted SMB packet, leading to the affected system stop responding and restart.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted SMB packets over the network to a vulnerable system."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker does not need authentication, can be remote, and needs the ability to send network messages to a computer running the SMB server service."
