The provided content relates to multiple CVEs involving insecure temporary file creation or symlink attacks. Specifically, the content mentions CVE-2008-4950 but does not contain any details about it. 

Based on the provided text, the identified vulnerabilities are:

**Root cause:** The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the insecure creation of temporary files or directories, often in shared locations like `/tmp`. This insecure creation allows a malicious user to create symlinks with the same names, potentially leading to the overwriting or deletion of arbitrary files, or causing denial of service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Insecure temporary file creation:** Programs create temporary files in predictable locations (e.g. /tmp) without adequate precautions like using unique names or the O_EXCL flag with open().
   - **Symlink attack:** Attackers exploit the insecure file creation by creating symlinks with the same name as the temporary file. This allows the attacker to redirect the program's file I/O to a different location controlled by the attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary file overwrite/deletion:** Attackers can overwrite or delete system files or user files leading to data loss or system instability.
   - **Denial of service:** By overwriting or deleting critical files, attackers can make the system or specific programs unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
   - Local access to the system is required.
   - The attacker needs to be able to create files and symlinks in directories where the vulnerable programs create temporary files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create files and symlinks.
   - The attacker does not require root privileges to exploit the vulnerabilities, but may gain it in some cases.

**Note:** The content refers to a broad range of temp file issues, and some of the vulnerabilities might be specific to certain versions of the software. Also, some of the listed packages might not be vulnerable to symlink attacks due to mitigations in place, but their insecure use of temp files could still be exploitable if the attacker can control file contents by creating symlinks in advance.
