Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-4775:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the `pmd_pdf.php` file of phpMyAdmin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XSS:** The `db` parameter within the `pmd_pdf.php` file is vulnerable to XSS. This means that it is possible to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious scripts which are then executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacing the application interface
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **GET Request:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that contains the malicious script within the db parameter and sending a GET request to `pmd_pdf.php`.
*   **Specific Parameter:** The attack is targeted at the `db` parameter of the `pmd_pdf.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the XSS vulnerability in pmd_pdf.php.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Craft Malicious URL:** Attacker needs to craft a URL containing malicious javascript in the 'db' parameter of pmd_pdf.php.

**Technical Details**
* The vulnerable URL path is `http://[www.example.com]/pmd_pdf.php?db=>"><script>alert('Hadi-Kiamarsi')</script>`
* The exploit uses `register_globals=on`

**Additional Notes:**

*   This is a different vector than the XSS vulnerabilities identified in CVE-2006-6942 and CVE-2007-5977.
*   The CVSS base score is 2.6, Impact subscore is 2.9, and Exploitability subscore is 4.9. The attack complexity is considered high, confidentiality impact is none, integrity impact is partial, and availability impact is none.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of phpMyAdmin.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200903-32) indicates that the fix is in version 2.11.9.4 and later.
