Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4782

**Vulnerable Software:** AIOCP 1.4

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the `poll_id` parameter in the `cp_polls_results.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input validation on the `poll_id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the application's database. This could lead to:
    * **Data breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    * **Data modification:** Modification or deletion of data.
    * **Complete system compromise:** In some cases, depending on database privileges, the attacker might be able to gain control over the underlying operating system or escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET request:**  The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a specially crafted `poll_id` parameter, as part of a GET request to `cp_polls_results.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
* No prior authentication is required.
* The attacker can be remote.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit URL provided in the content shows how to perform a union-based SQL injection to extract the database version:

`http://[target]/[path]/public/code/cp_polls_results.php?poll_language=eng&poll_id=-0+union+select+0,1,2,version(),4,5,6--`

This payload injects SQL to bypass the original SQL query and select the version information.

**Additional Notes:**
* The Exploit-DB entry provides a proof-of-concept exploit.
* The vulnerability exists in the `cp_polls_results.php` file.
* The vulnerable parameter is `poll_id`.

This provides more details than the official CVE description (which was a placeholder).
