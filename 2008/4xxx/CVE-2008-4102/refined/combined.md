Advisory: Joomla Weak Random Password Reset Token Vulnerability
Release Date: 2008/09/11
Last Modified: 2008/09/11
Author: Stefan Esser [stefan.esser[at]sektioneins.de]
Application: Joomla <= 1.5.7
Severity: Usage of mt\_rand() and mt\_srand() for generation
of cryptographic secrets like random password
reset tokens
Risk: High
Vendor Status: Vendor has released a partially fixed Joomla 1.5.7
Reference: http://www.sektioneins.de/advisories/SE-2008-04.txt
http://www.suspekt.org/2008/08/17/mt\_srand-and-not-so-random-numbers/
Overview:
Quote from http://www.joomla.org
"Joomla is an award-winning content management system (CMS), which
enables you to build Web sites and powerful online applications.
Many aspects, including its ease-of-use and extensibility, have
made Joomla the most popular Web site software available."
During an analysis of the password reset vulnerability fixed in
Joomla 1.5.6 we realized that Joomla does not only generate random
password reset tokens with mt\_rand(), which is not secure enough
for cryptographic secrets anyway, but additionally initializes the
PRNG with a weak seed that results in less than 1.000.000 possible
password reset tokens.
Because there are only 1.000.000 possible password reset tokens an
attacker can trigger a reset of the admin password and then try out
all possible password reset tokens until he finds the correct one.
Even with a home DSL line (as used in germany) breaking into the
admin account should be possible in less than 3 hours. However
attackers are usually bouncing over much faster hosts.
In response to our report Joomla 1.5.7 was released (without sharing
the patch with us prior the release) which replaces the very weak PRNG
seeding with a new seed that is about 2^32 in strength. While this
stops the simple brute forcing attack Joomla's password reset token
is still vulnerable to mt\_rand() leak attacks and because Joomla still
seeds the PRNG with mt\_srand() it is a potential threat to other PHP
applications or plugins using mt\_rand() on the same server.
Details:
The problems arising from using mt\_(s)rand for cryptographic secrets
and possible attacks against PHP's PRNG and PHP applications using it
are explained by the blog post "mt\_(s)rand and not so random numbers"
which is available here:
http://www.suspekt.org/2008/08/17/mt\_srand-and-not-so-random-numbers/
Proof of Concept:
SektionEins GmbH is not going to release a proof of concept
exploit for this vulnerability.
Disclosure Timeline:
15. Aug 2008 - Sent notification to Joomla about the vulnerability
20. Aug 2008 - Resent notification because no reply from Joomla
20. Aug 2008 - Received confirmation
21. Aug 2008 - Received a forwarded message from vendor-sec discussing
the vulnerability - obviously Joomla shared our report
with vendor-sec without asking or notifying us.
21. Aug 2008 - In a reply to the forwarded message we recommended NOT
TO USE mt\_srand for the password reset
03. Sep 2008 - On Joomla.org appears a blog post notifying their users
that they should upgrade to Joomla 1.5.6 immediately
because of security issues with the password reset
09. Sep 2008 - The Joomla Development Team releases Joomla 1.5.7
without telling us about this or consulting us to review
their patch
11. Sep 2008 - Public Disclosure after learning about the new
Joomla 1.5.7 in the media
Recommendation:
It is recommended to upgrade not only to the latest version of Joomla
which also fixes additional vulnerabilities reported by third parties,
but also to install the Suhosin PHP extension, which comes with a
generic protection against mt\_(s)rnad vulnerabilities.
Upgrading only Joomla does not fix the whole problem.

CVE Information:
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
not assigned a name to this vulnerability yet.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
