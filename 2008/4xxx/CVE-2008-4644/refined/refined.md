{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-4644",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the `sortby` parameter within the `hits.php` file.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "SQL Injection: The `sortby` parameter from the GET request is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.",
        "IP blocking bypass: The application uses the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header to obtain the client IP, which can be easily spoofed using a proxy or by directly modifying the header of a HTTP request. The application has a block list for IP addresses that is not effective due to this issue."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to: \n- Gain unauthorized access to the database.\n- Modify or delete data in the database.\n- Potentially gain control over the server by exploiting database vulnerabilities.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request: An attacker sends a malicious HTTP GET request to the `hits.php` file with a crafted `sortby` parameter. The attacker can also use a crafted `X-Forwarded-For` header to bypass IP blocking mechanisms."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web application. No prior authentication is required."
