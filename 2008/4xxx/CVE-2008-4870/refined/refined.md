{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The dovecot.conf configuration file was world-readable, which could expose the SSL key password if the 'ssl_key_password' option was set directly in the file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default file permissions",
      "Storing sensitive data in world-readable configuration files"
    ],
    "impact": "Local users could view the SSL key password, potentially allowing them to impersonate or decrypt traffic if they also had access to the corresponding key file.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the server where Dovecot is installed.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have a local account on the system where Dovecot is installed and the dovecot.conf file is located. They also need to know that the ssl_key_password is stored within the file, and the password is of no use without the keyfile which they should not have read access to."
  },
  "resolution": "The vulnerability was addressed by adding support for the '!include_try' directive in the dovecot.conf file, allowing the 'ssl_key_password' to be moved to a separate file with restricted permissions (0600) only readable by root, which is then included in the main configuration file.",
  "additional_details": "The fix was implemented by moving the ssl_key_password to a separate file owned by root with 0600 permissions, and using the !include_try directive within the dovecot.conf file to reference this password file. The older method of using the -p option to specify a password at startup was deemed unsuitable, as it would cause a boot hang if no password was supplied."
