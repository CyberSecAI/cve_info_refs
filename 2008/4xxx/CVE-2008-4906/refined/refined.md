Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4906

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `lyrics_song.php` file of the `lyrics_menu` plugin for e107. Specifically, the `l_id` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without proper escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query. This is made possible by the application's failure to sanitize user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could also modify or delete data, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the application and its data.
- **Database Compromise:** In the worst case, the attacker could take complete control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP GET request to the `lyrics_song.php` file, passing the malicious SQL code within the `l_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker requires remote access to the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the malicious injection.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**
- The attacker can use `UNION SELECT` statements to extract data from the database.
- Example SQLi payloads are provided:
    - To extract usernames and passwords:
        `-1+union+select+1,concat(user_name,0x3a,user_password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15+from+e107_user--`
    - To extract database user and database name:
        `-1+union+select+1,2,3,concat(user(),0x3a,database()),5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17--`

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is rated as high risk with a CVSS base score of 7.5/10.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable with low attack complexity.
- Impact includes partial compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
