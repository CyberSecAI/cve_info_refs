Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-4083:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the Brim 2.0.0 application, specifically in the search functionality and the Bookmarks plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):**  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the `tasks` plugin search functionality. By injecting a malicious SQL query into the search field, an attacker can extract sensitive information like usernames and passwords from the `brim_users` table.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):** The application is vulnerable to XSS through the Bookmarks plugin. By adding a new action with malicious JavaScript in the name field, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:**
    - Exposure of sensitive data, including usernames and passwords.
    - Potential for unauthorized access to the database.
    - Possibility to further compromise the system by modifying data or executing commands.
- **XSS:**
    - Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser.
    - Session hijacking.
    - Phishing or other malicious activities that target other users of the application.
    - Website defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** The attack vector is through the `search` action within the `tasks` plugin, specifically the fields of the search form.
- **XSS:** The attack vector is through the `Bookmarks` plugin when adding new actions, specifically the name field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **SQL Injection:**
    - Attacker needs an account on the vulnerable Brim application.
    - Attacker needs to activate the "Tasks" plugin after logging in.
    - The attacker has to be able to submit a crafted SQL query to the search fields.
- **XSS:**
    - Attacker needs an account on the vulnerable Brim application.
    - Attacker needs to activate the "Bookmarks" plugin.
    - Attacker needs to be able to add a new action, including malicious javascript to the "name" field.

- The exploit was published on multiple sources like milw0rm and securityfocus.
- The vulnerable application is Brim 2.0.0.
- The exploit details a specific SQL injection payload and a XSS payload.
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.
