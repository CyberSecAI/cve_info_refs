  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2008-4471",
      "root_cause": "The CExpressViewerControl class (AdView.dll) provides an insecure SaveAS() method, which allows storing files with arbitrary extensions locally. The UpdateEngine class (LiveUpdate16.DLL) contains an ApplyPatch() method that allows launching an arbitrary executable by the second argument.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure SaveAS() method allowing arbitrary file extension saving",
        "Insecure ApplyPatch() method allowing arbitrary executable launching"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution",
      "attack_vectors": "By embedding a specially crafted DWF file containing a VBScript shell and using the vulnerable SaveAS() method, an attacker can save an arbitrary file locally (e.g., as an .hta file). Then the ApplyPatch() method is used to execute the saved file.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to lure a user into opening a malicious web page containing the exploit or trick the user into opening a malicious DWF file. An attacker can use an existing, valid DWF file and replace a .png resource with the attacker's payload. This payload will then be saved to the user's filesystem and subsequently executed."
