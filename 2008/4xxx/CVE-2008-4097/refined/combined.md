# USN-671-1: MySQL vulnerabilities

17 November 2008

MySQL vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [mysql-dfsg-5.0](/security/cves?package=mysql-dfsg-5.0) -

## Details

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table

files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use the

DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly bypass privilege

checks. This update alters table creation behaviour by disallowing the

use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY

options. ([CVE-2008-2079](/security/CVE-2008-2079), [CVE-2008-4097](/security/CVE-2008-4097) and [CVE-2008-4098](/security/CVE-2008-4098))

It was discovered that MySQL did not handle empty bit-string literals

properly. An attacker could exploit this problem and cause the MySQL

server to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3963](/security/CVE-2008-3963))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.51a-3ubuntu5.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.51a-3ubuntu5.4)

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.45-1ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.45-1ubuntu3.4)

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06.11](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06.11)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- apache2
The security update of apache2 released at 2008/11/05 packages its modules
differently (/usr/lib/apache2-prefork vs. /usr/lib/apache2-worker). This
can, in seldom cases, cause a services (like iPrint) stop working if it
expects the modules in a special directory.
New packages will be released as soon as possible.
- ipsec-tools
Remote attackers could exploit memory leaks in the 'racoon' daemon
to crash it (CVE-2008-3651, CVE-2008-3652)
Affected products: all
- kernel-bigsmp
This kernel update fixes various bugs and also several security issues:
CVE-2008-4576: Fixed a crash in SCTP INIT-ACK, on mismatch between SCTP
AUTH availability. This might be exploited remotely for a denial of
service (crash) attack.
CVE-2008-3833: The generic\_file\_splice\_write function in fs/splice.c
in the Linux kernel does not properly strip setuid and setgid bits
when there is a write to a file, which allows local users to gain the
privileges of a different group, and obtain sensitive information or
possibly have unspecified other impact, by splicing into an inode in
order to create an executable file in a setgid directory.
CVE-2008-4210: fs/open.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22 does not
properly strip setuid and setgid bits when there is a write to a file,
which allows local users to gain the privileges of a different group, and
obtain sensitive information or possibly have unspecified other impact,
by creating an executable file in a setgid directory through the (1)
truncate or (2) ftruncate function in conjunction with memory-mapped I/O.
CVE-2008-4302: fs/splice.c in the splice subsystem in the Linux
kernel before 2.6.22.2 does not properly handle a failure of the
add\_to\_page\_cache\_lru function, and subsequently attempts to unlock a page
that was not locked, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
(kernel BUG and system crash), as demonstrated by the fio I/O tool.
CVE-2008-3528: The ext[234] filesystem code fails to properly handle
corrupted data structures. With a mounted filesystem image or partition
that have corrupted dir->i\_size and dir->i\_blocks, a user performing
either a read or write operation on the mounted image or partition can
lead to a possible denial of service by spamming the logfile.
CVE-2007-6716: fs/direct-io.c in the dio subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly zero out the dio struct, which allows local users to
cause a denial of service (OOPS), as demonstrated by a certain fio test.
CVE-2008-3525: Added missing capability checks in sbni\_ioctl().
CVE-2008-3272: Fixed range checking in the snd\_seq OSS ioctl, which
could be used to leak information from the kernel.
CVE-2008-2931: The do\_change\_type function in fs/namespace.c did not
verify that the caller has the CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN capability, which allows
local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service by modifying
the properties of a mountpoint.
CVE-2008-2812: Various NULL ptr checks have been added to tty op
functions, which might have been used by local attackers to execute
code. We think that this affects only devices openable by root, so the
impact is limited.
CVE-2008-1673: Added range checking in ASN.1 handling for the CIFS and
SNMP NAT netfilter modules.
CVE-2008-3527: arch/i386/kernel/sysenter.c in the Virtual Dynamic Shared
Objects (vDSO) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.21 did not
properly check boundaries, which allows local users to gain privileges
or cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors, related to the
install\_special\_mapping, syscall, and syscall32\_nopage functions.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2
- flash-player
This update of flash-player fixes several critical security vulner-
abilities that couls lead to remote system compromise.
(CVE-2007-6243, CVE-2008-3873, CVE-2007-4324, CVE-2008-4401,
CVE-2008-4503, CVE-2008-4546)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-11.0, Novell Linux Desktop 9,
SLED 10 SP1 and SP2
- mysql
Empty bit-strings in a query could crash the MySQL server (CVE-2008-3963).
Due to another flaw users could access tables of other users (CVE-2008-
4097, CVE-2008-4098).
Affected products: all (so far only released for SLES10, others will
follow)
- ktorrent
This update of ktorrent fixes several security issues.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Subject: CVE-2008-2079: mysql allows local users to bypass certain privilege checks
Date: Fri, 09 May 2008 21:02:35 +1000
```
Package: mysql-server-5.0
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Hi

The following CVE(0) has been issued against mysql.

[CVE-2008-2079](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2079):

MySQL 4.1.x before 4.1.24, 5.0.x before 5.0.60, 5.1.x before 5.1.24, and
6.0.x before 6.0.5 allows local users to bypass certain privilege checks
by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1) DATA
DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within the MySQL
home data directory, which can point to tables that are created in the
future.

Please mention the CVE id in your changelog, if you fix the issue by an
upload.

The mysql bugreport can be found here(1).

Cheers
Steffen

   * SECURITY:
     Fix for [CVE-2008-2079](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2079): It was possible to circumvent privileges through
     the creation of MyISAM tables employing the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX
     DIRECTORY options to overwrite existing table files in the MySQL data
     directory. Use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX
     DIRECTORY is now disallowed. Patch from openSUSE 11.0, thanks to Michal
     Marek. (closes: #[480292](bugreport.cgi?bug=480292))
   * Fix build on non-linux systems, like hurd-i386. (closes: #[480362](bugreport.cgi?bug=480362))
   * Include symlinks for mysqlcheck. (closes: #[480647](bugreport.cgi?bug=480647))
 .
   [ Monty Taylor ]
   * Remove ndb_cpcd, as it is only for the NDB test suite and not useful as a
     public program.
   * Fix debian-start.inc.sh for table names with characters needing quotes.
     Thanks Felix Rublack! (closes: #[480525](bugreport.cgi?bug=480525), #[481154](bugreport.cgi?bug=481154), #[481303](bugreport.cgi?bug=481303), #[484012](bugreport.cgi?bug=484012))
   * Delete mysql-common.README.Debian. Nothing in it was relevant, and the
     useful information is in mysql-server anyway. (closes: #[480940](bugreport.cgi?bug=480940))
   * Remove a spurious HOME= in logrotate script.

I don't believe that the patch applied to address this bug was sufficient.  In
preparing the stable update I initially applied it, before finding two things:

First, fn_format() only calls readlink() once on the entire path, not on any
component thereof; hence it will only actually detect when the last component
of a path was a symlink.  Exploiting this merely requires adding another path
component below the symlink path -- for example:

	$ ls -l /tmp/foo
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 aqua 1000 14 Jul  3 05:36 /tmp/foo -> /var/lib/mysql

	mysql> use test1 ;
	Database changed

	mysql> create table t (a int) data directory '/tmp/foo' ;
	ERROR 1210 (HY000): Incorrect arguments to DATA DIRECORY

	mysql> create table t (a int) data directory '/tmp/foo/mysql' ;
	Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

	$ ls -l /var/lib/mysql/mysql/t.MYD
	-rw-rw---- 1 mysql mysql 0 Jul  3 07:27 /var/lib/mysql/mysql/t.MYD

Second, even if fn_format() did fully resolve symlinks in the path, its output
is actually ignored; this is an except from 92_SECURITY_CVE-2008-2079.dpatch
in mysql-dfsg-5.0 5.0.51a-9:

	+static bool test_if_data_home_dir(const char *dir)
	+{
	[...]
	+  (void) fn_format(path, dir, "", "",
	+                   (MY_RETURN_REAL_PATH|MY_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS));
	+  dir_len= unpack_dirname(conv_path, dir);
	[...]
	+    else if (!memcmp(conv_path, mysql_unpacked_real_data_home, home_dir_len))
	+      DBUG_RETURN(1);

fn_format reads the potentially hostile 'dir' and writes the marginally
readlink()'ed result to 'path'.  But unpack_dirname is passed 'dir' again, not
'path', so it's the origianl string which is used in the subsequent
comparison.

In terms of exploitability, this allows any user with permissions to create
tables in a db the ability to read from, write to and delete tables from any
other database within the same mysql instance.

Hi Devin!

Looks like upstream patch is incomplete.  Have you already notified
upstream about the problem?

> In terms of exploitability, this allows any user with permissions to
> create tables in a db the ability to read from, write to and delete
> tables from any other database within the same mysql instance.

Can you possibly explain this a little closer?  MySQL should not allow
you to overwrite existing tables via DATA/INDEX DIRECTORY directives.
So you can only get access to tables created in the future, if you can
predict their names.  Or have you managed to escalate privileges to
already existing tables using this flaw?

Thanks!

Not yet -- I still need to hand verify it against a pristine upstream; it's
reproducible with 5.0.51a from Sid, but the implementation of the path check
has changed significantly from the original patch.  I'll look into that once I
get a workable fix out for etch.

Sorry, I was taking the temporal part of the attack as read -- yes, the attack
is still based on creating the hostile tables before the victim database does.

Here's a patch I'm building for an Etch update to address the problem.  It's
pretty close to the same one used in the first fix to this bug, except that it
adds a call to realpath() to resolve all components of the path, and fixes the
argument passing so as not to throw the resolved forms away.

Subject: Re: CVE request: MySQL incomplete fix for
 CVE-2008-2079

Hi!

While we are on the MySQL, following issue should probably get CVE id
as well...

CVE id CVE-2008-2079 was assigned to MySQL flaw that allowed attackers
to get access to the tables created by other database users in the
future.

Devin Carraway of Debian noticed, that the upstream fix can be defeated
by local users via directory symlinks:

  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=480292#25>

Patch used in the DSA-1608-1 differed from the upstream fix by addition
of realpath call to expand all symlinks in the path specified in DATA /
INDEX DIRECTORY directives:

  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=480292#42>

Which is also possible to defeat, as described by Devin in the upstream
bug report related to the original issue:

  <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32167>
  comment dated with "[18 Jul 9:43]"

Upstream addressed the problem by doing the check at open time, not
only at creation time, and the fix is mentioned in the 5.0.70 (and
possibly other) release notes (using original CVE id):

  <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/releasenotes-es-5-0-70.html>
