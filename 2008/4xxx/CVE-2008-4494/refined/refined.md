Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4494

**Vulnerability:** Blind SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists within the `completed-advance.php` script of TorrentTrader Classic version 1.04. The script's `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker cannot directly see the results of their queries in the response, but can still infer information by observing application behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by crafting malicious SQL queries. The example exploit provided in the content shows how the attacker could potentially determine the number of user passwords stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector is through manipulating the `id` parameter within the `completed-advance.php` script via a GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges or user authentication is mentioned. The attacker doesn't need to have prior access to the database or the server.

**Technical Details:**
*   The exploit example demonstrates the use of SQL injection to extract the number of user passwords using `ascii(SUBSTRING((SELECT Count(password) FROM users LIMIT 1,1)1,1)`. This indicates that the attacker can run arbitrary SQL queries and infer information based on the server's response (even though it might not directly display the results of the query).

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit was publicly released on 2008-10-07.
* The vulnerable application is TorrentTrader Classic version 1.04.
