  "CVE-2008-4101": {
    "description": "Insufficient sanitization can lead to Vim executing arbitrary commands when performing the ``keywordprg'' functionality.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input when constructing shell commands for keyword/tag lookups.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper sanitization of shell command strings",
      "Insufficient escaping of arguments for Ex commands",
      "Use of shell without sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the user running Vim.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Using the 'K' command with a crafted keyword that contains shell commands.",
      "Using the 'K' command with a crafted keyword that includes command line switches for the keyword program (e.g., man --pager)",
      "Using the Control-] or g] commands with crafted tag lookups that include additional Ex commands."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to trick a user into opening a crafted file or editing with a specific configuration and then use 'K' command or tag lookups. The ability to control the content of the buffer being edited.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability also exists in tag lookups initiated via Control-] and g]. The fix for (2) inserts a hardcoded double-dash which may break some man command implementations. Vulnerabilities due to using unknown shell or man commands are difficult to resolve and no fix is provided."
