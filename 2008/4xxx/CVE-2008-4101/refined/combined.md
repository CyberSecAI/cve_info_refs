Insufficient sanitization can lead to Vim executing arbitrary commands
when performing the ``keywordprg'' functionality. Ben Schmidt
discovered this vulnerability[1].
Attack vectors:
(1) K -- arbitrary shell command execution via additional shell
commands (insufficient sanitization of a shell command string)
(2) K -- arbitrary shell command execution via man(1) command line
switches (argument for man can be a command line switch, man
arguments can execute programs)
(3) , g] -- arbitrary Vim Script command execution via additional
Ex statements (insufficient escaping of an argument)
(4) Unknown vulnerabilities stemming from using unknown shell, and,
by extension, an unknown man command
This patch solves (1) and (3), and partially solves (2). Unfortunately,
the fix for (2) is a hardcoded double-dash (--) inserted between the
program name and the command line arguments. This will break for man
commands that do not understand double-dash. A more clever solution is
needed.
The discussion of (the feasibility of) a fix for (4) has been going on
for some time. All proposed solutions seem to have irreconcilable
downsides.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=461927#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-09-11 14:11:12 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Ben Schmidt has discovered the following security flaw in Vim, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. Insufficient sanitization can lead to Vim executing arbitrary commands when performing keyword or tag lookup.  Flaw description pasted from original rdancer.org report (see [1]):  3.1. Keyword Lookup -- The ``K'' Command 3.1.1. Shell Commands and Ex Commands  Because the string passed to the shell for execution is not sanitized, it is possible to specify arbitrary shell commands where Vim expects an argument for the keyword program.  Same applies to arbitrary Ex commands.  3.1.2. Keyword Program Command Line Switches  It is possible to specify command line switches for the keyword program in place of the argument.  The gravity of this vulnerability depends on the keyword program selected.  GNU man, the default keyword program in many installations, supports for example the ``--pager'' option (cf. the GNU man(1) manual page).  This allows arbitrary command execution.  3.2. Tag Lookup -- the ``Control-]'' and ``g]'' Commands  Insufficient sanitization of an Ex command argument allows specifying additional arbitrary Ex commands in place of the argument.  3.3. Unknown Shell/Keyword Program  Because the syntax of the shell that is being used to execute the commands is not known beforehand, there may be other unknown vulnerabilities, that are present depending on the shell being used. Ditto for the man(1) program, and other keyword programs.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 3.0--current, possibly older  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. See part "4.EXPLOIT" from the original rdancer.org report [1]    Actual results: Arbitrary code execution possible  Expected results: No security flaw present.  References:  [1] <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-K.html>  Proposed patch:  Report: <http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/msg/dd32ad3a84f36bb2>  Patch:     <http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/attach/dd32ad3a84f36bb2/K-arbitrary-command-execution.patch?part=2>  RH SRT official statement:  This issue affects all versions of the vim-enhanced package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4 and 5 and within Fedora releases of 8, 9 and 10.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=461927#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-09-12 12:20:56 UTC  ``` The patch mentioned above is incomplete. Jan Minar has provided v3 of  the patch, for the K-shell command Vim issue, available at:  <http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/attach/9290f26f9bc11b33/K-arbitrary-command-execution.patch.v3?part=2>  Yet another Vim upstream patch, also facing this issue is:  <http://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/7.2/7.2.010>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=461927#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-10-06 08:28:31 UTC  ``` More detailed steps to reproduce the "xclock" issue:  1, Open a new file via Vim: vim /tmp/somenewfile 2, In Vim normal mode type: :set iskeyword=;,@ 3, Switch to Vim insert mode and type/insert into file: ;xclock 4, Switch back to Vim normal mode and with cursor present on the    "xclock" substring press the "K" key  Actual result:  The xclock command is executed / displayed.  Expected result:  The manual page for the 'xclock' command should be displayed.  More detailed steps to reproduce the creation of "pwned" file issue:  1, Open a new file via Vim: vim /tmp/anothernewfile 2, In normal Vim mode type: :set iskeyword=1-255 3, Switch to Vim insert mode and type/insert into file: ;date->pwned 4, Switch back to Vim normal mode and with cursor present on the    "date" substring press the "K" key  Actual result:  File with name "pwned" is created in cwd:  # ls -l pwned -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Oct  6 10:19 pwned  Expected result:  No file created.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=461927#c6)  Red Hat Product Security    2009-01-09 08:36:16 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0580.html>   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0617.html>   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0618.html>  Fedora (updated to upstream 7.2.060):    <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F9/FEDORA-2008-10587>   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F10/FEDORA-2008-10644>   ``` |  |

Use CVE-2008-4101

What about the ``Control-]'' and ``g]'' Commands (section 3.2)?  On the
surface, the patch seems to only be related to the K command.

when using the K command. Due to normal settings for iskeyword this won't usually
show up for K, but will for {Visual}K if you, e.g., highlight a URL with a # in it
and use K on it (with keywordprg set to 'firefox' or something--'open' for me on
Mac OS X--this makes sense: in fact it is very useful). If there is no alternate
file you get an error in Vim, but if there is one, nonsense just gets passed to
the shell. It should be checked that the keyword is properly shell-escaped, too. I
can't quickly think of a way to easily exploit this one, so I don't think it's a
security risk, but it's definitely a bug.

This is very much a security bug. One that allows arbitrary shell
commands execution.

Your usage is a very good example, because one in general doesn't
control the URL of the object one wants to access. According to my
reading of RFC 3986, valid URI characters, on top of letters and
numbers, are:

:,?#[]@!$&'()\*+;=.\_~/%

Opening the following URL using the K command will launch the
xclock(1x) program:

<http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=&xclock&>

But, of course, it's much worse: Since the URL is inside a buffer, we
can assume the whole of the buffer can be controlled by the attacker.
They can use a modeline to set 'iskeyword' to contain any characters
needed for a particular shell command:

/\* We use an obscure glibc function -- check out the man page! \*/
 clockface = (xclock&)pwnme(a, b, x + y);
 [...]
 /\* vim:iskeyword:a-z,&,),(: \*/

Cheers,
Jan.

Currently some characters are escaped, such as a space. I suppose # and

shellescape(). I'll make a note in the todo list.

Without being properly shell-escaped, yes. I hadn't tested that aspect,
and in my mind, my security comment didn't refer to it, but assumed
escaping was done.

In the actual email, the security comment does seem to refer to the
shell escaping...

And in real life it seems the keyword isn't fully escaped, though it
partly is. Wrong type(s) of escaping perhaps.

Ouch.

Ben.

Pasting this into the SeaMonkey location bar opens a Google page.
Hitting K on it in gvim with 'keywordprg' set to "seamonkey" invokes
":!seamonkey http" which gives a page from the site <http://www.http.com/>
In neither case do I see any xclock process, even though the program is

You need to have 'iskeyword' set to a sensible value. Sensible, that
is, for handling URLs. A version using a modeline to set the
'iskeyword':

<http://www.example.com>&xclock&
 vim: iskeyword=58,?,#,[,],@,!,$,&,',(,),\*,+,44,;,=,45,.,\_,~,/,48-57,A-Z,a-z,%

The above will of course not work. The following will:

/\* We use an obscure glibc function -- check out the man page! \*/

clockface = &(xclock)&pwnme (a, b, x + y);
 /\* :vim:iskeyword=a-z,&,),(: \*/

This time Vim says ":!seamonkey [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)&xclock& which apparently
doesn't do anything. Pasting the URL into the Location bar gives

[www.example.com](http://www.example.com)&xclock& could not be found. Please check the name and
try again.

Jan got the exploit right, but formatted his modeline wrong. Try this document:

/\* We use an obscure glibc function -- check out the man page! \*/

clockface = &(xclock)&pwnme (a, b, x + y);
/\* vim: set iskeyword=a-z,&,),(: \*/

Make sure ":verbose set isk?" correctly says
iskeyword=a-z,&,),(
 Last set from modeline

place your cursor on 'pwnme', and press K. xclock appears.

> Well, I couldn't reproduce your exploit with the Mozilla SeaMonkey

The browser being used has nothing to do with the exploit; it's all in
the shell expansions before the browser is launched. In fact, in
cases like this I don't think we should be using the shell at all, for
reasons just like this one. I can see no real argument for why K
ought to behave like:
exe '!' . &kp . ' ' . expand("<cword>")

Is there any reason why we would ever want shell syntax to affect
keyword lookups? I think that K ought to behave more like
execlp(&kp, &kp, expand("<cword>"), (char \*)NULL);
Of course, this is muddled C and Vimscript pseudo-code, but you get the idea.

OTOH, :! probably ought to continue using the shell so that you can
do, for instance,
:!ls | grep foo

I bet you're in gvim, right, Tony? I expect you're encountering the
"can't run processes in the background" problem that a number of users
have commented on recently, and for that reason not seeing the exploit.
In console Vim you will see it, or if you just do

[www.example.com](http://www.example.com)&xclock

which will wait for xclock to exit (close it!) before returning to Vim,
rather than deallocating the pty as soon as control returns to vim, thus
killing all the processes started by the command (both the browser and
the clock--though if you already have Seamonkey open, the new process
will just send it a message and exit, I believe, much like gvim
--remote).

Yeah, this is the kind of exploit where you have to tell the user to do
something stupid and them blame Vim that the user is stupid.

The command executed can be an shell alias. The command may not be in
$PATH. And a few other reasons we don't see right now.

Yeah, not a terribly serious exploit, more of an inconvenience when a
command does something other than you'd expect because of shell
expansion.

execlp() handles commands not in $PATH just fine, as long as its first
parameter is an absolute or relative path, rather than just a
filename. And a shell alias being used there is definitely not a good
thing - and is not done by default. If you want to replace or create
a program, you create a script, if you want to change the way a
program is used interactively, you use an alias. Aliases are
certainly not designed to ever be called from an external program, and
forcing bash to pretend to be an interactive shell when it's not, in
fact, being used interactively, just for the sake of expanding
aliases, is a Bad Thing.

I agree aliases should be interactive, and not used here. However, $PATH
and so on is often set/adjusted from shell startup files, and
particularly when using gvim started via GUI, etc., this can be relevant.

On the other side, shell escaping when exactly which shell is being used
is not known is a nightmare, too.

I think it's one of those issues where there are so many good arguments
on both sides, it comes down to a matter of opinion.

PATH should be set from .profile, not from .bashrc - Interactive vs
noninteractive should have nothing to do with whether or not PATH is
correct; either your x session or your login shell at a tty should set
up such things.

And it's here that I'm convinced we'll be able to find a ton of
security vulnerabilities as soon as someone with some security
expertise decides to look.

In that vein, perhaps using the shell should be an option... but
doubtless the best default behavior is to use system(3) for places
like :! where shell expansion is good,and execlp() for those places
where we decidedly don't want any shell expansion. Relying on uniform
escaping required for /bin/sh is still not terribly easy, but it's a
much less moving target than escaping for every possible shell... It
just strikes me that vim's present use of the user's shell is
inherently impossible to sanitize, and thus inherently insecure for at
least the simplistic "file name has a command embedded" sort of
attack...

Ah, yes, this time I see a clock but I can't give it focus, even by
clicking its titlebar; and at the bottom of the gvim window I see

:! seamonkey &(xclock)&pwnme
/bin/bash: pwnme: command not found

shell returned 127

But you got to have the cursor "near enough" to where the "exploiter"
wants it -- previously I put it on clockface and it didn't work -- and
then the user has to manually hit K. Looks to me like the so-called
"exploit" requires quite some cooperation by the user.

Best regards,
Tony.

Are you sure that where we used to call the shell, you want to replace
the whole Vim process by something else unless an error occurs?

Thanks again to Ben for reporting this.

It's not just the K command. The <C-]> and g] commands are vulnerable
too. Patch attached.

Attack vectors:

(1) K -- arbitrary shell command execution via additional shell
 commands (insufficient sanitization of a shell command string)
 (the original vulnerability)

(2) K -- arbitrary shell command execution via man(1) command line
 switches (such as ``--pager'' in GNU man -- cf. manpage)

(3) <C-]>, g] -- arbitrary Vim Script command execution via additional
 Ex statements (insufficient escaping of an argument)

(4) Unknown vulnerabilities stemming from using unknown shell, and,
 by extension, an unknown man command

This patch solves (1) and (3), and partially solves (2). Unfortunately,
the fix for (2) is a hardcoded double-dash (--) inserted between the
program name and the command line arguments. This will break for man
commands that do not understand double-dash. A more clever solution is
needed.

The discussion of (the feasibility of) a fix for (4) has been going on
for some time. All proposed solutions seem to have irreconcilable
downsides.

Cheers,
Jan.

Maybe you should set a config-time option (or create one) to avoid any
interaction with the shell?

Even better: If you don't want ever to become the victim of any exploit,
turn your computer off at the wall switch and leave it off.

That's what I thought, too. But vim\_strsave\_shellescape() is
documented to return NULL when out of memory:

src/misc2.c:

1279 \* Returns the result in allocated memory, NULL if we have run out.
 1280 \*/
 1281 char\_u \*
 1282 vim\_strsave\_shellescape(string, do\_special)

Well, if you have run out of memory, it's probably too late to allocate

Yes, but... in the case of the line in question:
printf("ERROR: out of memory\n");
Jan wasn't trying to dynamically allocate more memory from the heap;
he was printing out a string that was already allocated by the OS
before vim even reached its main() function. In C, unlike in some
interpreted language like, IIRC, Python, all string literals are
loaded into memory before the program gets control, and any reference
to them is just a matter of dereferencing a pointer.

I haven't studied this example, but as I understand it, the suggestion is that I
could send you a file with a message like "What's the deal with this weird message
that Vim gives? Open file xxx and search for yyy then press K."

Jan is saying (I think) that following those instructions could execute malware.

Sure, it will never happen to me or you, but if we were discussing Microsoft Word,
most people would have no hesitation in declaring that such a vulnerability (press a
key in a document to get owned) is just NOT acceptable.

We aren't talking about mapping K to execute "system('dodgyfile')". K is performing
its default function, but that function could exploit you if executed on certain
text, with a certain file present.

If my understanding is correct, I don't think it's reasonable to write this off with
the "switch power off" joke (if I've got this wrong, please correct me).

Once again, thanks Jan!

Thanks for the feedback.

My understanding of how vim malloc() wrappers worked was incorrect.
I've updated the patch. These are the changes from the previous
version:

Earlier in this function, the code does just return when out of
memory, so that's what I'll do as well. The realloc() return value
was not checked, so I fixed that as well. The updated patch (version
2) is attached.

Please! It's an editor. What kind of vulnerabilities would you
expect? You have to open a file, have a reasonable feature set
enabled, and do something. The real question is, why does the impact
always have to be arbitrary Ex/shell commands execution? And why are
there so many?

But it's a feature really: We all know it can take a long time for a
package maintainer to include a patch. Or perhaps, said package
maintainer thinks our patch sucks. Pperhaps he's even right! Not to
worry. With all these vulnerabilities, as long as they're is using
Vim, we can have all our patches included \_as soon as they view them\_.
 We can even have the packages built and uploaded at the same time!

Cheers,
Jan.

After applying this patch to Vim 7.2, I got following errors while

trying to use K command (and shell also freezes after getting the

errors). I tried to reproduce them with a stable scenario, but

couldn't find a reasonable one. And also, K command sometimes works as

expected, too.

I don't know if they're Vim-related or am I missing something, though.

I'd be happy if you can give me one or two clues.

No manual entry for xml version="1.0" ?>

and another one:

No manual entry for appName = "Kaptan Wallpaper"

Press ENTER or type command to continueVim: Caught deadly signal ABRT

Vim: preserving files...

This looks like you are visually selecting ``xml version="1.0" ?>'',
and pressing K. man says "No manual entry for <foo>", as it does,
then returns 16.

> Press ENTER or type command to continueVim: Caught deadly signal SEGV

Since the command has already been executed, this is past the function
that the patch affects, and therefore seems like an unrelated bug. A
backtrace would be nice.

Same as above. Why would anybody think there were a manual entry for
``appName = "Kaptan Wallpaper"'' is not clear to me...

If you can't reproduce the behaviour 100% of time, it's still better
to describe it. Otherwise, it's just guesswork.

Cheers,
Jan.

Thanks for reporting this. Forget my last email. This is the fix:

/\*
 \* Now grab the chars in the identifier
 \*/
 ! if (cmdchar == 'K' && !kp\_help)
 ! {
 ! /\* Sanitize properly \*/
-! if ((p = vim\_strsave\_shellescape(ptr, TRUE)) == NULL ||
-! (char\_u \*)vim\_realloc(buf, STRLEN(buf) + STRLEN(p) + 1) == NULL)
+! if ((p = vim\_strsave\_shellescape(ptr, TRUE)) == NULL)
 ! /\* Out of memory \*/
 ! return;
+! if ((buf = (char\_u \*)vim\_realloc(buf, STRLEN(buf) + STRLEN(p) + 1))
+! == NULL)
+! {
+! /\* Out of memory \*/
+! /\* XXX Print an Out of Memory error message here \*/
+! vim\_free(p);
+! return;
+! }
 ! STRCAT(buf, p);
 ! vim\_free(p);
 ! }

The updated patch (version 3) attached.

Cheers,
Jan.

vim security update (RHSA-2008-0618)

Original Release Date: November 26, 2008

Last Revised: November 26, 2008

Number: ASA-2008-457

Risk Level: None

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Vim (Visual editor IMproved) is an updated and improved version of
the vi
editor.

* Several input sanitization flaws were found in Vim's keyword
  and tag
  handling. If Vim looks up a document's maliciously crafted tag or
  keyword,
  it is possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running
  Vim.

* Several input sanitization flaws were found in various Vim
  system
  functions. If a user opens a specially crafted file, it is possible to
  execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names [CVE-2008-4101](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2712) and [CVE-2008-2712](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4101) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat
Linux:

* [https://rhn.redha
  t.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0618.html](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0618.html)

=== Content from groups.google.com_59b1fd05_20250125_033730.html ===
Insufficient sanitization can lead to Vim executing arbitrary commands
when performing the ``keywordprg'' functionality. Ben Schmidt
discovered this vulnerability[1].
Attack vectors:
(1) K -- arbitrary shell command execution via additional shell
commands (insufficient sanitization of a shell command string)
(2) K -- arbitrary shell command execution via man(1) command line
switches (argument for man can be a command line switch, man
arguments can execute programs)
(3) , g] -- arbitrary Vim Script command execution via additional
Ex statements (insufficient escaping of an argument)
(4) Unknown vulnerabilities stemming from using unknown shell, and,
by extension, an unknown man command
This patch solves (1) and (3), and partially solves (2). Unfortunately,
the fix for (2) is a hardcoded double-dash (--) inserted between the
program name and the command line arguments. This will break for man
commands that do not understand double-dash. A more clever solution is
needed.
The discussion of (the feasibility of) a fix for (4) has been going on
for some time. All proposed solutions seem to have irreconciliable
downsides.

It's not clear whether to merge this with CVE-2008-4101 - if the original
incomplete patch made it into some distro or public version of vim then
OK, but we generally don't distinguish between patches (CVE-wise) when
they're all part of the same bug discussion and there hasn't been a
release.

#####

##### 3. Problem Description

a. Updated OpenSSL package for the Service Console fixes a security issue.
OpenSSL 0.9.7a-33.24 and earlier does not properly check the return value from the EVP\_VerifyFinal function, which could allow a remote attacker to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature for DSA and ECDSA keys.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-5077 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

#####

b. Update bind package for the Service Console fixes a security issue.
A flaw was discovered in the way Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) checked the return value of the OpenSSL DSA\_do\_verify function. On systems using DNSSEC, a malicious zone could present a malformed DSA certificate and bypass proper certificate validation, allowing spoofing attacks.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2009-0025 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

#####

c. Updated vim package for the Service Console addresses several security issues.
Several input flaws were found in Visual editor IMproved's (Vim) keyword and tag handling. If Vim looked up a document's maliciously crafted tag or keyword, it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4101 to this issue.
A heap-based overflow flaw was discovered in Vim's expansion of file name patterns with shell wildcards. An attacker could create a specially crafted file or directory name, when opened by Vim causes the application to stop responding or execute arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-3432 to this issue. Several input flaws were found in various Vim system functions. If a user opened a specially crafted file, it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-2712 to this issue. A format string flaw was discovered in Vim's help tag processor. If a user was tricked into executing the "helptags" command on malicious data, arbitrary code could be executed with the permissions of the user running VIM.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-2953 to this issue.

# Bug with v\_K and potentially K command

when using the K command. Due to normal settings for iskeyword this won't usually
show up for K, but will for {Visual}K if you, e.g., highlight a URL with a # in it
and use K on it (with keywordprg set to 'firefox' or something--'open' for me on
Mac OS X--this makes sense: in fact it is very useful). If there is no alternate
file you get an error in Vim, but if there is one, nonsense just gets passed to
the shell. It should be checked that the keyword is properly shell-escaped, too. I
can't quickly think of a way to easily exploit this one, so I don't think it's a
security risk, but it's definitely a bug.

This is very much a security bug. One that allows arbitrary shell
commands execution.

Your usage is a very good example, because one in general doesn't
control the URL of the object one wants to access. According to my
reading of RFC 3986, valid URI characters, on top of letters and
numbers, are:

:,?#[]@!$&'()\*+;=.\_~/%

Opening the following URL using the K command will launch the
xclock(1x) program:

<http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=&xclock&>

But, of course, it's much worse: Since the URL is inside a buffer, we
can assume the whole of the buffer can be controlled by the attacker.
They can use a modeline to set 'iskeyword' to contain any characters
needed for a particular shell command:

/\* We use an obscure glibc function -- check out the man page! \*/
 clockface = (xclock&)pwnme(a, b, x + y);
 [...]
 /\* vim:iskeyword:a-z,&,),(: \*/

Cheers,
Jan.

Without being properly shell-escaped, yes. I hadn't tested that aspect,
and in my mind, my security comment didn't refer to it, but assumed
escaping was done.

In the actual email, the security comment does seem to refer to the
shell escaping...

And in real life it seems the keyword isn't fully escaped, though it
partly is. Wrong type(s) of escaping perhaps.

Ouch.

You need to have 'iskeyword' set to a sensible value. Sensible, that
is, for handling URLs. A version using a modeline to set the
'iskeyword':

<http://www.example.com>&xclock&
 vim: iskeyword=58,?,#,[,],@,!,$,&,',(,),\*,+,44,;,=,45,.,\_,~,/,48-57,A-Z,a-z,%

The above will of course not work. The following will:

/\* We use an obscure glibc function -- check out the man page! \*/

clockface = &(xclock)&pwnme (a, b, x + y);
 /\* :vim:iskeyword=a-z,&,),(: \*/

This time Vim says ":!seamonkey [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)&xclock& which apparently
doesn't do anything. Pasting the URL into the Location bar gives

Jan got the exploit right, but formatted his modeline wrong. Try this document:

/\* We use an obscure glibc function -- check out the man page! \*/

clockface = &(xclock)&pwnme (a, b, x + y);
/\* vim: set iskeyword=a-z,&,),(: \*/

Make sure ":verbose set isk?" correctly says
iskeyword=a-z,&,),(
 Last set from modeline

place your cursor on 'pwnme', and press K. xclock appears.

> Well, I couldn't reproduce your exploit with the Mozilla SeaMonkey

The browser being used has nothing to do with the exploit; it's all in
the shell expansions before the browser is launched. In fact, in
cases like this I don't think we should be using the shell at all, for
reasons just like this one. I can see no real argument for why K
ought to behave like:
exe '!' . &kp . ' ' . expand("<cword>")

Is there any reason why we would ever want shell syntax to affect
keyword lookups? I think that K ought to behave more like
execlp(&kp, &kp, expand("<cword>"), (char \*)NULL);
Of course, this is muddled C and Vimscript pseudo-code, but you get the idea.

OTOH, :! probably ought to continue using the shell so that you can
do, for instance,
:!ls | grep foo

I bet you're in gvim, right, Tony? I expect you're encountering the
"can't run processes in the background" problem that a number of users
have commented on recently, and for that reason not seeing the exploit.
In console Vim you will see it, or if you just do

[www.example.com](http://www.example.com)&xclock

which will wait for xclock to exit (close it!) before returning to Vim,
rather than deallocating the pty as soon as control returns to vim, thus
killing all the processes started by the command (both the browser and
the clock--though if you already have Seamonkey open, the new process
will just send it a message and exit, I believe, much like gvim
--remote).

Yeah, this is the kind of exploit where you have to tell the user to do
something stupid and them blame Vim that the user is stupid.

The command executed can be an shell alias. The command may not be in
$PATH. And a few other reasons we don't see right now.

Yeah, not a terribly serious exploit, more of an inconvenience when a
command does something other than you'd expect because of shell
expansion.

execlp() handles commands not in $PATH just fine, as long as its first
parameter is an absolute or relative path, rather than just a
filename. And a shell alias being used there is definitely not a good
thing - and is not done by default. If you want to replace or create
a program, you create a script, if you want to change the way a
program is used interactively, you use an alias. Aliases are
certainly not designed to ever be called from an external program, and
forcing bash to pretend to be an interactive shell when it's not, in
fact, being used interactively, just for the sake of expanding
aliases, is a Bad Thing.

I agree aliases should be interactive, and not used here. However, $PATH
and so on is often set/adjusted from shell startup files, and
particularly when using gvim started via GUI, etc., this can be relevant.

On the other side, shell escaping when exactly which shell is being used
is not known is a nightmare, too.

I think it's one of those issues where there are so many good arguments
on both sides, it comes down to a matter of opinion.

PATH should be set from .profile, not from .bashrc - Interactive vs
noninteractive should have nothing to do with whether or not PATH is
correct; either your x session or your login shell at a tty should set
up such things.

And it's here that I'm convinced we'll be able to find a ton of
security vulnerabilities as soon as someone with some security
expertise decides to look.

In that vein, perhaps using the shell should be an option... but
doubtless the best default behavior is to use system(3) for places
like :! where shell expansion is good,and execlp() for those places
where we decidedly don't want any shell expansion. Relying on uniform
escaping required for /bin/sh is still not terribly easy, but it's a
much less moving target than escaping for every possible shell... It
just strikes me that vim's present use of the user's shell is
inherently impossible to sanitize, and thus inherently insecure for at
least the simplistic "file name has a command embedded" sort of
attack...

[...]

Ah, yes, this time I see a clock but I can't give it focus, even by
clicking its titlebar; and at the bottom of the gvim window I see

:! seamonkey &(xclock)&pwnme
/bin/bash: pwnme: command not found

shell returned 127

But you got to have the cursor "near enough" to where the "exploiter"
wants it -- previously I put it on clockface and it didn't work -- and
then the user has to manually hit K. Looks to me like the so-called

Are you sure that where we used to call the shell, you want to replace
the whole Vim process by something else unless an error occurs?

Thanks again to Ben for reporting this.

It's not just the K command. The <C-]> and g] commands are vulnerable
too. Patch attached.

Attack vectors:

(1) K -- arbitrary shell command execution via additional shell
 commands (insufficient sanitization of a shell command string)
 (the original vulnerability)

(2) K -- arbitrary shell command execution via man(1) command line
 switches (such as ``--pager'' in GNU man -- cf. manpage)

(3) <C-]>, g] -- arbitrary Vim Script command execution via additional
 Ex statements (insufficient escaping of an argument)

(4) Unknown vulnerabilities stemming from using unknown shell, and,
 by extension, an unknown man command

This patch solves (1) and (3), and partially solves (2). Unfortunately,
the fix for (2) is a hardcoded double-dash (--) inserted between the
program name and the command line arguments. This will break for man
commands that do not understand double-dash. A more clever solution is
needed.

The discussion of (the feasibility of) a fix for (4) has been going on
for some time. All proposed solutions seem to have irreconcilable
downsides.

Cheers,
Jan.

Maybe you should set a config-time option (or create one) to avoid any
interaction with the shell?

Even better: If you don't want ever to become the victim of any exploit,
turn your computer off at the wall switch and leave it off.

That's what I thought, too. But vim\_strsave\_shellescape() is
documented to return NULL when out of memory:

src/misc2.c:

1279 \* Returns the result in allocated memory, NULL if we have run out.
 1280 \*/
 1281 char\_u \*
 1282 vim\_strsave\_shellescape(string, do\_special)

Yes, but... in the case of the line in question:
printf("ERROR: out of memory\n");
Jan wasn't trying to dynamically allocate more memory from the heap;
he was printing out a string that was already allocated by the OS
before vim even reached its main() function. In C, unlike in some
interpreted language like, IIRC, Python, all string literals are
loaded into memory before the program gets control, and any reference
to them is just a matter of dereferencing a pointer.

I haven't studied this example, but as I understand it, the suggestion is that I
could send you a file with a message like "What's the deal with this weird message
that Vim gives? Open file xxx and search for yyy then press K."

Jan is saying (I think) that following those instructions could execute malware.

Sure, it will never happen to me or you, but if we were discussing Microsoft Word,
most people would have no hesitation in declaring that such a vulnerability (press a
key in a document to get owned) is just NOT acceptable.

We aren't talking about mapping K to execute "system('dodgyfile')". K is performing
its default function, but that function could exploit you if executed on certain
text, with a certain file present.

If my understanding is correct, I don't think it's reasonable to write this off with
the "switch power off" joke (if I've got this wrong, please correct me).

Once again, thanks Jan!

John

Thanks for the feedback.

My understanding of how vim malloc() wrappers worked was incorrect.
I've updated the patch. These are the changes from the previous
version:

 }

Earlier in this function, the code does just return when out of
memory, so that's what I'll do as well. The realloc() return value
was not checked, so I fixed that as well. The updated patch (version
2) is attached.

Cheers,

Please! It's an editor. What kind of vulnerabilities would you
expect? You have to open a file, have a reasonable feature set
enabled, and do something. The real question is, why does the impact
always have to be arbitrary Ex/shell commands execution? And why are
there so many?

But it's a feature really: We all know it can take a long time for a
package maintainer to include a patch. Or perhaps, said package
maintainer thinks our patch sucks. Pperhaps he's even right! Not to
worry. With all these vulnerabilities, as long as they're is using
Vim, we can have all our patches included \_as soon as they view them\_.
 We can even have the packages built and uploaded at the same time!

Cheers,
Jan.

After applying this patch to Vim 7.2, I got following errors while

trying to use K command (and shell also freezes after getting the

couldn't find a reasonable one. And also, K command sometimes works as

I don't know if they're Vim-related or am I missing something, though.

I'd be happy if you can give me one or two clues.

This looks like you are visually selecting ``xml version="1.0" ?>'',
and pressing K. man says "No manual entry for <foo>", as it does,
then returns 16.

> Press ENTER or type command to continueVim: Caught deadly signal SEGV

Since the command has already been executed, this is past the function
that the patch affects, and therefore seems like an unrelated bug. A
backtrace would be nice.

Same as above. Why would anybody think there were a manual entry for
``appName = "Kaptan Wallpaper"'' is not clear to me...

If you can't reproduce the behaviour 100% of time, it's still better
to describe it. Otherwise, it's just guesswork.

Jan.

vim security update (RHSA-2008-0617)

Original Release Date: January 5, 2009

Last Revised: June 5, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-001

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Vim (Visual editor IMproved) is an updated and improved version of
the vi
editor.

Several input sanitization flaws were found in Vim's keyword and tag
handling. If Vim looked up a document's maliciously crafted tag or
keyword,
it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name [CVE-2008-4101](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4101) to this issue.

A heap-based overflow flaw was discovered in Vim's expansion of file
name
patterns with shell wildcards. An attacker could create a
specially-crafted
file or directory name that, when opened by Vim, caused the application
to
crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2008-3432](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3432) to this issue.

Several input sanitization flaws were found in various Vim system
functions. If a user opened a specially crafted file, it was possible to
execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name
[CVE-2008-2712](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2712) to this issue.

A format string flaw was discovered in
Vim's help tag processor. If a user was tricked into executing the
"helptags" command on malicious data, arbitrary code could be executed
with
the permissions of the user running Vim. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-2953](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2953) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0617.html>

Avaya has rated this as a Low risk level as either the package is
installed but not used by any application or exploitation would require
direct non-standard user interaction.

## 2. Avaya System Products with vim installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all vulnerable system products,
Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya

Subject: [oss-list] CVE request (vim)

Hello Steve,

  found relatively old issue in Vim, which was not covered
by the CVE-2008-2712 patch. Could you please assign a new
CVE id for it:

Report: <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-K.html>  [1]
Proposed patch: <http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/attach/dd32ad3a84f36bb2/K-arbitrary-command-execution.patch?part=2>
Other references: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=461927>

Affected versions: Successfully reproduced on vim-6.0-7.15 through vim-7.1.291-1.

Proof of concept: See part "4. EXPLOIT" from [1] report. The xclock
                  part is easily reproducible.

Impact: Arbitrary code execution.

Thank you in advance
Kind regards
Jan iankko Lieskovsky

the execute or system functions inside Vim scripts. If a user were tricked

into running Vim scripts with a specially crafted input, an attacker could

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2008-2712](/security/CVE-2008-2712))

Ben Schmidt discovered that Vim did not properly escape characters when

performing keyword or tag lookups. If a user were tricked into running specially

crafted commands, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-4101](/security/CVE-2008-4101))
