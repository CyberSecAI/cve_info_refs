```
- Root cause of vulnerability: When processing custom shortcut and menu commands, Opera can generate argument strings that contain uninitialized memory.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Uninitialized memory usage leading to potential information disclosure or code execution.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Potential arbitrary code execution.
    - Other unspecified attacks.
- Attack vectors: Malicious web pages can trick users into activating specially crafted custom shortcuts or menu commands.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Remote attacker can craft malicious web pages.
    - Requires user interaction to activate the malicious shortcut.
