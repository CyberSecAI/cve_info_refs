Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the insecure handling of cookies by Atomic Photo Album version 1.1.0pre4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application does not properly secure user login and password information within cookies. Specifically, it's vulnerable to cookie manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially bypass authentication by setting arbitrary values for login and password cookies.
- This allows unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out by manipulating client-side cookies using JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute Javascript in the victim's browser.
- No special network position is required for this client-side attack. The attacker only requires access to a vulnerable instance of the application.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit demonstrates how to set the `apa_cookie_login` and `apa_cookie_password` cookies to arbitrary values via Javascript:
```javascript
javascript:document.cookie = "apa_cookie_login=foo; path=/;";
javascript:document.cookie = "apa_cookie_password=bar; path=/;";
```
This suggests that the application relies solely on these cookies for authentication and does not validate or secure their content properly.
