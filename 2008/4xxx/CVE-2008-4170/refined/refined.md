Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4170:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `create_account.php` script of osCommerce 2.2rc2a. Specifically, the script does not properly validate the 'DOB' (Date of Birth) variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the format of the 'DOB' variable before passing it to the `checkdate()` function. It expects a date as a numerical value, but it accepts any input, which allows an attacker to trigger a PHP warning.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** While not directly leaking sensitive data, this issue allows an attacker to trigger PHP warning messages that could expose internal paths and potentially other sensitive information about the server configuration. 

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `create_account.php`, manipulating the `dob` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker can be remote and does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
-  **Low Complexity:** The attack is simple to execute and requires little effort on the part of the attacker.
