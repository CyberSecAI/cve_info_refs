    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-4917",
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities discovered in VMware Player, Server, and Workstation.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Privilege escalation",
        "Remote execution of arbitrary code",
         "Denial of Service"
         ],
      "impact": "Local users may gain escalated privileges, cause a Denial of Service, or gain sensitive information. A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file, resulting in remote code execution or a Denial of Service. Remote attackers may also be able to spoof DNS traffic, read arbitrary files, or inject arbitrary web script to the VMware Server Console. Guest OS users may be able to execute arbitrary code on the host OS, gain escalated privileges on the guest OS, or cause a Denial of Service (crash the host OS).",

        "Local access",
        "Remote via crafted file",
         "Spoofed DNS",
