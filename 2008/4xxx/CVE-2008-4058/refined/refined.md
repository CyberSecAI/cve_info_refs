Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises from the ability of page content to pollute `XPCNativeWrapper` objects. This pollution allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with chrome privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XPCNativeWrapper Pollution:** The core issue is that page content can manipulate `XPCNativeWrapper` objects, which are meant to be a secure way to access privileged JavaScript code. By polluting these wrappers, the intended security boundaries are bypassed.
*   **Chrome Privilege Escalation:** The manipulated `XPCNativeWrapper` can be used to elevate the privileges of the attacker's code, granting access to functionalities and data normally restricted to the browser's core components (chrome).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with chrome privileges. This is a severe impact, as chrome privileges mean the attacker has full access to the browser's internals and can potentially compromise the user's system.
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker could potentially use the escalated privileges to access sensitive user data managed by the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into visiting a malicious webpage. The crafted content on the page would then be able to pollute `XPCNativeWrapper` and escalate privileges.
*   **XSLT handling:** An attacker could also exploit the vulnerability through malformed XSLT documents.
*  `document.loadBindingDocument()`: The `document.loadBindingDocument()` can also be used to exploit this vulnerability because it returns a document that does not have a script handling object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server:** The attacker needs to host a malicious web page that contains the exploit.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the malicious webpage in order to trigger the exploit.
*   **JavaScript Enabled:** This vulnerability relies on the ability to execute javascript. It is noted that for Thunderbird, javascript is not enabled by default and users are strongly discouraged from enabling it.

**Additional Information from Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird.
*   The issue was reported by Mozilla security researcher `moz_bug_r_a4` and Mozilla developer `Olli Pettay`.
*   The fix involves upgrading to Firefox 2.0.0.17, Firefox 3.0.2, SeaMonkey 1.1.12, or Thunderbird 2.0.0.17.
*   A workaround is to disable JavaScript until a fix can be installed.
*   The fix for this issue is linked to the fix of [bug 441087](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=441087) on bugzilla.mozilla.org.
