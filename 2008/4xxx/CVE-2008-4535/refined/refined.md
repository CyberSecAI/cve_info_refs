{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in a user's web browser when they interact with the vulnerable application. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted input which is not properly sanitized by the EC-CUBE application. An attacker could inject malicious code via a vulnerable input field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious input and inject it into the web application. This can be done remotely."
