  "CVE-2008-4181": {
    "related_content": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `xml.php` file of the Fantastico application, where the `fantasticopath` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an `include` statement.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files on the server, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code if a specially crafted file is included. This could allow for complete compromise of the vulnerable server.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `xml.php` file. The request includes a `fantasticopath` parameter pointing to a local file that they want to include.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have access to the web interface of cPanel and be able to craft HTTP requests. They need to upload a malicious PHP file to a writable location, then use the LFI to include it."
