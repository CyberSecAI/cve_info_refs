  Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive data from the database, including admin usernames and password hashes.
  Attack vectors: The attack vector is through a crafted URL parameter (`id`) in the `news_read.php` script.
  Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `news_read.php` script and have some knowledge of SQL syntax to create the malicious injection.
