    *   **Severity:** HIGH.
    *   **Solution:** Update to version 1.7.1 (or 1.8.1 which is the most recent at the time of writing).
*   **Page Improvements (sm_pageimprovements):**
    *   **Affected Versions:** 1.1.0 and below.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    *   **Severity:** Medium.
    *   **Solution:** Update to version 0.2.0 (or 0.3.0 which is the most recent at the time of writing).

**Root Cause:**

The root cause for most of the vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input sanitization, leading to SQL Injection vulnerabilities. The Page Improvements extension has a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   SQL Injection in: `JobControl, Econda Plugin, Frontend Users View, Mannschaftsliste, M1 Intern, Simple survey`.
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in: `Page Improvements`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification of data, or complete compromise of the application's database.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector for SQL Injection is through the vulnerable parameters used by the extensions when building SQL queries.
*   The attack vector for XSS is through the injection of malicious scripts into vulnerable input fields of the affected extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For SQL Injection, the attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable extensions and inject malicious SQL code through their input parameters.
*   For XSS, the attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable input fields.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bulletin is a "Collective Security Bulletin (CSB)", which is a listing of less critical vulnerabilities, not affecting the core TYPO3 system or popular extensions.
*   The bulletin advises users to subscribe to the typo3-announce mailing list for future security updates.
*   The bulletin includes credit to the individuals who reported the vulnerabilities.
*   Some extensions with vulnerabilities have no fix available and users are instructed to remove them.
