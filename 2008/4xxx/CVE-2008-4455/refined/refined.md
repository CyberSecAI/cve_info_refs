Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4455

**Vulnerable Software:** MySQL Quick Admin <= 1.5.5

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application uses a cookie named "language" to determine which language file to include.
- It doesn't properly sanitize or validate the value of the "language" cookie before using it in an `include()` statement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This is possible because the application uses the unsanitized cookie value to construct a file path for inclusion.
- The code vulnerable is found in `/includes/required.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can read any file on the server's filesystem that the web server has permissions to access, potentially including configuration files, database credentials, or other sensitive information.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can obtain sensitive data from the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious "language" cookie. This cookie's value is then used in a vulnerable `include` statement to include a file outside of the intended scope.
- By sending a crafted HTTP request containing a malicious cookie to the server hosting the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability since it leverages a cookie.
- `magic_quotes_gpc` must be off.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the file system structure of the target server to exploit this vulnerability fully.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit code snippet provided shows how to set a crafted cookie with a path containing directory traversal sequences (`../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`) to read the content of `/etc/passwd`.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `required.php` file.

**Exploit Steps (as described in Exploit-DB):**
1.  Set a cookie named `language` with a malicious file path, like `../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`. The `%00` is a null byte which can be used to truncate the file path on some systems. The `path=/` is also important to apply the cookie to the whole site.
    ```javascript
    javascript:document.cookie="language=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00; path=/";
    ```
2.  Navigate to `/index.php` to trigger the vulnerable code.
