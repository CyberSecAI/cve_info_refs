```
Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of specially crafted file names by the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to how SMB handles file name length validation and file sharing.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: A buffer underflow vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol.

Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution. An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights. The attacker could gain complete control of an affected system.

Attack vectors: An attacker on a malicious client could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets to a server.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have the target host's IP address, NetBIOS computer name, and port number to send the malicious traffic. Authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability since the vulnerable function is reachable when the share type is a disk, which by default requires authentication. However, if the Guest account is enabled, then guest users can trigger this vulnerability as well.
