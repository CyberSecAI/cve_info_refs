{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly includes a file based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization. Specifically, the 'design' parameter from the GET request is used in a file inclusion statement.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include local files from the server's file system, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, application source code, or even execute arbitrary code if they can include a file that contains executable PHP code.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'design' parameter in a GET request, an attacker can specify an arbitrary file path, which is then included by the application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server. No specific authentication or privilege level is required."
