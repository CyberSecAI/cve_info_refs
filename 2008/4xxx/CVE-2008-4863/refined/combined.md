Subject: blender: Python scripts load modules from current directory
Date: Mon, 27 Oct 2008 00:37:12 -0400
```
Package: blender
Version: 2.46+dfsg-4
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole
Usertags: pythonpath

Blender's BPY_interface calls PySys_SetArgv such that Python prepends
sys.path with an empty string.  This allows the possibility to run
arbitrary code on the user's system if there is a python file in
Blender's working directory named the same as one that Blender's python
scripts try to import.

Subject: Python scripts load modules from current directory
Date: Wed, 12 Nov 2008 16:09:29 -0800
```
as intended, i guess, this patch breaks loading modules from the
current directory but i have scripts that need to load extra modules
from the current directory. how does one do it now? i've modified my
scripts to do

import sys
sys.path.append(".")

import Module

but this seems silly. shouldn't the current directory be appended to
the end of the system path so system modules are loaded first and then
if they don't exist they are loaded from the current directory?

You could also set PYTHONPATH, I guess? (Though untested, I only recall
having done so when hacking some pythonish stuff, having some modules
under lib/, so that scripts under bin/ could use them.)

That might be done, but I'm not very inclined to relax that sanity check
to allow “userscripts” again; I'm sorry, I kind of prefer having people
deliberately add “.” as you mentioned to having possible security holes
(not as obvious as previously, but I guess one could craft something).

Mraw,
KiBi.

i agree that having the current directory first in the path is a
security risk but having it after the system paths wouldn't it mean
that the system modules were loaded so there would be no security
risk?

```
```
As I discovered while discussing the Python path patch with Vim's
upstream[0], the patch I suggested to fix these bugs only works if the
libc follows SUS' definition[1] of how realpath(3) works.

Specifically, it must return NULL when given an empty string for the
path.  At least FreeBSD instead returns the current working directory of
the process[2], which means that removing the empty elements from
sys.path no longer has an effect.

When sending bug reports to your respective upstream, I'd suggest either
adjusting the patch to simply remove the first element of sys.path or
give a garbage path to PySys_SetArgv and explicitly filter that out of
sys.path (as was done by Vim's upstream[3]).

# Blender: Untrusted search path — GLSA **201001-07**

An untrusted search path vulnerability in Blender might result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/blender** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.48a-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.48a-r3** |

### Background

Blender is a 3D Creation/Animation/Publishing System.

### Description

Steffen Joeris reported that Blender's BPY\_interface calls
PySys\_SetArgv() in such a way that Python prepends sys.path with an
empty string.

### Impact

A local attacker could entice a user to run "blender" from a directory
containing a specially crafted Python module, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Blender users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/blender-2.48a-r3"
```
### References

* [CVE-2008-4863](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4863)

**Release date**

January 13, 2010

**Latest revision**

Subject: CVE id request: blender

Hi

There is a programming error in blender that can lead to arbitrary code
execution.

Description:
Blender's BPY_interface calls PySys_SetArgv such that Python prepends
sys.path with an empty string.  This allows the possibility to run
arbitrary code on the user's system if there is a python file in
Blender's working directory named the same as one that Blender's python
scripts try to import.

Debian Bug report:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=503632>

Could I please get a CVE id for this?

Cheers
Steffen
