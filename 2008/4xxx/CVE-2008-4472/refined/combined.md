# Autodesk DWF Viewer Control / LiveUpdate Module - Remote Code Execution

<!--
Autodesk DWF Viewer Control / LiveUpdate Module remote code execution exploit
by Nine:Situations:Group::bruiser
site: http://retrogod.altervista.org/
tested against IE6

tested software:  Revit Architecture 2009 sp2
                  Autodesk Design Review 2009 (which also comes with Revit)

dll settings (both):
RegKey Safe for Script: True
RegKey Safe for Init: True
Implements IObjectSafety: False
KillBitSet: False

The first vulnerability is caused due to the CExpressViewerControl class
(AdView.dll v9.0.0.96) which provide the insecure SaveAS() method
which allows to store locally files with arbitrary extension.
The second one is related to the ApplyPatch() one inside the UpdateEngine
class (LiveUpdate16.DLL, 17.2.56 ??... this is a shared one) which allows to launch an arbitrary
executable by the second argument. Note, that the first one, alone, allows
arbitrary code execution. The impact of the second one is limited if you cannot
specify command arguments or launch a file of yours.

The embedded dwf file (located at the url http://retrogod.altervista.org/suntzu.dwf)
has been created modifying an existing one, replacing a .png resource file with
a vbscript shell through the following script (note the PCLZIP_OPT_NO_COMPRESSION flag,
this has been used to preserve the code, note also the dwg files are
essentially zips) :

<?php
    //library:
    //http://www.phpconcept.net/pclzip/index.en.php#download
    include_once('pclzip.lib.php');

    $archive = new PclZip('suntzu.dwf');

    //modify path
    $list = $archive->add("com.autodesk.dwf.ePlot_CD186DAA4322089243B140AD3ACE11B7\\A84650EE-74A7-4766-8D0C-CC9EAE8313D3.png", PCLZIP_OPT_NO_COMPRESSION);

    if ($list == 0) {
      echo "ERROR : ".$archive->errorInfo(true);
    }
?>

take a look to suntzu.dwf with an hex-editor...
This exploit launch calc.exe but you can embed your own vbscript shell
and extended shell commands, by using the php code given.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Installation Instructions

### To Install Live Update Hotfix

You must have administrative privileges on your Microsoft® Windows® operating system to complete the installation process.

This installation requires you to replace the *liveupdate16.dll* file. After you replace this file, you must restart your system for this hotfix to take effect.

### To Replace the *LiveUpdate16.dll* File

1. Close all software applications.
2. Navigate to your Autodesk Shared folder; for example, *C:\Program Files\Common Files\Autodesk Shared.*
3. In the Autodesk Shared folder, right-click the *liveupdate16.dll* file and rename it *liveupdate16.bak*.
4. Extract the new  *liveUpdate16.dll* file to the Autodesk Shared folder.
