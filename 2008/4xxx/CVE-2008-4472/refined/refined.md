Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-4472:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two issues in Autodesk DWF Viewer Control and its LiveUpdate module:

1.  **Insecure `SaveAS()` method:** The `CExpressViewerControl` class (specifically `AdView.dll`) has an insecure `SaveAS()` method. This allows an attacker to save arbitrary files with attacker-controlled extensions to the local file system.
2.  **Insecure `ApplyPatch()` method:** The `UpdateEngine` class (specifically `LiveUpdate16.DLL`) contains an insecure `ApplyPatch()` method. This method can be used to launch an arbitrary executable file specified by the attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** The `SaveAS()` method allows writing files with any extension to the local file system. This can be abused to create malicious files (e.g., HTA files) in a location the attacker controls.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The `ApplyPatch()` method allows execution of arbitrary files. By using the file write vulnerability, an attacker can save a malicious file to the local system and then execute it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation leads to **remote code execution**, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves a user visiting a malicious webpage or opening a specially crafted DWF file through the Autodesk DWF viewer control.
*   The exploit leverages a combination of the file write and code execution vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious DWF file to the victim, either through a webpage, email, or other method.
*   The victim needs to have the vulnerable Autodesk DWF viewer control and live update module installed.
*   No special attacker privileges on the target system is required.
*   The attacker needs to be able to host the malicious DWF file on a server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code embeds a VBScript shell within a DWF file, which is then saved to the file system via the SaveAS() method and then executed by ApplyPatch(). This provides the attacker with code execution on the victim's system.
*   The exploit targets Internet Explorer, however, the underlying vulnerability exists within the Autodesk software regardless of the browser.
*   The vulnerability is present in AutoCAD 2004-2009 and related Autodesk products.
*   A hotfix is available to resolve this vulnerability that replaces the vulnerable  `liveupdate16.dll` file.
