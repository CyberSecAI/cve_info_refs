How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-075 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Windows Search Could Allow Remote Code Execution (959349)

Published: December 09, 2008 | Updated: December 10, 2008

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Windows Search. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens and saves a specially crafted saved-search file within Windows Explorer or if a user clicks a specially crafted search URL. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

The most severe vulnerability is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Windows Explorer frees memory when saving Windows Search files and by modifying the way that Windows Explorer interprets parameters when parsing the search-ms protocol. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

**Known Issues.** None

## Windows Saved Search Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4268

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when saving a specially crafted search file within Windows Explorer. This operation causes Windows Explorer to exit and restart in an exploitable manner.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4268).

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Saved Search Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4268

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open and save an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a specially crafted saved-search (.search-ms) file. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability require user interaction.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* Users running Internet Explorer 7 will be prompted by a dialog box indicating a web page is attempting to open content in Windows Explorer. This dialog box prompts the user to "Allow" or "Don't Allow" the content, but also allows users to not display messages of this type again. Users who have previously selected "Do not show me the warning for this program again" for Windows Explorer will not receive this prompt.

#### Workarounds for Windows Saved Search Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4268

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Temporarily change the file type associated with the â.search-msâ file extension. Enter the following command at an elevated command prompt:

  assoc .search-ms=xmlfile

  **Impact of workaround.** Saved-search files will open as XML files in Internet Explorer.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Enter the following command at an elevated command prompt:

  assoc .search-ms=SearchFolder
* Modify the registry to deny users the ability to open saved-search files or to access the saved search folder.

  To modify the registry key, follow these steps:

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then expand the following registry subkey:

     HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\SearchFolder

     Click **Edit**, and then click **Permissions**

     **Note** Make a note of the permissions that are listed in this dialog box so that you can restore them to their original values at a later time.
  3. Click **Advanced.**
  4. Click to clear the **Include inheritable permissions from this object's parent** check box. You are prompted to click **Copy**, **Remove**, or **Cancel**. Click **Remove**, and then click **OK.**
  5. You receive a message that states that no one will be able to access this registry key. Click **Yes**, and then click **OK** to close the **Permissions for SearchFolder** dialog box.

  **Impact of workaround.** Users will be unable to open saved search files or access the saved search folder.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Restore the previously configured permissions on the registry key by clicking to check **Include inheritable permissions from this object's parent** and then clicking **OK** two times.
* Unregister the SearchFolder file type.

  To modify the registry key, follow these steps:

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system.

#### FAQ for Windows Saved Search Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4268

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Windows Explorer does not correctly free memory when saving Windows Search files.

**What is Windows Search?**

Windows Search is a standard component of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 that is enabled by default. Windows Search allows instant search capabilities for most common file and data types such as e-mail, contacts, calendar appointments, documents, photos, multimedia, and other formats extended by third parties. These capabilities enable consumers and information workers to more efficiently find, manage, and organize the increasing amount of data common in home and enterprise environments. For more information, see the [Windows Search home page](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/desktopsearch/default.mspx).

**Is the Windows Search component available for Windows XP affected by this issue?**

No. Although Windows Search is as optional add-in for Windows XP, it is not affected by this issue.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code on a userâs system. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open and save a specially crafted saved-search file with an affected version of Windows Explorer.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted saved-search file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file. After opening the file, the user would have to save the saved-search file in order for exploit to occur. The exploit occurs regardless of where the search is saved.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a saved-search file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. The attacker would then have to convince the user to open and save a specially crafted search files. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Windows Explorer frees memory when saving Windows Search files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. This security bulletin addresses the privately disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Windows Search Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4269

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Explorer that allows an attacker to construct a malicious web page that includes a call to the search-ms protocol handler. The protocol handler in turn passes untrusted data to Windows Explorer.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-4269](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4269).

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Search Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4269

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a specially crafted Windows Search (search-ms://) URL. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability require user interaction.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* Customers who are running Internet Explorer 7 with default settings will receive a pop-up warning asking users if they want to allow the web page to communicate with Windows Explorer. The default setting is to not allow the communication.
* Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 systems will display a warning dialog before executing a program from outside of the intranet. This warning will not be displayed if the attacker tries to reference and executable within the intranet or on the targetâs machine.

#### Workarounds for Windows Search Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4269

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable search-ms protocol handler within Windows Explorer**

  **Note** Repairing Office or installing an Office security update may undo this workaround.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.
