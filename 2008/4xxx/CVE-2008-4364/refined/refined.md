Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4364

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the ParsaWeb CMS. Specifically, the "id" parameter in `default.aspx` and the `txtSearch` parameter in the search section are not properly validated or escaped before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which arises due to the lack of proper input sanitization before passing it to SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Full Control:** In severe cases, attackers might be able to gain full control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** Exploiting the "id" parameter in `default.aspx` using specially crafted URLs.
- **HTTP GET Requests:** Exploiting the `txtSearch` parameter in the search section using malicious search queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the web application.
- **Basic knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques.
- **No authentication:** No prior authentication to the application is required.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable parameters: "id" parameter in default.aspx and txtSearch in the search section.
- Example exploit for the "id" parameter: `http://www.example.com/?page=page&id=-164 or 1=(select top 1 user_pass from tblUsers where user_name = 'admin')`
- Example exploit for the search parameter: `http://www.example.com/?page=Search Search:AmnPardaz%') union ALL select '1',user_name+':'+user_pass,'3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10',11 from tblUsers--`
- The vulnerability exists in the handling of the parameters before using them in SQL queries.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as a medium risk with a CVSS base score of 7.5/10.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, with a low attack complexity.
- This is an SQL injection vulnerability classified as CWE-89.
