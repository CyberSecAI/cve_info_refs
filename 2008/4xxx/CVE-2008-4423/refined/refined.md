Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4423:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in Ovidentia version 6.6.5.
*   **Weakness:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input when handling the `item` parameter in the `index.php` script, specifically within the contact module.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `item` parameter, an attacker can manipulate database queries.
*   **Impact:** A successful SQL injection allows an attacker to:
    *   Extract sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords, from the database.
    *   Potentially modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the application or its underlying system.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   The attacker needs to be logged in as a simple user to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The specific vulnerable URL is identified as `http://Site/index.php?tg=contact&idx=modify&item=-99999'+union+select+0,1,2,concat(0x6E69636B6E616D65,0x3A,nickname),concat(0x70617373776F7264,0x3A,password),5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14+from+bab_users/*`. This crafted URL demonstrates the SQL injection payload.
*   The provided payload uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `bab_users` table, specifically the `nickname` and `password` columns.
*   The exploit requires prior login as a simple user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by IRCRASH (R3d.W0rm).
*   The exploit is publicly available on exploit-db.com.
*   The advisory mentions another similar CVE, CVE-2008-3918, which might be related.
