{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vdrleaktest script in the media-video/vdr package was creating a temporary log file in /tmp/ without using proper protections against symlink attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary file creation",
      "Symlink vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could create a symlink to a sensitive file in /tmp/, causing the vdrleaktest script to overwrite or corrupt that file when it creates the log file in the same path, potentially leading to data loss or privilege escalation",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local user privileges on the system."

  "cve_metadata": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2008-4985",
    "description": "The vdrleaktest script in media-video/vdr creates a log file in /tmp without using proper protections against symlink attacks, allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary files.",
     "additional_information": "The Gentoo bug report and Debian bug report provide more context. The vulnerability was present in the debian specific vdrleaktest script and not in the upstream media-video/vdr-1.4.7-r10 or media-video/vdr-1.6.0_p2."
