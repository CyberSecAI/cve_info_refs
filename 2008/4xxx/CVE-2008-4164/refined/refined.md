    "ID": "CVE-2008-4164",
    "content": "The provided content details a vulnerability in MemHT Portal <= 3.9.0, specifically a SQL injection vulnerability in the /inc/inc_statistics.php script.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the script's failure to sanitize user-supplied data from the `$_COOKIE['stats_res']` variable before using it in a SQL query. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw.\n- Unfiltered input: The script directly uses the unsanitized `$_COOKIE['stats_res']` value in a SQL query.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Remote code execution: An attacker can leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to write a malicious PHP shell to the server's file system. This grants the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- HTTP request: The attack vector is through crafting a malicious HTTP request with a specially crafted `stats_res` cookie.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Remote network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.\n- `magic_quotes_gpc` needs to be disabled on the server.\n- MySQL user needs to have file write permissions.\n- Knowledge of the full server path (or ability to brute-force it) is needed to write the shell to a accessible location.",
