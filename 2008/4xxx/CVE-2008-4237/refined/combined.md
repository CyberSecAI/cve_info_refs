### Overview

Apple has released Security Update [2008-008](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT3338) and Mac OS X version 10.5.6 to correct multiple vulnerabilities affecting Apple Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code, gain access to sensitive information, or cause a denial of service.

Apple Security Update [2008-008](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT3338) and Apple Mac OS X version 10.5.6 address a number of vulnerabilities affecting Apple Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server versions prior to and including 10.4.11 and 10.5.5. The update also addresses vulnerabilities in other vendors' products that ship with Apple Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server.

### Impact

The impacts of these vulnerabilities vary. Potential consequences include arbitrary code execution, sensitive information disclosure, denial of service, or privilege escalation.

### Solution

Install Apple Security Update [2008-008](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT3338) or Apple Mac OS X version 10.5.6. These and other updates are available via [Software Update](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1338?viewlocale=en_US) or via [Apple Downloads](https://support.apple.com/downloads/).

Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
