  "CVE-2008-4321": {
    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FlashGet 1.9.0.1012 when processing the FTP PWD response. Sending a specially crafted response can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the handling of the FTP PWD response within FlashGet 1.9.0.1012. When the application receives the server response to the PWD command, it copies the data into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking, allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory on the stack.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Lack of proper bounds checking when copying data"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution. This could result in complete compromise of the affected system, including the ability to execute malicious code, install malware, steal sensitive information, or gain full control over the victim's machine.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote, exploiting the FTP protocol. An attacker needs to set up a malicious FTP server that sends a specially crafted oversized string as a response to the PWD command. The victim would then need to attempt to download a file from this malicious server using FlashGet.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to set up a malicious FTP server and have a victim initiate a file download using FlashGet from this malicious FTP server."
