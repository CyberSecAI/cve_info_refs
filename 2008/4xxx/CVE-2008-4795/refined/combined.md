# Opera: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200811-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Opera, allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/opera** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.62** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.62** |

### Background

Opera is a fast web browser that is available free of charge.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Opera:

* Opera does not restrict the ability of a framed web page to change
  the address associated with a different frame (CVE-2008-4195).
* Chris Weber (Casaba Security) discovered a Cross-site scripting
  vulnerability (CVE-2008-4196).
* Michael A. Puls II discovered
  that Opera can produce argument strings that contain uninitialized
  memory, when processing custom shortcut and menu commands
  (CVE-2008-4197).
* Lars Kleinschmidt discovered that Opera, when
  rendering an HTTP page that has loaded an HTTPS page into a frame,
  displays a padlock icon and offers a security information dialog
  reporting a secure connection (CVE-2008-4198).
* Opera does not
  prevent use of links from web pages to feed source files on the local
  disk (CVE-2008-4199).
* Opera does not ensure that the address
  field of a news feed represents the feed's actual URL
  (CVE-2008-4200).
* Opera does not check the CRL override upon
  encountering a certificate that lacks a CRL (CVE-2008-4292).
* Chris (Matasano Security) reported that Opera may crash if it is
  redirected by a malicious page to a specially crafted address
  (CVE-2008-4694).
* Nate McFeters reported that Opera runs Java
  applets in the context of the local machine, if that applet has been
  cached and a page can predict the cache path for that applet and load
  it from the cache (CVE-2008-4695).
* Roberto Suggi Liverani
  (Security-Assessment.com) reported that Opera's History Search results
  does not escape certain constructs correctly, allowing for the
  injection of scripts into the page (CVE-2008-4696).
* David
  Bloom reported that Opera's Fast Forward feature incorrectly executes
  scripts from a page held in a frame in the outermost page instead of
  the page the JavaScript URL was located (CVE-2008-4697).
* David
  Bloom reported that Opera does not block some scripts when previewing a
  news feed (CVE-2008-4698).
* Opera does not correctly sanitize
  content when certain parameters are passed to Opera's History Search,
  allowing scripts to be injected into the History Search results page
  (CVE-2008-4794).
* Opera's links panel incorrectly causes
  scripts from a page held in a frame to be executed in the outermost
  page instead of the page where the URL was located
  (CVE-2008-4795).

### Impact

These vulnerabilties allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code,
to run scripts injected into Opera's History Search with elevated
privileges, to inject arbitrary web script or HTML into web pages, to
manipulate the address bar, to change Opera's preferences, to determine
the validity of local filenames, to read cache files, browsing history,
and subscribed feeds or to conduct other attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-9.62"
```

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

provided that the advisory is not modified in any way. In particular, the
clear text signature should show proof of the authenticity of the text.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
