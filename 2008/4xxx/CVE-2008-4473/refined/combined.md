How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

========================================================================
Multiple Flash Authoring Heap Overflows - Malformed SWF Files
Vendor Website: http://www.adobe.com
Affected Versions:
Adobe Flash Professional CS3/Flash MX2004
Vendor Notified. July 2008
Public Disclosure. October 16th 2008
Researcher: Paul Craig - paul.craig <at> security-assessment.com
http://www.security-assessment.com/files/advisories/2008-10-16\_Multiple\_Flash\_Authoring\_Heap\_Overflows.pdf
http://www.adobe.com/go/apsa08-09
========================================================================
============================ Overview ==================================
During analysis of the SWF file format used by commercial Flash authoring
applications multiple heap overflows were discovered within Adobe Flash
CS3 Professional, and Adobe Flash MX 2004.
Heap overflow conditions occurred when opening or importing malformed .SWF
files within the Flash authoring applications.
Exploitable conditions were related to excessively long control parameters
within an SWF file, which resulted in a heap overflow condition.
Exploitation of the heap overflow conditions would allow a malicious user
to gain command execution on the system which opened the file.
Only the Flash authoring software was found to insecurely parse malformed
.SWF files.
The Flash player was NOT found to be vulnerable to these specific attacks.
=========================== Solutions ==================================
A patch has been released from Adobe to address this vulnerability within CS3.
Additionally Adobe Flash CS4 has been officially released which resolves
these particular vulnerabilities.
