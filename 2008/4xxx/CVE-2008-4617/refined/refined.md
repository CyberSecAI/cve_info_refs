Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Joomla! Component "actualite" version 1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the `id` parameter within the `index.php` file is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Database compromise:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., usernames and password hashes stored in `jos_users`).
*   **Potential full system compromise:** While not explicitly stated, this vulnerability, if chained with other flaws, could lead to further compromise such as privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL. The attack vector is through web requests.
*   **Specifically:** `index.php?option=com_actualite&task=edit&id=[SQL Injection payload]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
*   **No authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided exploit string uses a `UNION SELECT` to extract user credentials from the database: `index.php?option=com_actualite&task=edit&id=-1%20union%20select%201,concat(username,char(32),password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9%20from%20jos_users/*`
*   The component's description indicates that it's for managing news for the "CAF" (Caisse d'Allocations Familiales, or Family Allowance Fund, a French welfare organization).
*   The `dork`  `allinurl: "com_actualite"` can be used to find vulnerable websites.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5, with high exploitability (10/10).
