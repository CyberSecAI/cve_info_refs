Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4590:

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected Software:** Stash 1.0.3
*   **Root Cause:** The exploit uses SQL injection in `admin/login.php` to bypass login authentication. A second SQL injection in `admin/news.php` is then used to extract user information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of user credentials (usernames, MD5-hashed passwords, email addresses, and admin status).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to know the path to the Stash installation directory, the admin username, and the database table prefix.
*   **Exploit Details:** The provided Perl script (`stash103exp.pl`) automates the exploitation process.
    1.  It first authenticates using an SQL injection in the username field of the `admin/login.php` script.
    2.  After successful authentication, it injects another SQL query into the `admin/news.php` script via the `post` parameter to extract user information from the database.

The SQL injection in `admin/login.php` uses the following payload:
`' OR user_username = '$username`
The SQL injection in `admin/news.php` uses a UNION SELECT statement to extract user data:
```sql
-1 UNION SELECT 1 AS news_id, 'Injection' AS news_title,
CONCAT('<1>',user_id,':',user_username,':',user_password,':',user_key,
':',user_firstname,' ', user_lastname,':', user_email,':', user_admin,
'<2>') AS news_body, 'Mitnick' AS news_author, NOW() AS news_date, 0
AS news_comment FROM ".$prefix."news, ".$prefix."user"
```
This query extracts user IDs, usernames, passwords, keys, full names, email addresses, and admin status. The passwords are MD5-hashed.
