Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4492:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `usNick` cookie when processed by the `referrals.php` script in Yourownbux v4.0. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (Blind):** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. Because the injection point is within a cookie value, the attacker cannot directly see the results of their injected SQL queries. They must infer results based on server responses and can extract data character by character. This is referred to as "blind" SQL injection because the direct output of the query is not visible.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `usNick` cookie's content before using it in an SQL query, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials (usernames and passwords). This is possible using the blind SQL injection technique to extract information bit by bit.
- **Authentication Bypass:**  By extracting user credentials or manipulating the user's session, an attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `usNick` cookie value using Javascript. An attacker can craft a malicious cookie containing SQL injection payloads. The modified cookie is then sent to the server along with the HTTP request for `referrals.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Logged-in User:** The attacker must be logged into the Yourownbux application, as the vulnerability is triggered on the `referrals.php` page.
- **Ability to Manipulate Cookies:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate or inject the `usNick` cookie, which can be done through client-side Javascript.
- **Understanding of SQL:**  An understanding of SQL is required to craft effective injection payloads. Specifically, knowledge of techniques for blind SQL injection is needed to extract data.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**

* **Blind SQL injection:** The exploit requires using blind SQL injection techniques to extract data, due to the injection point being within a cookie.
* **Specific Injection Point:** The vulnerable code exists within the `referrals.php` script and is triggered by the value of the `usNick` cookie.
* **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided content includes a proof of concept using Javascript to set a malicious cookie and an example SQL injection payload.
* **Exploit Availability:** The information mentions that a full exploit for the vulnerability would be available on DropSec.com at a later date (next week of the publication date).
* **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS Base Score of 7.5/10 which indicates a high risk and the Exploitability Subscore is 10/10, meaning it's easy to exploit.
