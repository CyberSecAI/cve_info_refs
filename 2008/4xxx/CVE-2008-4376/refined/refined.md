Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4376

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `index.php` script of the "live-tv-script" application. Specifically, the `mid` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. Input from the `mid` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially access, modify, or delete data from the application's database.
- **Information Disclosure:** The provided exploit aims to retrieve the `uid` and `pwd` (likely username and password) from the `admin` table, indicating sensitive information can be exposed.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the compromised account has sufficient privileges, the attacker could gain administrative control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed via an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `mid` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Understanding of SQL:**  The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax to craft the malicious injection. The provided exploit demonstrates one such crafted injection.

**Exploit Example:**
The provided exploit shows an example of injecting SQL code via the `mid` parameter:

```
www.site.me/patch/index.php?mid=-99999+union+select+0,unhex(hex(concat(uid,0x3a,pwd))),0,0+from+admin/*
```

This exploits the vulnerability by appending a SQL `UNION` statement to the original query, attempting to retrieve the `uid` and `pwd` from the `admin` table.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerable script is identified as `live-tv-script`, specifically from `www.livetvscript.com`.
- The exploit was reported by "InjEctOr5".
- The exploit was published on `2008-09-09`.
- The language is PHP.
