  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-4781",
      "root_cause": "The application includes a file based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially leading to information disclosure, code execution, or other malicious activities.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the 'langage' GET parameter in the 'update.php' file.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the update.php file where the 'langage' parameter from the GET request is used to construct a file path.  The application attempts to include the file located at `lang/$langue.php` where `$langue` is the value provided in the GET parameter. The use of  `%00` (null byte) in the URL allows bypassing any potential filename checking to include other arbitrary files."
