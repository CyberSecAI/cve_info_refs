Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4230:

**CVE-2008-4230**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to an issue in how SMS messages are displayed when the emergency call screen is visible. Specifically, even if the "Show SMS Preview" preference is set to "OFF", the entire content of an incoming SMS message is displayed if the message arrives while the emergency call screen is active.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The weakness is a violation of the intended behavior of the "Show SMS Preview" setting. The system fails to respect the user's privacy preference when the emergency call screen is active.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact is the potential exposure of sensitive information contained in SMS messages to unauthorized individuals who have access to the device while the emergency call screen is displayed. This could allow anyone with physical access to see the content of messages which were intended to be private.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves receiving an SMS message while the emergency call screen is active. This requires only that an SMS be sent to the device while it is showing the emergency dialler.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires physical access to the device while it is showing the emergency dial screen. No other technical knowledge or capabilities are required. The attacker does not need to unlock the device, or possess any form of credentials.
