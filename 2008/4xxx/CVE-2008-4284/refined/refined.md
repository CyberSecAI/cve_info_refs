Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in APAR PK71126, which seems to be related to a lack of control over the redirection destination after logout:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue is that the destination URL for the logout exit page is not restricted. This means that after a user logs out, the application might redirect them to an arbitrary URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Redirection:** The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to validate or restrict the URL used for redirection after logout. This allows for potential manipulation of the redirect target.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** An attacker could manipulate the redirection target to lead users to a malicious website that mimics the legitimate login page or another sensitive application. This allows the attacker to steal user credentials or other sensitive information.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Although not directly stated, uncontrolled redirection could be chained with other vulnerabilities (like open redirects) to perform XSS. If an attacker can influence the redirection URL with malicious scripts, the victim's browser could execute it.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Potentially, the redirect could reveal sensitive information about the application or the user, depending on the target URL an attacker could use.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker could redirect users to a URL that could cause issues for the user's browser or system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulation of Logout Request:** Attackers can likely manipulate the logout process, potentially by crafting malicious URLs or requests that alter the intended logout redirect destination.
*   **Session Hijacking (Indirect):**  While not direct, redirecting the victim to a malicious page might lead to session hijacking if the malicious page is designed to steal the user's session details after a successful (phished) login.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application. This usually requires access to the network where the web application is located.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable logout mechanism and how to influence the redirection target.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided document references multiple versions of WebSphere Application Server affected by this vulnerability (5.0.2.18, 5.1.1.19, 6.0.2.29, 6.1.0.19, 6.1.0.21).
*   The fix (APAR PK71126) focuses on limiting the redirection target, suggesting that the solution involves adding validation or restrictions to the logout redirect URL.
*   The technical details are limited to identifying the symptom (unrestricted redirection) and suggesting that the fix is focused on limiting that redirection, without explaining the details on how the exploit can be achieved.
