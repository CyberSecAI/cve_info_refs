{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The script `/inc/inc_statistics.php` accepts unfiltered `$_COOKIE['stats_res']` values, which are then used in a MySQL query.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to the creation of a malicious PHP shell on the server, allowing for remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "HTTP POST request with a crafted `stats_res` cookie.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the server. The target server needs to have `magic_quotes_gpc` off and MySQL must have file write permissions. The attacker also needs to know the full server path to the portal."
