Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the "Web Filter" component of Blue Coat products.
*   The root cause is insufficient input sanitization, specifically, a failure to properly handle user-supplied URLs, allowing for the injection of malicious script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The system fails to sanitize or encode user-supplied data within a URL, allowing for arbitrary JavaScript execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Antivirus Scans:** The vulnerability allows attackers to potentially bypass antivirus scans by injecting malicious code into the URL.
*   **Spoofing:** Attackers can use XSS to spoof content, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting JavaScript code, attackers can execute malicious actions in the context of the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code, as demonstrated in the provided Proof of Concept (POC):
    `http://www.example.com/file.exe?<script>(1)</script>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into accessing it through a vulnerable Blue Coat web filter. This could be done via:
    *   Email containing a link to the malicious URL.
    *   A malicious website with a link to the malicious URL.
    *   Social engineering tactics.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was initially reported as affecting only Internet Explorer, but that was potentially a misunderstanding/limitation of initial testing, not necessarily indicating it was limited to that browser.
*   Blue Coat Systems issued a security advisory to address this issue, details of which can be found at the link: `<http://www.bluecoat.com/support/securityadvisories/icap_patience>`.
