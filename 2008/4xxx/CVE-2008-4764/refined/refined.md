Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Local Directory Traversal issue. It arises because the `com_extplorer` component in Joomla does not properly sanitize the `dir` parameter in the `show_error` action. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to provide directory traversal sequences like `../` to access files and directories outside of the intended webroot.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to traverse directories by manipulating the `dir` parameter.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The component fails to validate and sanitize the user-supplied `dir` parameter, leading to the traversal issue.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server that the web server user has access to. The provided example shows accessing `/etc` and `/var/named` which could lead to significant security breaches.
    *   **Potential for Further Attacks:** This type of vulnerability can sometimes be chained with other vulnerabilities to gain more access to the server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the Joomla site.
    *   **`dir` Parameter Modification:** The specific attack vector involves modifying the `dir` parameter in the URL with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..%2F..%2F..%2F`).

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Joomla application.
    *   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Component:** The attacker needs to know that the `com_extplorer` component is installed and vulnerable and how to craft the exploit URL.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable URL is of the format: `target.com/path/index.php?option=com_extplorer&action=show_error&dir=../../[directory]`
*   The exploit uses URL-encoded forward slashes (`%2F`) in the `dir` parameter to bypass basic filtering attempts.
*   The vulnerable component versions are `<= 2.0.0 RC2`.
