      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection of users to malicious sites. The injected script can execute in the context of the user's browser, potentially granting the attacker access to sensitive information or actions within the application.",

     "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the vulnerable variables, most likely through crafting a URL or manipulating form data."
