RELATED: CVE-2008-4925
  Root cause of vulnerability: The ActiveX control 'Datamatrix.dll', specifically version 3.0.0.1, contains insecure methods 'SaveAsBMP' and 'SaveAsWMF' that can be called with arbitrary file paths.

  Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure method, Arbitrary file creation.

  Impact of exploitation: An attacker can create arbitrary files on the victim's system by calling the vulnerable methods with an attacker-controlled file path. This can potentially overwrite existing system files or create malicious ones.

  Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by crafting a malicious HTML page that exploits the ActiveX control using VBScript.

  Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to lure a victim to visit a specially crafted HTML page containing malicious VBScript code. The victim must have the vulnerable ActiveX control installed and enabled in their browser.
