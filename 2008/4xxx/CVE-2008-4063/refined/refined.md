The root cause is within layout/javascript engines which leads to crashes. Attackers can exploit this by tricking users into opening malicious websites with JavaScript enabled, potentially leading to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution with the user's privileges. The vulnerability exists in both Firefox and Thunderbird."
