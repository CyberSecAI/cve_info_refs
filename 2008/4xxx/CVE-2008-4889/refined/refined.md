Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the provided content, specifically from the exploit-db.com content:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4889

**Vulnerable Software:** DZCP (deV!L`z Clanportal) version 1.4.9.6

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Blind SQL Injection

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application is vulnerable to Blind SQL injection. This means an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into a vulnerable parameter, even though the results of the query are not directly displayed. The attacker uses a conditional query and observes the server's response to infer information about the database.
- The specific vulnerability lies within the "users" parameter when adding a buddy, which can be manipulated to perform SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, such as user passwords. The exploit code provided demonstrates how to extract the password hash of the first user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests are used to send the malicious SQL injection payloads to the server.
- The vulnerable parameter is within the user/index.php?action=buddys&do=addbuddy URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a registered user of the DZCP application and authenticated with valid credentials.
- The attacker needs to know the server URL, path to the DZCP installation, a valid username, and password for the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests.

**Exploit Details:**
- The provided exploit code is a Perl script that automates the SQL injection process.
- It first logs into the application. It handles CAPTCHA, if required.
- It then crafts a series of SQL injection payloads using a binary search technique to extract the characters of the password hash, one by one.
- The SQL injection uses the `substring()` function in combination with a comparison operator (= or >) and the hex value of the character being tested.
- The script uses the `if` statement in the SQL query to test if the current character of the password hash is equal to or greater than the value being tested. Depending on the result of the query, the server responds differently allowing the attacker to infer the correct character.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit code targets extracting the password of the first user in the `dzcp_users` table.
- The exploit code includes an array function with the hex values of numbers and characters that can be used to brute force the password.
- The exploit requires a valid username/password to be used on the target site and a valid path to the vulnerable application.

This information provides a detailed understanding of the vulnerability, how it can be exploited, and its potential impact. The provided exploit code offers a practical demonstration of the attack technique.
