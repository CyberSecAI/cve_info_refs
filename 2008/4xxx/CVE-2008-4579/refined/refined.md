{
  "cve": "CVE-2008-4579",
  "description": "The (1) fence_apc and (2) fence_apc_snmp programs, as used in (a) fence 2.02.00-r1 and possibly (b) cman, when running in verbose mode, allows local users to append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the apclog temporary file.",
  "affected_packages": [
    "fence",
    "cman",
     "redhat-cluster",
    "redhat-cluster-suite"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insecure temporary file handling in fence_apc and fence_apc_snmp when run in verbose mode.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The programs create a temporary file `/tmp/apclog` to log output.",
       "They do not properly handle symlinks, allowing a local user to create a symlink to a different file instead of the temporary file.",
      "The programs append output to the log file, allowing for arbitrary file appending via symlink manipulation."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files by creating a symlink to that file, causing the logging output to be appended to that file.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access.",
      "required_capabilities": "Local user access to the system is required to exploit this vulnerability, specifically to run the fence_apc or fence_apc_snmp programs in verbose mode and create symlinks.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is triggered when the programs are run in verbose mode. The issue also affects the `fence_manual` and `fence_ack_manual` programs due to insecure handling of a FIFO socket in `/tmp`."
