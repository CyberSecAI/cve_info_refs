Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4524

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection in AdaptCMS Lite version 1.3 and earlier.
- The vulnerability occurs in the `check_user.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not directly output the results of the SQL query, making it necessary to infer the output by observing the application's behavior based on true/false conditions in the SQL query.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the `user_name` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as user passwords.
- **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the application's data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `check_user.php` script.
- **`user_name` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `user_name`, where the attacker injects SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the user ID of a user in the database to extract their password hash.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to use a blind SQL injection to extract the password hash of a specific user, character by character, by making a series of requests.
- The exploit script uses the following SQL injection payload as an example:
  `' or ascii(substring((select password from adaptcms_users where id=$uid),$sub,1))=$set#`
  - `$uid` is the user ID being targeted.
  - `$sub` is the position of character in the password hash being extracted.
  - `$set` iterates through numbers and characters to determine the ASCII value of the character.

This exploit leverages the fact that if the query evaluates to true, the application will respond with "yes", otherwise no, which is then used to construct the password hash.
