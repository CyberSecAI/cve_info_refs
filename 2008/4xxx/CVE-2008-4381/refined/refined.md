Subject: regarding CVE-2008-4382 & CVE-2008-4381

Hi,
I just had a look at CVE-2008-4382 which is the same issue
as CVE-2008-4381 but just for conqueror should not get its
own CVE id in my opinion.

We at Debian don't handle browser
issues like this as security issues anyway but in this case
looking at the PoC this would work in every browser
supporting JavaScript as this is just a trivial memory
consumption issue by passing a very large string too the
alert function and thus eating memory, a simple
while(true){} would be equally effective for eating cpu
cycles which I wouldn't consider as a vulnerability
either...

I verified this at least with firefox and opera.

Cheers
Nico

- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A large string is passed to the `alert` function using javascript, leading to excessive memory consumption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the excessive memory consumption caused by a large string when passed to the `alert` function in a JavaScript context. This can lead to a denial-of-service.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The primary impact is a denial-of-service, where the browser becomes unresponsive due to excessive memory consumption.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through a crafted JavaScript code that creates a large string and then passes it to the alert function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to inject or have a user execute the malicious javascript code.

I usually wouldn't call it a vulnerability, either.  However, based on our
analysis, the String.fromCharCode(550) creates a Unicode string for
character 550, but the escape() for URL encoding can only cover 0 to 255,
so it seemed like something else was going on here, maybe the alert
function not working.

I don't know how Javascript manages large strings, but it seems like
somewhere around the "x4 += x4;" statement, you exceed multiple gigs.  So
maybe the alert function isn't even being reached...

-   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is rooted in the way JavaScript handles very large strings, especially during manipulations like string concatenation (x4 += x4) and when passed to functions like alert().  The `String.fromCharCode(550)` creates a Unicode character, while the `escape()` function only encodes characters up to 255, potentially leading to an issue with the alert function's behavior when processing.
-   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The JavaScript engine's management of very large strings, especially when combined with Unicode and URL encoding, leads to excessive memory consumption. It is also suggested that the `alert` function might not be reached because of memory exhaustion.
-   **Impact of exploitation:** The primary impact is denial-of-service, where the browser becomes unresponsive due to the very large string exceeding memory limits.
-   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted JavaScript code that rapidly increases string size, leveraging a potentially inefficient string-handling mechanism in the browser.
-  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the malicious javascript code within the scope of the browser.
