Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL Injection in the `pollID` parameter of `pollBooth.php`. The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input before using it in a SQL query.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can:
    *   Retrieve sensitive data from the database, including user credentials such as passwords, as demonstrated in the provided exploit.
    *   Potentially modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain further access depending on the permissions of the database user used by the application.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `pollBooth.php`, specifically by manipulating the `pollID` parameter.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific prior access to the system is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit `pollBooth.php?op=results&pollID=-1+union+select+password,1,2,3+from+users` shows how an attacker can inject a SQL `UNION` statement to extract user passwords from the `users` table.
*   The exploit is specific to Pollbooth v2.0.
*   The exploit was published on 2008-04-13.
*   The exploit was published by a user named S@BUN.
