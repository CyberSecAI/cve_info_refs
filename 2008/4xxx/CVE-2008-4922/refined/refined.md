```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the `ImageURL` property of the DjVu ActiveX Control 3.0.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Buffer Overflow: The `ImageURL` property does not properly validate the length of the input, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer.
- Unsafe SEH: The application does not use Safe Structured Exception Handling, making it easier to overwrite the SEH handler.
- Heap Spray: The exploit leverages heap spraying to increase the chances of landing the shellcode at a predictable memory location.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine, leading to complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Attack vectors:
- Remote: By crafting a malicious web page or document that loads the vulnerable DjVu ActiveX control, an attacker can trigger the overflow when a victim opens the page/document.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs the ability to host a web page or distribute a malicious document with a specially crafted exploit for the vulnerable DjVu ActiveX control.
- The victim needs to have the vulnerable DjVu ActiveX Control 3.0 installed.
- No authentication is needed.

Additional details:
- The exploit utilizes a combination of SEH overwrite and heap spraying techniques to bypass security measures.
- Other properties like 'Mode', 'Page', and 'Zoom' may also be vulnerable.
