Subject: viewvc security flaw?

I'm not sure about this one, I'm wondering if someone else has an opinion:
<http://viewvc.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=354>

It was submitted as a Fedora security update, which I'm letting through for
now, as better safe than sorry.

To sum it up, it looks like the mime type used to display a given file in
viewvc can be set via the URL.  Obviously this means that an attacker could
force an arbitrary mime type on any file in a viewvc repository.

It strikes me as not crossing a trust boundary though, as I suspect you'd need
something malicious in the repo in order for this to really be useful.  If the
bad guys can already add arbitrary content, you have bigger problems.

We also just received this report as upstream announced it as a security
issue. Nevertheless, I would follow your argument. A crafted link could at
worst case crash the browser. But as far as I can imagine nothing inside
the repository can be exploited by changing its mime-type at delivery.
