  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.5

  Impact: A remote attacker may be able to send mail directly to local users

  Description: An issue exists in the Postfix configuration files. For a period of one minute after a local command-line tool sends mail, postfix is accessible from the network. During this time, a remote entity who could connect to the SMTP port may send mail to local users and otherwise use the SMTP protocol. This issue does not cause the system to be an open mail relay. This issue is addressed by modifying the Postfix configuration to prevent SMTP connections from remote machines. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5 and does not affect Mac OS X Server. Credit to Pelle Johansson for reporting this issue.

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.5, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Impact: Systems that have been manually configured to use rlogin and host.equiv may unexpectedly permit root login

  Description: The manpage for the configuration file hosts.equiv indicates that entries do not apply to root. However, an implementation issue in rlogind causes these entries to also apply to root. This update addresses the issue by properly disallowing rlogin from the root user if the remote system is in hosts.equiv. The rlogin service is not enabled by default in Mac OS X, and must be manually configured in order to be enabled. Credit to Ralf Meyer for reporting this issue.

* **Script Editor**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-4214

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.5, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Description: An insecure file operation issue exists in the Script Editor application when opening application scripting dictionaries. A local user can cause the scripting dictionary to be written to an arbitrary path accessible by the user that is running the application. This update addresses the issue by creating the temporary file in a secure location. Credit: Apple.

* **Single Sign-On**

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.5, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Impact: The sso\_util command now accepts passwords from a file

  Description: The sso\_util command now accepts passwords from a file named in the SSO\_PASSWD\_PATH environment variable. This enables automated scripts to use sso\_util more securely.
