Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4469

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `coder_id` parameter of the `view_cresume.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `coder_id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords.
*   **Database Manipulation:** An attacker may be able to modify data, or perform other malicious database operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `view_cresume.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable Script:** `view_cresume.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `coder_id`
*   **Exploit Example:**  `http://site.il/view_cresume.php?coder_id=-1/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/1,2,password,user(),5/**/from/**/members/*`
    This exploit uses a UNION SELECT statement to extract data from the `members` table, specifically the `password` field, along with other information.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" risk.
*   The exploit is readily available and easy to use.
*   The CVSS base score is 7.5/10, with high exploitability.

**Summary:**
The identified vulnerability in Vastal I-Tech Freelance Zone is a classic SQL injection vulnerability that allows remote attackers to retrieve sensitive information from the database without any authentication. The lack of input sanitization in the `coder_id` parameter allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
