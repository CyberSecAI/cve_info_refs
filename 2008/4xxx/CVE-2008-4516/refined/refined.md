{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `galerie.php` file of the Galerie 3.2 addon for Burning Board Lite. Specifically, the `pic` parameter within the URL is vulnerable to SQL injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Blind SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to improper sanitization of the `pic` parameter.",
      "Lack of Input Sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, such as user passwords. This could lead to unauthorized access and potential compromise of the application and its associated user data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET Request: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `galerie.php` file, injecting SQL code within the `pic` parameter.",
      "Blind SQL Injection: The exploit uses a blind SQL injection technique to infer information from the database based on the response to manipulated queries."
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
