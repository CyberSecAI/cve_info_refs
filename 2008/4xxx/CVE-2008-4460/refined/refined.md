Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `game_id` parameter of the `game.php` script in Vastal I-Tech MMORPG Zone. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a database query.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically using a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the database.
* **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially:
    *   Bypass authentication.
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords (as shown in the exploit), and potentially other information depending on the database structure and table names.
* **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed via a web interface.
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a manipulated `game_id` parameter.
    *   The attacker injects SQL code into the `game_id` parameter, which allows them to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   No specific user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit demonstrates the use of `UNION SELECT` to retrieve data:

`http://site.il/game.php?yes=1&game_id=-1/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/1,concat_ws(0x3a,password,user()),3,4,5,6/**/members/*`

This URL attempts to:

1.  Set `game_id` to `-1` to ensure no legitimate data is returned.
2.  Use a `UNION SELECT` statement to combine the results of the original query with a new result set constructed using `SELECT`.
3.  The `SELECT` part then retrieves the `password` column and the database `user()`.
4.  The `concat_ws(0x3a,password,user())` function concatenates these values with a colon separator.

**More Detail than CVE:**

The content provides more detail than a standard CVE description by including:

*   Specific vulnerable URL and parameter (`game.php?yes=1&game_id=`)
*   Exact exploit string demonstrating the SQL injection.
*   Exploitation method using `UNION SELECT`.
*   Description of the potential for password extraction.
