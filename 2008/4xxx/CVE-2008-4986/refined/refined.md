Root cause of vulnerability:
The root cause of these vulnerabilities lies in the insecure creation of temporary files. Several scripts within different packages create temporary files in shared directories like /tmp without proper precautions.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The main vulnerability is the usage of predictable or shared temporary file locations, allowing for symlink attacks or race conditions. This occurs because the scripts create temporary files in the `/tmp` directory without using secure methods to ensure uniqueness and prevent manipulation.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to overwrite, delete, or modify arbitrary files that the vulnerable scripts have write access to. This could result in data loss, system compromise, or denial-of-service.

Attack vectors:
An attacker needs to create a symlink with the same name as the temporary file being created, pointing to a file they wish to manipulate. This is done before the vulnerable script creates its file, exploiting a race condition.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to have local user access to the system where the vulnerable scripts are run. They must be able to create symlinks in the directory where the temporary files are created, usually /tmp, and be able to predict the name the vulnerable script will use for its temp file
