Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4212:

**CVE-2008-4212**

*   **Root Cause:** An implementation issue in `rlogind` causes entries in the `hosts.equiv` configuration file to apply to the root user, despite the man page stating that they should not.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from incorrect interpretation/implementation of access control rules in `rlogind` related to the `hosts.equiv` file. Specifically, it fails to properly exclude root from the list of allowed users specified in hosts.equiv.
*  **Impact:** Systems configured to use rlogin and host.equiv may unexpectedly permit root login, potentially leading to unauthorized access with root privileges.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A remote attacker could attempt to log in as root from a machine listed in the target system's `hosts.equiv` file if the rlogin service is enabled.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker must be on a system that is listed in the target system's `hosts.equiv`.
    *   The `rlogin` service needs to be manually configured and enabled on the target machine (not enabled by default on macOS).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to systems where `rlogin` and `hosts.equiv` are manually configured and used.
*   The fix involves properly disallowing root login when the remote system is listed in `hosts.equiv`.
*   The provided document states the rlogin service is not enabled by default.
