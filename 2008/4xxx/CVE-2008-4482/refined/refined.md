Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4482 (although this is a placeholder, the content clearly relates to a vulnerability in Xerces-C++ that matches the description of a stack overflow due to a large `maxOccurs` value in an XML schema.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow in the `ContentSpecNode` destructor (`ContentSpecNode::~ContentSpecNode()`).
- This occurs when validating an XML file against a schema where an element has a `maxOccurs` attribute with a value greater than or equal to 200,000.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack overflow: The recursive nature of handling large `maxOccurs` values during the parsing process exceeds the stack memory capacity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The stack overflow leads to a crash of the parser application.
- The provided information suggests this could cause a complete program crash due to a stack overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted XML schema with an element declaration using a `maxOccurs` attribute with a value of 200,000 or greater, used for validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply an XML schema and an XML document to be parsed.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was present in Xerces-C++ version 2.3.0 and was fixed in version 3.0.0.
- A temporary workaround was implemented by limiting `maxOccurs` to -1 (unbounded) when it exceeds 500.
- The bug report notes this was identified under the Bugzilla ID 24703.
