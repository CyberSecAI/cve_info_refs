#### Description

Parser crashes in ContentSpecNode.hpp: ContentSpecNode::~ContentSpecNode().

Steps to reproduce:

validate a xml file against a schema with an element having a maxOccurs >=

200000.

Assumed cause:

Stack overfow

Makeshift resolution:

Set the repeat count to unbounded(-1), when maxOccurs > 500:

inline void ContentSpecNode::setMaxOccurs(int max)

{

if(max > 500)

max = -1;

fMaxOccurs = max;

}
