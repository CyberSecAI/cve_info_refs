# Adobe Flash Player: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200903-23**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified, the worst of which allow
arbitrary code execution on a user's system via a malicious Flash file.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-plugins/adobe-flash** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **10.0.22.87** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **10.0.22.87** |

### Background

The Adobe Flash Player is a renderer for the popular SWF file format,
which is commonly used to provide interactive websites, digital
experiences and mobile content.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Flash Player:

* The access scope of SystemsetClipboard() allows ActionScript
  programs to execute the method without user interaction
  (CVE-2008-3873).
* The access scope of FileReference.browse() and
  FileReference.download() allows ActionScript programs to execute the
  methods without user interaction (CVE-2008-4401).
* The Settings Manager controls can be disguised as normal graphical
  elements. This so-called "clickjacking" vulnerability was disclosed by
  Robert Hansen of SecTheory, Jeremiah Grossman of WhiteHat Security,
  Eduardo Vela, Matthew Mastracci of DotSpots, and Liu Die Yu of
  TopsecTianRongXin (CVE-2008-4503).
* Adan Barth (UC Berkely) and Collin Jackson (Stanford University)
  discovered a flaw occurring when interpreting HTTP response headers
  (CVE-2008-4818).
* Nathan McFeters and Rob Carter of Ernst and Young's Advanced
  Security Center are credited for finding an unspecified vulnerability
  facilitating DNS rebinding attacks (CVE-2008-4819).
* When used in a Mozilla browser, Adobe Flash Player does not
  properly interpret jar: URLs, according to a report by Gregory
  Fleischer of pseudo-flaw.net (CVE-2008-4821).
* Alex "kuza55" K. reported that Adobe Flash Player does not properly
  interpret policy files (CVE-2008-4822).
* The vendor credits Stefano Di Paola of Minded Security for
  reporting that an ActionScript attribute is not interpreted properly
  (CVE-2008-4823).
* Riley Hassell and Josh Zelonis of iSEC Partners reported multiple
  input validation errors (CVE-2008-4824).
* The aforementioned researchers also reported that ActionScript 2
  does not verify a member element's size when performing several known
  and other unspecified actions, that DefineConstantPool accepts an
  untrusted input value for a "constant count" and that character
  elements are not validated when retrieved from a data structure,
  possibly resulting in a null-pointer dereference (CVE-2008-5361,
  CVE-2008-5362, CVE-2008-5363).
* The vendor reported an unspecified arbitrary code execution
  vulnerability (CVE-2008-5499).
* Liu Die Yu of TopsecTianRongXin reported an unspecified flaw in the
  Settings Manager related to "clickjacking" (CVE-2009-0114).
* The vendor credits Roee Hay from IBM Rational Application Security
  for reporting an input validation error when processing SWF files
  (CVE-2009-0519).
* Javier Vicente Vallejo reported via the iDefense VCP that Adobe
  Flash does not remove object references properly, leading to a freed
  memory dereference (CVE-2009-0520).
* Josh Bressers of Red Hat and Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security
  Team reported an untrusted search path vulnerability
  (CVE-2009-0521).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted SWF
file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user or a Denial of Service (crash). Furthermore a
remote attacker could gain access to sensitive information, disclose
memory contents by enticing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file
inside a Flash application, modify the victim's clipboard or render it
temporarily unusable, persuade a user into uploading or downloading
files, bypass security restrictions with the assistance of the user to
gain access to camera and microphone, conduct Cross-Site Scripting and
HTTP Header Splitting attacks, bypass the "non-root domain policy" of
Flash, and gain escalated privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Adobe Flash Player users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-plugins/adobe-flash-10.0.22.87"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
