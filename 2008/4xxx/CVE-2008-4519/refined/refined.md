Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-4519:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `index.php` and `index2.php` files of the Fastpublish CMS application. This allows for both SQL injection and local file inclusion vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `sprache` parameter in `index2.php` and the `artikel` parameter in `index.php` when handling user-supplied input.
    *   The provided exploit examples use `UNION SELECT` statements to extract sensitive information from the database.
2.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   The application is vulnerable to LFI via the `target` parameter in both `index2.php` and `index.php` when handling user-supplied input.
    *   An attacker can include local files using relative paths like `../` in the `target` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker can extract sensitive database information, including user credentials (usernames, passwords, user types), and potentially other data stored in the database.
    *   This could lead to unauthorized access to the application and its data.
*  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.
    *   This may expose sensitive information like configuration files or source code, which could be leveraged for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** Both vulnerabilities are exploited through manipulated HTTP GET requests by modifying URL parameters.
    *   For SQL injection, parameters like `sprache` and `artikel` are targeted.
    *   For LFI, the `target` parameter is targeted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Fastpublish CMS application.
*   No authentication or prior knowledge of the system is explicitly required to exploit these vulnerabilities, indicating they are remotely exploitable.
* The attacker must know the path to the vulnerable `index.php` and `index2.php` files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also references CVE-2008-4518, indicating that the Fastpublish CMS had multiple vulnerabilities.
*   The exploits provided show how an attacker can extract user information from different database tables, demonstrating the severity of the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   The LFI vulnerability can be exploited using simple relative paths, indicating that the application doesn't have adequate checks.
* The identified vulnerable version is 1.9.9.9.9.d
