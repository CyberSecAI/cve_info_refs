### Autoimmunity disorder in Wireless LAN

##### Md Sohail Ahmad

 *Senior Wireless Security Researcher, Airtight Networks Inc.*
##### JVR Murthy

 *Senior Wireless Security Researcher, Airtight Networks Inc.*
##### Amit Vartak

 *Senior Wireless Security Researcher, Airtight Networks Inc.*

An autoimmune disorder is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. This presentation is about discovery of autoimmunity disorder in select open source and commercial 802.11 AP implementations. By sending specially crafted packets, it is possible to trigger autoimmunity disorder and cause AP to turn hostile against its own clients. Eight examples of autoimmune disorder will be demonstrated.

Autoimmunity disorder can be exploited to craft new DoS attacks. Although 802.11w promises immunity from DoS attacks, we show that autoimmunity disorder leaves a door open through which DoS attacks can still be launched. One example of DoS attack against MFP(11w) will be demonstrated.

**Md Sohail Ahmad** is a wireless security researcher in AirTight Networks. Mr Ahmad possesses strong background in secure driver development, protocol development, and open source tool development. He is currently working on mitigation of various security aspects of IEEE802.11w and IEEE 802.11n standards and in its implementations.

Prior to this, he has also demonstrated the more potent form of Evil Twin Attack called "Multipot" in Defcon-15. He has discovered "Caffe Latte" attack which was presented in ToorCon9, which is about retrieving WEP key from an isolated client in the absence of its authorized access point.

### The Anatomy of a Subway Hack:

##### Breaking Crypto RFID's and Magstripes of Ticketing Systems

##### Zack Anderson

 *Student, MIT*
##### RJ Ryan

 *Student, MIT*
##### Alessandro Chiesa

 *Student, MIT*

In this talk we go over weaknesses in common subway fare collection systems. We focus on the Boston T subway, and show how we reverse engineered the data on magstripe card, we present several attacks to completely break the CharlieCard, a MIFARE Classic smartcard used in many subways around the world, and we discuss physical security problems. We will discuss practical brute force attacks using FPGAs and how to use software-radio to read RFID cards. We survey 'human factors' that lead to weaknesses in the system, and we present a novel new method of hacking WiFi: WARCARTING. We will release several open source tools we wrote in the process of researching these attacks. With live demos, we will demonstrate how we broke these systems.

**Zack Anderson** is studying electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. He is an avid hardware and software hacker, and has built several systems such as an autonomous vehicle for the DARPA Grand Challenge. Zack is especially interested in the security of embedded systems and wireless communications. He has experience building and breaking CDMA cellular systems and RFID. Zack has worked for a security/intelligence firm, and has multiple patents pending. He enjoys building systems as much as he enjoys breaking them.

**RJ Ryan** is researcher at MIT. His longtime passion for security has resulted in a number of hacks and projects, including a steganographic cryptography protocol. RJ works on a number of technical projects ranging from computer security to operating systems, distributed computation, compilers, and computer graphics. He enjoys learning how things work, and how to make things work for him.

### Digital Security: a Risky Business

##### Ian O. Angell

 *Professor of Information Systems. London School of Economics*

In this talk Professor Angell will take the devil’s advocate position, warning that computer technology is part of the problem as well as of the solution. The belief system at the core of computerization is positivist and/or statistical, and that itself leads to risk. The mixture of computers and human activity systems spawns bureaucracy and systemic risk, which can throw up singularities that defy any positivist/statistical analysis. Using black humour, Angell discusses the thin line between the utility of computers and the hazard of chaotic feedback, and ends with some advice on how to survive and prosper amongst all this complexity.

**Ian Angell** has been Professor of Information Systems at the London School of Economics since 1986. Prior to that he researched and taught Computer Science at Royal Holloway College, and University College London.

Angell has very radical and constructive views on his subject, and is very critical of what he calls the pseudo-science of academic Information Systems. He has gained a certain notoriety worldwide for his aggressive polemics against the inappropriate use of artificial intelligence and so-called knowledge management, and against the hyperbole surrounding e-commerce.

His main research work concentrates on organizational and national I.T. policies, on strategic information systems, and on computers and risk (both opportunities and hazards), particularly the systemic risks inherent in all socio-technical systems and the security threats posed to organisations by the rapidly diffusing international information infrastructure.

### VulnCatcher: Fun with Vtrace and Programmatic Debugging

##### atlas

Countless hours are spent researching vulnerabilities in proprietary and open source software for each bug found. Many indicators of potential vulnerabilities are visible both in the disassembly and debugging, if you know what to look for. How much can be automated? VulnCatcher illustrates the power of programmatic debugging using the VTRACE libraries for cross-platform debugging.

**atlas** a disciple of the illustrious Skodo, has a history in programming, systems support, telecom, security, and reverse engineering. His introduction to the hard-core hacking world was through dc13's CTF Qualifiers. Captain of two-time CTF-winner "1@stplace" and individual winner of CTF-2005, atlas has released hacking tools and toolkits such as disass, atlasutils, and is co-maintainer of the python library for x86 disassembly: libdisassemble.

### Pen-Testing is Dead, Long Live the Pen Test

##### Taylor Banks

 *Security Evangelist*
##### Carric

 *DEFCON Goon*

This talk explores the death and subsequent re-birth of the penetration test. Comprised of conclusions drawn from the collective experiences of two seasoned pen-testers, our talk is filled with facts, fun and rhetoric. We will describe the landscape, the problems, and offer real solutions.

In our talk, we will explore the problems with modern-day pen-tests and pen-testers, and ways to stand out amongst the frauds selling their lackluster vuln-scan services under the guise of a true penetration test.

We discuss penetration tests that are overly tool-driven and/or lacking in methodology as well as pen-testers who lack the experience and creativity to identify the architectural problems that real attackers frequently exploit.

Along the way, we'll discuss the difficulties faced by real penetration testers and complement these with real-world war-stories to provide both context and comic relief.

Most importantly, we'll discuss how to solve these problems, through contributions to open methodologies, transparency in process, and shifts in technological paradigms. We'll tell you how to deal with the latest technologies, even those that change day-by-day. For those that take penetration testing seriously, this talk will be a fun, informative and enlightening presentation on the things we need to do to keep pen-testing worthwhile. Attendees will learn how to perform pentests accurately and obtain compelling and valuable results that ensure real return on investment for their clients.

**Taylor Banks** is a security evangelist and privacy pundit with over 15 years in the information technology industry, the last 10 focused exclusively on information security and privacy. Since 1998, he has been designing, implementing, teaching and managing secure information systems for Federal Government, US Military, private universities and public companies, from start-ups to Fortune 100. Taylor, aka "dr.kaos," is also the PoC for the Atlanta DEFCON Group (DC404), and in 2005 founded "kaos theory security research," creators of the Anonym.OS LiveCD. Between 1999 and 2002, Taylor worked at SecureIT (later acquired by VeriSign) providing CheckPoint, Nokia, NAI, Web Security and Applied Hacking training to hundreds of enterprise customers, as well as review, design and development of secure network architecture and related security policies for numerous Fortune 500 organizations. During that time, Mr. Banks devised testing methodologies and audit procedures, and helped found the VeriSign FIRE team to provide penetration tests and security audits for internal departments and enterprise customers. In 2003, Taylor trained the US Marine Corps 13-member Computer Emergency Response Team (MARCERT) to perform penetration tests and security audits to assess and improve the security of their own military and public networks. The MARCERT team subsequently entered DEFCON's prestigious CTF competition, ranking 3rd at the conclusion of the DEFCON XI conference. Since 2007, Taylor has been focused on virtualization and its impact on enterprise information security.

### Owning the Users with The Middler

##### Jay Beale

 *Senior Security Consultant and Co-Founder, Intelguardians Network Intelligence, Inc.*

This talk introduces a new open source, plugin-extensible attack tool for exploiting web applications that use cleartext HTTP, if only to redirect the user to the HTTPS site. We'll demonstrate attacks on online banking as well as Gmail, LinkedIn, LiveJournal and Facebook. We'll also compromise computers and an iPhone by subverting their software installation and update process. We'll inject Javascript into browser sessions and demonstrate CSRF attacks.

Our new tool, The Middler, automates these attacks to make exploiting every active user on your computer's network brain-dead easy and scalable. It has an interactive mode, but also has a fire-and-forget mode that can perform these attacks automatically without interaction. Written in Ruby, this tool is easy to both extend and add into other tools.

### They're Hacking Our Clients! Introducing Free Client-side Intrusion Prevention

##### Jay Beale

 *Senior Security Consultant and Co-Founder, Intelguardians Network Intelligence, Inc.*

In the face of far stronger firewall and IPS-protected perimeters,attackers are compromising far more systems by hacking our web browsers, e-mail clients, and office document tools. Unfortunately,vulnerability assessment practices still focus on checking listening services, even on workstations. Detecting vulnerable clients is left for patch management tools, which aren't in consistent or wide enough use. Even when organizations are able to invest the time and money in a patch management system, a series of critical problems keeps the botnet builders in business.This talk, by Bastille UNIX creator Jay Beale, introduces a free tool to detect vulnerable clients and keep them out of the botnets.

### When Lawyers Attack! Dealing with the New Rules of Electronic Discovery

##### John Benson "jur1st"

 *Electronic Discovery Consultant*

The legal community is slowly accepting that the changes to the Federal rules which change the law's approach to electronic evidence are not going away. Vendors are clamoring to sell their e-discovery "solutions" to law firms and corporations alike, often taking advantage of the uncertainty that comes with such sweeping changes to the law.

The changes to the Federal Rules change the way in which individuals and organizations approach their data much in the same way Sarbanes- Oxley has over the past few years. Instead of merely creating compliance headaches for security professionals, however, these changes take data security out of the hands of those charged to protect it and spread data to the wind.

More frightening for individuals doing security research is the fact that these rules apply to the one man research operation as the multimillion dollar conglomerate in the same way.

This talk outlines how the electronic discovery process works, why it is costing corporations millions of dollars (but doesn't have to) and will empower attendees with the knowledge they need to deal with this new legal environment.

 **John Benson** currently works as an electronic discovery consultant at a large Kansas City law firm. A graduate of the University of Missouri from both Columbia and Kansas City campuses, he is a member of the Missouri Bar Association and serves as the chairman of the Kansas City Metropolitan Bar Association Computer Law and Technology Committee. He has taught law, ethics and (oddly enough) finance as an adjunct professor at The Colorado Technical University. In 2008 he founded the Cowtown Computer Congress, a hackerspace and umbrella organization for the advancement of user-driven technology activities in Kansas City. He has presented at hacker cons around the country including LayerOne, Pumpcon, Shmoocon and DEFCON. He can be found on the DEFCON boards and assisting with radio communications at DEFCON.

### The emergence (and use) of Open Source Warfare

##### Peter Berghammer

 *CEO, Copernio Holding Company*

The presentation will deal briefly (20 minutes) with the concepts surrounding Open Source Warfare (OSW) and broader adoption for use not only within the context of war fighting, but also its uses within the political arena in order to influence opinion.

The presentation will only deal with publicly available data, couple with real world deployment examples. It WILL NOT contain any type of classified data or anything that can be construed as such.

OSW has become a highly lucrative area that covers topics such as computer security, shaping of potential battlefields and populations, and actual in the field uses of mutated electronics devices such as microwave ovens, model rockets, remote controlled aircraft as well as computer based command and control protocols. What is so particularly interesting in this presentation (as well as the field itself) is how under funded and ill-equipped insurgency (and counter insurgency) groups can make use of off-the-shelf technology to fight against vastly better funded armies. It will also examine communications methods of these groups - and how they approach not only Internet style communication (and in some cases set up their own superior communications networks) but also how they approach communications security.

**Peter Berghammer** CEO of Copernio (founded 2001), is an accomplished aerospace, semiconductor and optical disc industry professional. Though best known for his marketing acumen, he also possesses a thorough understanding and appreciation for strategic alliances, acquisitions, and mergers. He is noted for the rapid expansion of The Copernio Holding Company ñ taking it from simply an IT solutions provider to an organization with divisions handling consulting, research, warehousing & logistics. Under his tenure, Copernio has expanded from a single location to an international corporation with warehouses and offices in over eighteen countries. His goal however has always remained the same: to assist clients achieve their business objectives through the intelligent and efficient use of information technology and infrastructure.

### What To Do When Your Data Winds Up Where It Shouldn't

##### Don Blumenthal

 *DMB & Associates*

Stories about the loss of sensitive data are becoming more common, and an untold number of others probably are not known because they were not covered by law or did not get the attention of regulators. A loss may happen when data is stolen or simply lost, or when a system is breached. Existing federal and state laws cover specific industries and prescribe particular responses, but pending legislative proposals threaten to expand coverage significantly. This presentation will discuss the relevant federal and state laws concerning disclosure of sensitive information. In addition, it will explore the elements of a plan for responding to a data loss and the considerations that occur should that plan have to be put into use. These plans, elements, and considerations are critical for addressing a data loss and for dealing with such disparate groups as regulators, the public, employees, and shareholders after your, and their, data is gone.

**Don Blumenthal** is a professional with over 20 years proven experience in technology, law, and policy, and has worked on data breach matters from both the law enforcement and private sector sides.

### Working with Law Enforcement

##### Don M. Blumenthal

 *DMB & Associates*

Security-related laws and regulations, with parallel privacy measures, are assuming an ever-expanding role in American society. As a result, the likelihood that an organization will receive a call, visit, subpoena, or letter from a law enforcement agency is constantly increasing. This program will address issues related to addressing these contacts. It will explore relevant legal questions but also the real world processes and considerations that should go into protecting private sector interests, and even lessening the burden of government inquiries. In addition, it will discuss considerations concerning proactive fostering of relationships with law enforcement to mutual benefit.

### Generic, Decentralized, Unstoppable Anonymity: The Phantom Protocol

##### Magnus Bråding

 *Security Researcher, Fortego Security*

Recent years, and especially this past year, have seen a notable upswing in developments toward anti online privacy around the world, primarily in the form of draconian surveillance and censorship laws (both passed and attempted) and ISPs being pressured into individually acting as both police and informants for commercial interests. Once such first steps are taken, it's of course also of huge concern how these newly created possibilities could be used outside of their originally stated bounds, and what the future of such developments may be.

There are no signs of this trend being broken anytime soon, and combined with the ever growing online migration of everything in general, and privacy sensitive activities in particular (like e.g. voting and all kinds of discussions and other personal groupings), this will in turn unavoidably lead to a huge demand for online anonymization tools and similar privacy means.

If not designed carefully though, such anonymization tools will yet again be easy targets for additional draconian legislation and directed (il)legal pressure from big commercial interests. Thus, a good, robust and theoretically secure design for an anonymization protocol and infrastructure is needed, which is exactly what is set out to be done with this project.

What is presented in this talk is the design of a protocol and complete system for anonymization, intended as a candidate for a free, open, community owned, de facto anonymization standard, vastly improving on existing solutions such as TOR, and having the following important main properties and design goals:

1. Completely decentralized.

   - No critical or weak points to attack or put (il)legal pressure on.

3. Maximum resistance against all kinds of DoS attacks.

   - Direct technical destructive attacks will practically be the only possible way to even attempt to stop it.

5. Theoretically secure anonymization.

   - Probabilistic methods (contrary to deterministic methods) must be used in a completely decentralized design like this, where no other peer can be trusted, so focus is put on optimizing these methods.

7. Theoretically secure end-to-end transport encryption.

   - This is simple in itself, but still important in the context of anonymization.

9. Completely (virtually) isolated from the "normal" Internet.

   - No one should have to worry about crimes being perpetrated from their own IP address.

11. Maximum protection against identification of protocol usage through traffic analysis.

    - You never know what the next draconian law might be.

13. Capable of handling larger data volumes, with acceptable throughput.

    - Most existing anonymization solutions are practically unusable for (or even prohibit) larger data volumes.

15. Generic and well-abstracted design, compatible with all new and existing network enabled software.

    - Software application developer participation should not be needed, it should be easy to apply the anonymization to both new and already existing products like e.g. web browsers and file transfer software.

The Phantom protocol has been designed to meet all these requirements, and will be presented in this talk.

### Buying Time - What is your Data Worth?

##### (A generalized Solution to distributed Brute Force attacks)

##### Adam Bregenzer

 *Security Researcher*

Brute Force attacks are often marginalized as a user issue or discounted as a non-issue because of sufficient password complexity. Because rainbow tables have provided a re-invigoration of this type of attack, maintaining password security is simply not enough. In this session, I will be releasing a framework for easily creating a brute force attack tool that is both multithreaded and distributed across multiple machines. As computing power continues to grow along with the ability to rent cycles and storage space, it becomes reasonable to add a money-time trade-off to brute force and dictionary attacks. Distributed computing combined with rainbow tables mean brute force attacks can now be very effective. I will present a version of a popular brute force tool which I modified to increase its speed by several orders of magnitude. Additionally I will demonstrate how to adopt an existing tool to utilize this framework.

**Adam Bregenzer** is actively involved in technology research and development. As a charter member of the kaos.theory computer security consortium, he developed and presented various projects to the Information Security industry at a number of national conventions.

### Bypassing pre-boot authentication passwords

##### by instrumenting the BIOS keyboard buffer (practical low level attacks against x86 pre-boot authentication software)

##### Jonanthan Brossard

 *Lead Security Researcher, Iviz*

Pre-boot authentication software, in particular full hard disk encryption software, play a key role in preventing information theft. In this paper, we present a new class of vulnerability affecting multiple high value pre-boot authentication software, including the latest Microsoft disk encryption technology : Microsoft Vista's Bitlocker, with TPM chip enabled. Because Pre-boot authentication software programmers commonly make wrong assumptions about the inner workings of the BIOS interruptions responsible for handling keyboard input, they typically use the BIOS API without flushing or initializing the BIOS internal keyboard buffer. Therefore, any user input including plain text passwords remains in memory at a given physical location. In this article, we first present a detailed analysis of this new class of vulnerability and generic exploits for Windows and Unix platforms under x86 architectures. Unlike current academic research aiming at extracting information from the RAM, our practical methodology does not require any physical access to the computer to extract plain text passwords from the physical memory. In a second part, we will present how this information leakage combined with usage of the BIOS API without careful initialization of the BIOS keyboard buffer can lead to computer reboot without console access and full security bypass of the pre-boot authentication pin if an attacker has enough privileges to modify the bootloader. Other related work include information leakage from CPU caches, reading physical memory thanks to firewire and switching CPU modes.

**Jonanthan Brossard** is French,and has recently moved to India to build and lead the research and exploitation team of Iviz (http://www.ivizindia.com/iviz/aboutus.html). Jonathan's daily activities involve exploit writing, reverse engineering, code auditing and research in disruptive low level hacking methodologies.

Before moving to India, Jonathan worked as a security researcher in the Defense area in France for Sagem Defense Securite, where he designed and patented new protection schemes for protecting applications against reverse engineering under GNU/Linux architectures. Prior to that position, He has also worked in French pioneer pentesting consulting company Edelweb. Therefore he has experience with both ends of the security industry...

During college, Jonathan was employed as a network administrator of one of the major school network in France, which gave him a strong taste for networking and network security.

Jonathan started getting interested with low level security issues more than 10 years ago, when he learnt x86 asm under MS-DOS. Many things have changed since those good old times of real mode OSes, but there is still room for surprises... Low level attacks involving deep knowledge of computers internals are not dead... just read the paper ;) Jonathan would also like to mention his ties to excellent security research groups such as pulltheplug.org and blacksecurity.org :this is where public information ends and where security research begins...

### Grendel-Scan: A new web application scanning tool

##### David Byrne

 *Security Consultant, Trustwave*
##### Eric Duprey

 *Senior Security Engineer, Dish Network*

While commercial web application scanners have been available for quite a while, the selection of open source tools has been limited. Grendel-Scan is a new tool that aims to provide in-depth application assessment. Written entirely in Java and featuring an easy to use GUI, the tool is intended to be useful to a wide variety of technical backgrounds: from IT security managers, to experienced penetration testers.

Grendel-Scan can test for authentication and authorization bypass, SQL injection (blind and error-based), XSS, CRLF injection / response splitting, session key strength, session fixation, file/directory/backup enumeration, directory indexing, web server mis-configuration, and other vulnerabilities. Exploration of the web application can be accomplished through an embedded proxy server, via automated spidering, or search engine reconnaissance.

The accuracy of the testing is increased by powerful features such as automatic detection and correction of logged out sessions, heuristic file-not-found detection, and an embedded HTML DOM parser and JavaScript engine for full page analysis. Grendel-Scan was architected with extensibility in mind. Powerful libraries offering features such as input/output tracing, session tracking, or HTML DOM comparisons make the development of new test modules much easier.

The presentation will feature an overview of the application's design, results of comparative analysis against similar tools, and a live demonstration of the tool using a real application (not an intentionally vulnerable app).

### Building a Real Session Layer

##### D.J. Capelis

It's past time for a session layer. It's time to replace port knocking with a real authentication framework. It's time to do what DNS did with IP addresses to port numbers. It's time to run services over NATs, eliminate the need for vhosts in your webserver and provide optional transparent encryption for any client who wants it. In this talk, we'll do that and a couple other tricks... within the framework of a little-known RFC that was written almost 2 decades ago.

**D.J. Capelis** spends his time at University of California, San Diego eating pizza. A portion of the remaining time is dedicated to research on building more secure computer systems. His latest research areas include building trusted platforms that aren't evil, looking for the next hot thing among old ideas and raining on the

### Hacking Desire

##### Ian Clarke

 *CEO, Uprizer Labs LLC & Coordinator, The Freenet Project*

What do you want? This is the question that almost every commercial organization on the planet thinks they have an answer to, but do they? Figuring out what people want is essentially a process of reverse engineering human needs, desire, and preference. It turns out that hackers are particularly adept at reverse engineering, so what happened when we applied our skills to reverse engineering what you, and everyone else, wants?

This talk will describe how we constructed a model for how the human mind decides what it wants, and then customize this model to imitate particular individuals, and thus anticipate specifically what they want. I will demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on guessing how much particular users will like particular movies, based on the feedback they've given to a popular movie rental website. I'll also discuss flaws in how "collaborative filters" are designed, and measured, and explain why our approach is an improvement.

This talk will discuss sophisticated ideas in machine learning and artificial intelligence, but no background in these topics will be required for attendees.

**Ian Clarke** is a Computer Scientist and Entrepreneur, with a track record of both technical and business innovation, and an outspoken thinker and activist on issues relating to freedom of speech, intellectual property law, and technology.

### Climbing Everest: An Insider's Look at one state's Voting Systems

##### Sandy Clark "Mouse"

 *University of Pennsylvania*

Hanging Chads, Hopping votes, Flipped votes, Tripled votes, Missing memory cards, Machine malfunctions, Software glitches, Undervotes, Overvotes. Reports of voting machine failures flooded the news after the last elections and left most voters wondering "Does my vote really count?" "Can these electronic voting machines be trusted?" "How secure are my state's voting systems?"

In December 2007, we published an in depth, source code and hardware analysis of all the voting systems used by the state of Ohio, funded by the Ohio Secretary of State. Come find out what we learned, and draw your own conclusions.

### Could Googling Take Down a President, a Prime Minister, or an Average Citizen?

##### Greg Conti

 *United States Military Academy*

Every time we use the web, we disclosure tremendous amounts of information to ISPs, Internet backbone providers, and online companies; information that will be shared and data mined, but rarely discarded. Email addresses, phone numbers, aggregated search queries, cookies, IP addresses - any unique feature of our behavior provides a mechanism to link, profile, and identify users, groups, and companies. From these revelations all aspects of our daily lives emerge, including our activities, locations, and social networks. Making matters worse, ubiquitous advertising networks, dominant online companies, complicit network providers, and popular web analytic services possess the ability to track, and in some cases, eavesdrop on and modify our online communications.

The AOL dataset debacle and subsequent public outrage illustrated one facet of the problem - Search. This talk covers all aspects of the problem, including end user computers, network providers, online companies, and advertising networks. It also includes countermeasures to help protect your personal and organizational privacy. It is important to note that the research presented is the inverse of Google Hacking, which strives to retrieve sensitive information from the databases of search engines. This talk instead focuses on what information online companies can pull from you, as well as what network providers can see and modify. The long-term implications of web-based information disclosure are profound. Interaction by interaction we are ceding power to ISPs and online companies, disclosures which may one day alter the course of elections, remove world leaders from power, or cause the outspoken citizen to disappear from the web.

### Compromising Windows Based Internet Kiosks

##### Paul Craig

 *Principal Security Consultant, Security-Assessment.com*

Internet Kiosks have become common place in today's Internet centric society. Public Internet Kiosks can be found everywhere, from Airports, Train stations, Libraries and Hotels to corporate lobbies and street corners. Kiosks are used by thousands of users daily from all different walks of life, creed, and social status.

Internet kiosk terminals often implement custom browser software which rely on proprietary security mechanisms and access controls. Kiosks are designed to limit the level of access a user has to the Internet kiosk, and attempt to thwart malicious activity. Kiosk users are prohibited from accessing the Kiosk's local file system, or the surrounding local network attached to the Kiosk. The only guaranteed functionality is a "secured" web-browser. For a service so common-place, there has been practically zero research regarding the security of Internet Kiosk software. This talk will cover Internet Kiosk software exploitation techniques, and demonstrate multiple methods of compromising Windows based Internet Kiosk terminals.

### Shifting the Focus of WiFi Security: Beyond cracking your neighbor's wep key

##### Thomas d'Otreppe de Bouvette "Mister\_X"

##### Rick Farina "Zero\_Chaos"

In this talk we will discuss the paradigm shift of WiFi attacks away from the Access Points and focusing toward the clients. We will cover in depth how simple tricks such as HoneyPot Access Points or even hotspotter simply are not enough anymore and more flexible and powerful methods are being developed and used. The older, dated technologies built into Access Points for ensuring network security have failed the test of time paving way for new overlay security vendors to begin selling "Wireless Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems" to fill the gap left by the Access Point manufacturers and the ieee802.11 committee.

We will explore a variety of feature of these devices, and see what claims stack up and which ones do not. Finally, we will explore a new frontier for WiFi networks, licensed frequencies. Many vendors currently ship ieee 802.11 compliant devices that operate on non-public bands. We will explore what types of things you can find with some simple driver modifications and why the current generation of tools needs to improve to play by these new rules. If you want to learn about what wireless hacking will look like in the coming year, instead of just cracking wep, you can't afford to miss this talk.

### Hacking Data Retention: Small Sister your digital privacy self defense

##### Brenno De Winter

 *J.S.A.A.F., De Winter Information Solutions*

Over the last couple of years a range of privacy threats have been in occurring. Europe is starting to look like the playing field of what is to come to the US: Storage of all e-mail traffic, online presence, phone calls, actual traveling throughout nations and filtering of content. Fortunately a closer look at the measures shows that it is never smart to overestimate the abilities European governments have and digital self defense is possible. But since we don't want to underestimate the threat as well. So that's why we look how these measures effects can be greatly reduced and how we can have fun online again. This knowledge is something we probably want to extend to many people to help them reclaim their digital rights with the use of simple and existing technologies. The Small Sister Project shows you how to do that and delivers the tools to make that easier. Learn how simple measures can make a huge difference.

**Brenno De Winter** started experimenting with security at the age of 9. He has a background in open source that dates back to 1993 and he contributed to several projects like MySQL, GnuPG, Gnucomo (Gnu Computer Monitoring) and recently started the Small Sister-project for privacy-friendly internet usage.

### Security and anonymity vulnerabilities in Tor: past, present, and future

##### Roger Dingledine

 *Project leader, The Tor Project*

There have been a number of exciting bugs and design flaws in Tor over the years, with effects ranging from complete anonymity compromise to remote code execution. Some of them are our fault, and some are the fault of components (libraries, browsers, operating systems) that we trusted. Further, the academic research community has been coming up with increasingly esoteric --- and increasingly effective! --- attacks against all anonymity designs, including Tor.

Roger will walk through some of the most egregious bugs and design flaws we've had, and give some intuition about lessons learned building and deploying the largest distributed anonymity network ever. Then he'll outline the wide variety of current vulnerabilities we have, explain what they mean for our users, and talk about which ones we have a plan for and which ones will continue to be a pain for the coming years. Last, we'll speculate about categories and topics that are likely to
introduce new problems in the future.

**Roger Dingledine** is project leader for The Tor Project. The Tor network has grown to over 1500 relays handling traffic for hundreds of thousands of users daily. In the past few years The Tor Project has also gotten an increasingly diverse set of funders, become an official 501c3 nonprofit, and expanded its community of both volunteer and funded developers.

In addition to all the hats he wears for Tor, Roger organizes academic conferences on anonymity and security, speaks at industry and hacker cons, and does tutorials on anonymity for national and foreign law enforcement.

### Next Generation Collaborative Reversing with Ida Pro and CollabREate

##### Chris Eagle

 *Associate Chairman of the Computer Science Dept, Naval Postgraduate School (NPS)*
##### Tim Vidas

*Research Associate, Naval Postgraduate School (NPS)*

A major drawback with the use of most reverse engineering tools is that they were not designed with collaboration in mind. Numerous kludgy solutions exist from asynchronous use of the same data files to working on multiple copies of data files which quickly diverge leaving the differences to somehow be reconciled. Pedram Amini's Ida Sync provided a first step towards automated collaboration among Ida users however Ida Sync suffers from several shortcomings including the fact that it has failed to keep pace with the evolution of Ida's internal architecture. In this presentation, the authors present a new tool titled collabREate designed to bring nearly effortless collaboration to Ida users. The talk will include discussion of the IDA API and the ways in which it facilitates collaboration along with the ways in which it hinders collaboration. The design of a robust server component, responsible for managing projects and connected clients will also be discussed along with a number of capabilities beyond simple collaboration that are enabled via the collabREate architecture..

### Markets for Malware: A Structural Economic Approach

##### Brian K. Edwards

 *Economist, Los Alamos National Laboratory*
##### Silvio J. Flaim

 *Economist, Los Alamos National Laboratory*

Much literature has addressed the issue of the relative sizes of shadow economies in different countries. What is largely missing from this discussion is a more structured discussion on how to incorporate estimates of shadow economic activity into the national income accounting framework and a discussion of how the shadow components of specific industries can be analyzed in either an input-output or macroeconomic framework. After a brief discussion of existing estimates of black market activity, we discuss how black market activities might be measured and incorporated in standard economic models of the economy. We then focus particular attention on the malware industry and discuss how malware activity influences other economic activity (both official and shadow) and discuss possible methods of how malware activity can be estimated, and how the contribution of malware to overall economic activity can be measured. Finally, we discuss how the methods used to integrate malware economic activity into the national income accounts can be applied to other sectors of the economy, and hence how to develop an alternative measure of the size of the shadow economy. With a new baseline incorporating these "shadow" activities, the economic model is used to examine questions such as: What is the net economic contribution of malware and other shadow economic activity? What would be economic impact of eliminating malware and other shadow activity in all its forms?

Think that latest buffer overflow or XSS exploit matters? It doesn't. Think your network is secure because you have the latest and greatest IPS? It isn't. The truth is all exploits or defenses on their own are worthless; it's how you use your tools and respond to incidents that really matters. This panel, composed of top vulnerability and security researchers, will roll through a rapid-fire series of demonstrations as they smash through the security of popular consumer and enterprise devices and systems, often using simple techniques rather than the latest 0day exploits (but we'll see a few of those too). They'll then debate the value of any single attack vector or defense, and show how it's the practical application of attacks, defenses, and (more importantly) responses that really matters. From iPhones to browsers to SCADA, it isn't your advanced attack or defensive tool that matters, it's what you do with it.

##### Michael Piatek

 *PhD Student, University of Washington*

Our talk will start with some of our latest and greatest hacks. In 2003 we were the first to analyze the security of **Diebold's AccuVote-TS voting machine** software. We'll discuss the inside scoop on how we got the code, broke it, and then went public. In 2008 we also published the first attacks against a real, common wireless implantable medical device – an **implantable defibrillator and pacemaker** – and we did so using off-the-shelf software radios. What else will we talk about? Well, there was our research in measuring just how frequently **ISPs are injecting ads** into people's web pages, our **framing of network printers for copyright infringement** (and receiving DMCA takedown notices to those printers), our invention of clock skew-based **remote physical device fingerprinting**, and much more.

Are we hackers? No, we're scientists at a leading public university. So what turns hacking into "science" when it's done by academics? We'll answer these and other questions in the second half of the talk, which is geared to give you an inside glimpse into the world of academic security research. Along the way we'll answer questions like: How do we choose which technologies to hack – or as we say – "analyze," "study," and "investigate?" What might we hack next? What can we do as academic researchers in public institutions that industry researchers can't? What ethical and legal issues do we need to consider? And why is what we do considered "science?"

Anyone who doesn't want their product to be the next technology hacked (sorry, "studied") by academics like us should definitely attend this talk. And, of course, come to this talk if you're considering grad school in computer security. We'll also debate how academics and industry security researchers could better work together. Here we'd particularly like your feedback. What can academics learn from you? What do you think we could do better? What would you like us to look at next?

(Standard academic disclaimer: Many of the works will discuss were previously published in conjunction with other researchers. We'll acknowledge all relevant parties in the talk.)

### Panel: Internet Wars 2008

##### Gadi Evron

 *Moderator*

Some of the panel members in previous years:

Andrew Fried IRS

Thomas Grasso FBI

Dan Hubbard Websense

Dan Kaminsky IOActive

Randy Vaughn Baylor

Paul Vixie ISC

This year's panel members will be announced closer to the conference date.

Continuing our new tradition from the past two years, leading experts from different industries, academia and law enforcement will go on stage and participate in this panel, discussing the current threats on and to the Internet, from regular cyber-crime all the way to the mafia, and even some information warfare.

In this panel session we will begin with a short (2-5 minutes) introductory presentation from Gadi Evron on the latest technologies and operations by the Bad Guys and the Good Guys. What's going on with Internet operations, global routing, botnets, extortion, phishing and the annual revenue the mafia is getting from it. The members will accept questions on any subject related to the topic at hand, and discuss it openly in regard to what's being done and what we can expect in the future, both from the Bad Guys and the Good Guys.

Discussion is to be limited to issues happening on the Internet, rather than this or that vulnerability. The discussion is mostly technological and operational in nature, although for example two years ago attendees chose to ask questions directing the discussion to the legal side of things. Participants are people who are involved with battling cyber-crime daily, and are some of the leaders in the security operations community of the Internet.

**Gadi Evron** is recognized globally for his work and leadership in Internet security operations. He is the founder of the Zeroday Emergency Response Team (ZERT), organizes and chairs worldwide conferences, working groups and task forces. He is considered an expert on corporate security and counterespionage, botnets, e-fraud and phishing. Previously, Gadi was CISO at the Israeli government ISP (eGovernment project) and founded the Israeli Government CERT. Gadi authored two books on information security and is a frequent lecturer.

### Snort Plug-in Development: Teaching an Old Pig New Tricks

##### Ben Feinstein

 *Security Researcher, SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit*

Snort has become a standard component of many IT security environments. Snort is mature and widely deployed, and is no longer viewed as new or exciting by the industry. However, with such widespread deployment, enhancing Snort’s capabilities offers the potential for a large and immediate impact. Instead of chasing the industry’s new-hotness of the day, it frequently makes more sense to add new capabilities to an existing security control.

With this in mind, the author set out to implement new and innovative capabilities in the form of GPL-licensed Snort plug-ins. The author will introduce the Snort plug-in architecture and the relevant APIs used when implementing extensions to Snort. Lessons learned and pitfalls to avoid when developing Snort plug-ins will be covered. Some interesting code snippets will be discussed. Ideas for future work in the area of Snort extensions will be presented.

### The Wide World of WAFs

##### Ben Feinstein

 *Security Researcher, SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit*

With webapp protection now mandated by the PCI standard, web-application firewalls (WAFs) have received newfound interest from both consumers of security technologies, as well as from security researchers and potential attackers. Now that WAFs are a PCI-approved substitute for code reviews, expect many vendors to opt for this potentially less costly route to compliance. Of course, security researchers and potential attacks will increasingly train their sights on this lucrative and expanding target.

This talk will explore the ModSecurity Apache module and how it is being used as a WAF to meet the PCI 6.6 webapp protection requirement. The relative strengths and weaknesses of WAFs in general and ModSecurity in particular will be highlighted. Common deployment scenarios will be discussed, including both in-the-cloud, stand-alone and Apache server embedded deployments. The ModSecurity rules language will be covered and several ModSecurity Core Rules that are representative of its capabilities will be dissected in depth. Finally, some interesting uses of ModSecurity's content injection capabilities will be discussed. Anyone up for hacking the hacker via scripting injected into your webapp's response to an attempted attack? This talk will show you how!

Proper network infrastructure configuration is a crucial step in a successful defense in depth strategy for any organization. The fact that the network fabric is susceptible to these attacks years after their initial discovery is alarming and disgusting at the same time. We propose to revisit these attacks using contemporary techniques and tools and also offer equally contemporary solutions to mitigate or foil these malicious networks attacks as the case may be. Networking professionals will be able to walk away from this presentation with solid remedies to these issues with a reinforcement that they actually still exist and are pertinent to a network security strategy that will function now and in the future.

### Virtually Hacking

##### John Fitzpatrick

 *Information Security Consultant - MWR InfoSecurity*

Own the VMware box and you get half the servers on the network for free. Although, depending on the VMware server's configuration, whether you want to be stealthy about it and whether you want to avoid any disruption it may not always be quite that simple. During this talk we will take a look at ways of jumping from a server to guest OS without causing any disruption and also some tools for assessing the security posture of VMware products.

With VMware becoming an integral part of many networks it is important that the security level of its deployment is assessed appropriately. Without the right tools to do the job this can be a slow and painful task; with the right tools you can have a lot of fun. I'll demo some tools which I have been working on that harness the power of dradis and make testing and possibly owning VMware servers and VMs a virtually painless task.

**John Fitzpatrick** is an information security consultant working in the UK for MWR InfoSecurity performing penetration and application tests. His primary interests are in searching for security issues in anything that might make a network a playground and in writing code that does fun things. John is always researching some protocol, software or technology, generally with the goal of breaking it or finding a new interesting attack vector; most recently this research has been targeted towards VMWare. He is also highly experienced in a technique which enables him to code all night and still turn up to work in the mornings.

### Is that a unique credential in your pocket or are you just pleased to see me?

##### Zac Franken

 *Security Researcher*

This year **new shiny toys** are abound, as I'll tell you about the credentials in your wallet, and even in you. How secure (or not) they are and a few ways to duplicate / replicate /emulate them.

Last year at Defcon 15 I had a bit of a chat with you guys and gave you an overview of access control systems, told you of their common flaw, and showed you some cool toys that exploit it. This year, from the humble magnetic stripe card to the modern hand geometry scanner, I will take you through some simple (and not so simple) ways to get in, so you can try and keep **them** out.

**Physical access control systems are shockingly vulnerable**. As far as I am concerned most have the security equivalence of a "Please keep off the grass" sign.

Take that "Please keep off the grass" sign, add poor implementation, bad products, and a security industry that charges extra for any security whatsoever, poor locks that are pickable/bumpable, add accountants that nickel and dime their organization's security budget (because it doesn't have to be secure, it just has to enable them to tick a box in their corporate filings), and you end up with a sign that says "eep ass" which only delays an intruder in as much, as they briefly stop to ponder WTF you meant by the sign in the first place.

Why are you here? Why aren't you at home on the porch with a shotgun protecting your property?!

Wait a minute...... Why am I here?!

 *Security Researcher*

If you were to "hack the planet" how many hosts do you think you could compromise through a single vulnerable application technology? A million? A hundred-million? A billion? What kind of application is so ubiquitous that it would enable someone to launch a planet-wide attack? - why, the Web browser of course! We've all seen and studied one side of the problem - the mass- defacements and iframe injections. But how many vulnerable Web browsers are really out there? How fast are they being patched? Who's winning the patching race? Who's the tortoise and who's the hare? Our latest global study of Web browser use (tapping in to Google's massive data repositories) has revealed some startling answers along with a new perspective on just how easy it would be to "hack the planet" if you really felt like it.

### Journey to the center of the HP28

##### Travis Goodspeed

 *Security Researcher*

In 1990, a wire-bound book was published in Paris by the title of <<Voyage au centre de la HP28 c/s>>. It presents a very thorough account of the inner workings of the Hewlett Packard 28 series of graphing calculators. Designed before the days of prepackaged microprocessors, the series uses the Saturn architecture, which HP designed in-house. This architecture is very different from today's homogeneous RISC chips, with registers of 1, 4, 12, 16, 20, and 64 bits in width. The fundamental unit of addressing is the nibble, rather than the byte. Floats are represented as binary-coded decimal, and a fundamental object in the operating system is an algebraic expression.

This architecture is still used, albeit in emulation, in the modern HP50g. With this talk, I intend to call attention to a fascinating, professional, and well-documented feat of reverse engineering. Using little more than their ingenuity and an Apple ][e, Paul Courbis and Sebastien Lalande reverse engineered a black box calculator into a real computer, one which became user-programmable in machine language as a result. More than that, they documented the hack in such exquisite detail that their book is not just a fascinating read, but also veritable holy scripture for anyone trying to write custom software for this machine.

Expect a thorough review, in English, of the contents of the book. This is not a sales pitch; electronic copies of both the translation and the original are free to all interested readers. Topics include the datatypes of the computer algebra system, hacking an upgrade into the memory bus, bootstrapping an assembler, writing in machine language by tables, and adding an I/O port for software backups.

**Travis Goodspeed** works at the Extreme Measurement Communications Center of the DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He has spoken at ToorCon 9 and the Texas Instruments Developer's Conference regarding stack overflow exploits for the MSP430-based Wireless Sensor Networks. Having demonstrated that such attacks are possible, his present research is aimed at porting defense techniques, such as ASLR and code-auditing, to this platform. For the past year, he has been translating <<Voyage au centre de la HP28 c/s>>, a fascinating work of francophone reverse engineering, into English.

### Making the DEFCON 16 Badge

##### Joe "Kingpin" Grand

For the third year in a row, Kingpin has had the honor of designing the DEFCON Badge. No longer just a boring piece of passive material, the badge is now a full-featured, active electronic product. If you're up early enough and interested in details of the entire development process of the badge, from initial concept drawings to prototype electronics to completed units, and want to hear stories of the trials and tribulations that come with designing and manufacturing, be sure to come to this talk.

**Joe "Kingpin" Grand** Kingpin is an electrical engineer, hardware hacker, and former member of L0pht Heavy Industries. Even with his distrust of big business, he has become a co-host of an upcoming engineering build show, Prototype This, for Discovery Channel. Sometimes he uses his real name, Joe Grand, and invents things for his company, Grand Idea Studio (www.grandideastudio.com). He's also the sole proprietor of Kingpin Empire, a hacker-inspired merchandise outfit (www.kingpinempire.com) that gives back to the community through charitable donations. He's designed the badge for DEFCON a few times, too.

### BSODomizer

##### Joe "Kingpin" Grand

##### Zoz

 *Robotics Engineer*

We like hardware and we like messing with people. BSODomizer lets us do both. BSODomizer is a small propeller-based electronic device that interfaces between a VGA output device (laptop or desktop) and VGA monitor and will flash images at random time intervals. (Surprise Goatse!) Or display your favorite BSOD causing the confused user to turn off their machine over and over again. Customization for different modes are configurable via on-board DIP switches.

We'll bring you through the entire design and development process of the device and end with some never-before-seen footage of poor bastards taking the bait. Full schematics, firmware, circuit board layout, and bill of materials will be released, so you can build your own BSODomizer. We'll have some bare PCB's and parts available for your instant gratification.

Don't let the name fool you. BSODomizer will do everything you've always wanted to do to your enemies (or friends) without the messy cleanup.

**Zoz** is a robotics engineer, software hacker, pyrochemist and inveterate tinkerer. He got his PhD from the MIT Media Lab primarily so he could say "Trust me, I'm a doctor". After years in academia his love of media whoring could be held back no longer, so he is presently engaged in selling out by co-hosting Prototype This! for the Discovery Channel. He invents things for his own amusement, giving them designations like Funkenschnorkel, Luftwerfer and Schallfaust, and rarely associates his real name with anything.

### Nail the Coffin Shut, NTLM is Dead

##### Kurt Grutzmacher

 *Security Researcher*

Ever since SirDystic's SMBRelay release the weaknesses of the NTLM protocol have been repeatedly shown. For over twenty years this protocol has been refined by Microsoft, it's time to let it go and stop supporting it within our networks.

This presentation will trace the history of the NTLM protocol and the various attacks that have befallen it over the past decade, the attempts at fixing them and why these fixes have not succeeded. I will show what I believe is the most significant attack to it and why the best solution is to migrate away from NTLM once and for all. Attendees will come away with a stronger understanding of the NTLM protocol and information to help them make the case to their Windows administrators, CIOs, CSOs and everybody else that there is a serious risk in keeping NTLM support around. A toolkit using the Metasploit Framework will be released that will help you show the risks in your enterprise.

**Kurt Grutzmacher** is a CISSP, but don't hold that against him. Lots of us have it because it keeps us employed. He was employed by the Federal Reserve System for 15 years, 5 of those in the official capacity of performing penetration tests and security reviews. Currently he works at Pacific Gas & Electric, one of the largest public utilities in the United States. Kurt has provided updates to the Metasploit Framework directly related to LM/NTLM support.

### Satan is on my Friends list: Attacking Social Networks

##### Nathan Hamiel

 *Senior Consultant, Idea Information Security*
##### Shawn Moyer

 *CTO, Agura Digital Security*

Social Networking is shaping up to be the perfect storm... An implicit trust of those in one's network or social circle, a willingness to share information, little or no validation of identity, the ability to run arbitrary code (in the case of user-created apps) with minimal review, and a tag soup of client-side user-generated HTML (Hello? MySpace? 1998 called. It wants its markup vulns back). Yikes.

But enough about pwning the kid from homeroom who copied your calc homework. With the rise of business social networking sites, there are now thousands of public profiles with real names and titles of people working for major banks, the defense and aerospace industry, federal agencies, the US Senate... A target-rich and trusting environment for custom-tailored, laser-focused attacks.

Our talk will show the results of a series of public experiments aimed at pointing out the security and privacy ramifications of everyone's increasingly open, increasingly connected online personae and the interesting new attack vectors they've created.

Plus, we get to have some fun violating scads of EULAs, AUPs, and Terms of Service along the way.

### Advanced Software Armoring and Polymorphic Kung Fu

##### Nick Harbour

 *Principal Consultant, Mandiant*

This presentation discusses the techniques employed by a new anti-reverse engineering tool named PE-Scrambler. Unlike a traditional executable packer which simply compresses or encrypts the original executable, this tool has the ability to permanently modify the compiled code itself. With the ability to modify compiled programs at the instruction level a vast array of Anti-Reverse Engineering techniques are possible that would traditionally have been performed only by hand by seasoned hackers. In addition to thwarting a would-be reverse engineer, the tool has the ability to randomly modify code in a program in a fashion that keeps the functionality of the program in-tact. This is useful for modifying a program to defeat signature recognition algorithms such as those used in Anti-Virus programs. In this presentation we will discuss several of these Anti-Reverse Engineering and Polymorphic techniques in depth. A new technique and tool for detecting armored and packed binaries will also be discussed and demonstrated.

In addition to learning about two new security tools, attendees will learn state-of-the-art anti-disassembly and anti debugging techniques. Attendees' eyes will be opened to the vast world of possibility that lies in the future for binary armoring and develop a true contempt for the binary packers of today.

**Nick Harbour** is a Principal Consultant with Mandiant. He specializes in Malware Analysis and Incident Response as well as both offensive and defensive research and development. He also occasionally teaches malware analysis and reverse engineering. Nick's nine year history in the security industry began as a researcher and forensic examiner at the DoD Computer Forensics Lab (DCFL) where he helped pioneer the field of computer forensics. Nick is a developer of open source software including most notably dcfldd, the popular forensic disk imaging tool, tcpxtract, a tool for carving files out of network traffic and Mandiant Red Curtain, a tool for identifying malicious binaries. Nick is also a trained chef!

### A Hacker Looks at 50

##### G. Mark Hardy

 *Founder, National Security Corporation*

Take a trip back in time and discover what hacking was like in the pioneer days -- before the Internet, the PC, or even the Commodore 64 or TRS-80. The speaker started "exploring" computer systems in 1973, when the only law about hacking was the hacker ethic itself. Join a humorous reminiscence about what it was like building an Altair 8800, "discovering" the 2600 Hz tone, storing programs on punched cards, cracking bad crypto, and more. You'll find the people and principles haven't changed, only the speed of the hardware.

**G. Mark Hardy** CISSP, CISM, CISA, founded National Security Corporation in 1988. Since his first legitimate computer security job in 1976 for $2.10/hour, he has presented several hundred talks on information security.

### Playing with Web Application Firewalls

##### Wendel Guglielmetti Henrique

 *Penetration Test Analyst - Intruders Tiger Team Security*

WAF (Web Application Firewalls) are often called 'Deep Packet Inspection Firewalls' because they look at every request and response within the HTTP/HTTPS/SOAP/XML-RPC/Web Service layers. Some WAFs look for certain 'attack signatures' to try to identify a specific attack that an intruder may be sending, while others look for abnormal behavior that doesn't fit the websites normal traffic patterns. Web Application Firewalls can be either software, or hardware appliance based and are installed in front of a webserver in an effort to try and shield it from incoming attacks.

Today WAF systems are considered the next generation product to protect websites against web hacking attacks, this presentation will show some techniques to detect, fingerprint and evade them. Affiliated to Hackaholic team (http://hackaholic.org/) and working as penetration tester to a Brazilian company called SecurityLabs in the Intruders Tiger Team division - One of leaders company of segment in Brazil, among our clients are government, credit card industry, etc.

**Wendel Guglielmetti Henrique** has worked with IT since 1997, during the last 7 years he has worked in the computer security field.

### War Ballooning-Kismet Wireless "Eye in the Sky"

##### Rick Hill

 *Senior Scientist, Tenacity Solutions, Inc.*

Using a Balloon as an aerial network surveillance platform, a.k.a. "WarBallooning" is an idea that evolved as a natural progression out of my Rocket-based experiment @ Defcon 14 entitled, "WarRocketing - Network Stumbling 50 sq. miles in < 60 seconds."

Interestingly, after my presentation in 2006, many in the wireless community discussed Balloon-based network discovery, notably CoWF & Slashdot. But, alas, like many great concepts in the scientific community, I found after much research (2008) that sadly to my (& Google's) knowledge no one has yet demonstrated WarBallooning ... Until Today!

My team, (with the help of CoWF and DEFCON support staff) will demonstrate WarBallooning @Defcon 16 over the Riviera Hotel. Wardriving coverage is limited by obstructions such as trees, houses, and terrain. Our latest aerial platform, (a 6 ft. Helium Balloon) does not have these limitations. Essentially, it was built to provide a superior Line-of-Sight, enabling the Wardriver to rapidly recon. a fairly large urban area.

Most Notable Feature: The Kismet "Eye in the Sky" actually beams live video back as the antenna targets various buildings (& networks.)

The presentation will include details of all hardware hacks involved in the construction: WRT54G, Alchemy, Kismet Drone, & IP camera modifications. No prerequisite - only an interest in Network Stumbling and Wireless Technology.

**Rick Hill** CISSP, works as an information security engineer for Tenacity Solutions, an IT consulting firm based in Reston, VA. Specializing in Wireless Security, his consulting gig involves C&A of govt. networks, site surveys, and performing network security assessments. Outside the day job, Rick enjoys boating, downhill
skiing, and is an avid top-fuel drag racing fan... The speed fetish and love of technical hardware lead naturally to his 2 favorite hobbies: High Power Rocketry & Netstumbling. (You may recall the "WarRocketing" talk that he presented two years ago @DEFCON 14). Since that time: Rick's acquired much more professional netstumbling time, built several cool wireless devices, and now mixes his own rocket fuel. He's attending DEFCON 16 to check out the Wireless Village and to give a talk about his newest flying & hardware hacking adventure.

### Race-2-Zero Unpacked

##### Simon Howard

 *Founder, Mince Research*

Signaure-based Antivirus is dead, we want to show you just how dead it is. This presentation will detail our findings from running the Race-2-Zero contest during DC16. The contest involves teams or individuals being given a sample set of malicious programs to modify and upload through the contest portal. The portal passes the modified samples through a number of antivirus engines and determines if the sample is a known threat. The first to pass their sample past all antivirus engines undetected wins that round. Each round increases in complexity as the contest progresses.

Topics covered will include:

* An overview of the multi-AV engine interface
* Mutation / obfuscation techniques
* Statistical analysis of the time taken to circumvent various products
* Different approaches used by contestants
* Were viruses or exploits easier to obfuscate?

Prize giving ceremony with celeb judging panel... prizes will be awarded for

##### The loss of anonymity and other dangers of the cash free society

##### Tony Howlett

 *President, Network Security Services*

In this talk, we will discuss the pros and cons (mostly cons) of the cash less society and how it might endanger your privacy and civil liberties. This movement towards the elimination of cash has been picking up speed and mostly accepted by the populace as a huge convenience. We examine some reasons why this isn't such a good thing. We also look at legislation and laws in this area that give banks and the government unprecedented ability to track your financial transactions, cash and non with little or no cause. And finally some ways to avoid this scrutiny and protect your financial privacy.

### Stealing The Internet - A Routed, Wide-area, Man in the Middle Attack

##### Anton Kapela

*Security Researcher*
##### Alex Pilosov

*Security Researcher*

In this presentation we're going to show Defcon how broken the Internet is, how helpless its users are without provider intervention, and how much apathy there is towards routing security.

With the method described in this talk, an attacker is able to gain full control and visibility of all IP packets heading towards an arbitrary destination prefix on the Internet. From the perspective of the victims network, every inbound packet they receive will have first taken the 'scenic route' through the attackers network before getting reaching the true destination.

The presentation will show attendees how (roughly) BGP works on the Internet, how and what providers do (or don't do) when interconnecting their networks, concluding with a discussion of the hijacking method and a live demo of 'man in the middled' traffic, in-flight, to an undisclosed destination, including countermeasures employed to further obscure the interception and ensure nearly perfect network transparency.
Ettercap and others please stand aside - routed Internet hijacking has come of age!

**Tkap (xam) & Pilo** have presented at Defcon in the
past but never before with this much spit & vinegar. Tkap usually talks about layer-1 and 2 stuff, like microwaves and data transport technologies. Pilo usually talks about optical transport systems and
other layer-1 technologies, but he likes routing security too!

### Demonstration of Hardware Trojans

##### Fouad Kiamilev

 *Professor, Electrical & Computer Engineering Dept., University of Delaware*
##### Ryan Hoover

 *Graduate Student*

Recent developments such as the FBI operation "Cisco Raider" that resulted in the discovery of 3,500 counterfeit Cisco network components show the growing concern of U.S. government about an electronic hardware equivalent of a "Trojan horse". In an electronic Trojan attack, extra circuitry is illicitly added to hardware during its manufacture. When triggered, the hardware Trojan performs an illicit action such as leaking secret information, allowing attackers clandestine access or control, or disabling or reducing functionality of the device. The growing use of programmable hardware devices (such as FPGAs) coupled with the increasing push to manufacture most electronic devices overseas means that our hardware is increasingly vulnerable to a Trojan attack from potential enemies.

This talk explores three possible methods that a hardware Trojan can use to leak secret information to the outside world: thermal, optical and radio. The hardware platform for our demonstration is a $149 Spartan-3E Starter Kit from XILINX. The application used in our demonstration is AES encryption. The objective of our Trojan is to illicitly leak the AES encryption keys once triggered.

In the thermal Trojan demo, we use an infrared camera to show how electronic components or exposed connector pins can be used to transmit illicit information thermally. In the optical Trojan demo, we use an optical-to-audio converter to show how a power-on LED can be used to transmit illicit information using signal frequencies undetectable by human eyes. Finally, in the radio Trojan demo, we use a radio receiver to show how an external connector can be used to transmit illicit information using AM radio transmission.

We finish our talk with a demonstration of an optical Trojan that leaks the encryption keys from a popular commercial network router (e.g. Cisco-Linksys WRT54GS).

**Fouad Kiamilev** is a professor in the Department Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Delaware where he directs a group of pirates who call themselves CVORG (which stands for CMOS VLSI Optimization Research Group).

### WhiteSpace: A Different Approach to JavaScript Obfuscation

##### Kolisar

 *Security Researcher*

A different approach to JavaScript obfuscation will be presented. There are certain telltale indicators within an obfuscated JavaScript file which can be used for detection and protection. These signs occur in almost all obfuscated JavaScript and are easily detected via software and visual inspection. This different approach addresses these telltale indicators and provides a method of JavaScript obfuscation which hides these indicators from both automated and visual inspection.

**Kolisar** began writing software at the age of 10. His first computer was a Commodore Vic-20 with a whopping 3K or RAM. After high school and attending a technical school he spent nearly 20 years as a software engineer writing CAM tools on UNIX and Windows, machine control and CRM software in C/C++, Java, JavaScript, VBScript, etc., and occasionally hand optimizing assembly graphics code for performance. He is currently working in the security department of a medium-sized company where he does security research, vulnerability and risk assessment, incident response and reverse engineering malware.

### Taking Back your Cellphone

##### Alexander Lash

 *Security Researcher*

This presentation will cover a variety of topics of interest to anyone on a cellphone network in the US. I'm going to cover how to use your own backends for MMS and WAP access, unlock Bluetooth tethering, and circumvent some of the more obnoxious carrier restrictions.

Of course, the best part is baking your own firmware and running your own code. I'll provide an overview of the processes necessary to do so, a quick rundown of what you can expect from your carrier, a few tools and docs I've assembled to take a little pain out of the process, and all of the information you'll need to void your warranty with gusto and panache.

I'll provide several demonstrations you can follow along with on your own phone. The more restricted your phone is, the more mileage you'll get out of this talk --- and one lucky audience member will have their warranty voided live!

**Alexander Lash**  has been tampering with cellular phones for ten years and putting together mobile applications for four. He's been putting together tools and docs while taking apart firmware and carrier systems, and takes personal offense at the idea of not being able to write code for his own hardware. (Pay no attention to the fact that he's left a trail of dead phones in his wake.)

### Developments in Cisco IOS Forensics

##### "FX" Felix Lindner

 *Head of Recurity Labs*

Attacks on network infrastructure are not a new field. However, the increasing default protections in common operating systems, platforms and development environments increase interest in the less protected infrastructure sector. Today, performing in-depth crash analysis or digital forensics is almost impossible on the most widely used routing platform.

This talk will show new developments in this sector and how a slightly adjusted network infrastructure configuration together with new tools finally allows to separate crashed, attacked and backdoored routers from each other. We walk through the known types of backdoors and shellcodes for IOS as well as their detection and the challenges in doing so.

### Toying with Barcodes

##### "FX" Felix Lindner

 *Head of Recurity Labs*

The talk focuses on 1D and 2D barcode applications with interference possibilities for the ordinary citizen. Ever wondered what is in these blocks of squares on postal packages, letters and tickets? Playing with them might have interesting effects, reaching from good old fun to theft and severe impact.

Barcodes have been around for ages, but most of the time were used as simple tags with a number. The rise of 2D barcodes started to put them into customer hands as authentication, authorization, payment method and other arbitrary data transport. The implicit trust in them is enormous. The talk gives a very quick intro into barcodes and then proceeds to review the contents of selected samples, including their usage in the real world. This is going to be fun, tool release included.

### Malware RCE: Debuggers and Decryptor Development

##### Michael Ligh

 *Security Intelligence Engineer, iDEFENSE*
##### Greg Sinclair

 *Rapid Response Engineer, VeriSign iDefense Rapid Response*

This talk will focus on using a debugger to reverse engineer malware, with an emphasis on building decryption tools for credential recovery and command/control (c&c) inspection. Most modern-day trojans exhibit cryptography, or just home-grown obfuscation techniques, to prevent analysis of the stolen data or c&c protocol. This presentation will show how to script the debugger such that it leverages the trojan's own internal functions to decrypt information of the researcher's choice. The concepts will be demonstrated using current threats such as Feebs, Silent Banker, CoreFlood, Torpig/MBR, Kraken, Prg/Zues, and Laqma.

**Michael Hale Ligh** is currently a security intelligence engineer at Verisign iDefense. He specializes in reverse engineering malware to provide in-depth analysis on capabilities, techniques, and decryption services. In the past, Michael obtained his masters in forensic computer investigation in 2004 and began providing Internet security services to financial institutions. He then gained interest in vulnerability research and has been credited with locating critical flaws in products such as Tumbleweed MailGate, Novell iMonitor/eDirectory, Symark PowerBroker, and F5 FirePass SSL VPN. Michael is a member of ZERT and has submitted winning entries in several malware related contests/challenges (SANS malware analysis, honeynet.org scan-of-the-month, and hacker challenge 2007). More of Michael's research is available online at www.mnin.org.

**Greg Sinclair** is a member of the Rapid Response Team that provides quick analysis and remediation techniques for malcode threats. Before joining Verisign, he worked for two years as a risk assessment security engineer for Healthcare Services Corporation (HCSC) in Chicago.

### Tuning Your Brain

##### Lyn

I can't tell you how often I'm listening to trance, goa or industrial when I'm coding. Often when we're stuck in a black hole, or just can't figure the problem out - the right music will help. Why does this work? It seems motivating, and it seems like we solve problems easier, and it seems to create a flow. Turns out, your brain is like a tuning fork. This talk will include a bit of biology - going over the basics of the brain structures, neurons, synapses and neurotransmitters, before getting to how music affects the brain, and how it helps us think.

**Lyn** is a web developer with a lot of time on her hands apparently. Her last EE experience was in the 5th grade, soldering boards for a $5 allowance. Oh, and she once was a research assistant and spent a lot of time attaching electrodes and preparing study participants for an EEG. Neurology has been her hobby since then.

### Feed my Sat Monkey

##### Major Malfunction

In this confused rant^W^W talk, I will explain why the little green men are right, and also know how to party. I will show you some new toys. Shiny ones. Ones that go 'beep' and have flashy lights. You will like it, and I will be able to return to my home planet, mission accomplished, to the adulation of the triple-breasted masses and the reward of a grateful nation, followed by tea, medals and an inadequate state pension. Or I'll go to jail, whichever's quicker and/or cheaper.

OK, so you've sated your almost bottomless appetite for pr0n, obscure sports, late night poker and reality TV from countries you've never heard of and hopefully will never have to visit, so what else is there to do? What else is up there? (Apart from little green men, obviously... which are completely real, BTW... You should see some of the stuff we've got over in... oh, wait... I'm not supposed to talk about that... ) Where was I? Oh, yes... so I've got about a gazillion channels on a trillion satellites all bobbing about above me in space, but what are they all doing? How can I find anything interesting amongst all that background noise? Enough with the pr0n already! I want to see something cool! I want something nobody else is getting! I want what THE MAN's got!!! I want to be able to say to my friends "It just comes to you... This stuff just flies through the air... They send this information out - it's just beamed out all over the fuckin' place... All you have to do is know how to grab it... See, I know how to grab it.". And stuff like that. Yeah, baby. That would be HOT!

I'll also talk about something else. Something that'll probably get me whacked. So let's not talk about it yet, eh?

Miss Moneypenny says that Major's been a very naughty boy and can't come out to play today. Instead, he'll stay after skewl and write a thousand times ""I am not a Secret Agent in the employ of Her Majesty's Secret Service, I do not take tea with Little Green Men, and my cover name is not Adam Laurie"". His travels to security conferences around the world will be suspended until further notice, and Governments, Police, Military, Big Business, Little Business and Little Boys will no longer pay attention to his (strange) advice. When he claims to have a Secret Nuclear Bunker, his tuck will be confiscated and he will be sent to Matron for 'Special Treatment' (and we all know what THAT means, don't we? Yes, Matron). Now, heads down and get back to work, and no talking at the back there! I SAW that, Gates minor! Report to me after class..."

### Fear, Uncertainty and the Digital Armageddon

##### Morgan Marquis-Boire

 *Principal Consultant, Security-Assessment.com*

We now live in an age where attacks on critical infrastructure will cause real world harm. An increasing global concern regarding cyber-terrorism reflects the problem critical infrastructure security poses for many large IT consulting companies, telecommunications providers, utilities and industrial companies.

SCADA networks are the foundation of the infrastructure which makes everyday life possible in most first world countries. This talk will provide an introduction to critical infrastructure environments and SCADA networks and the major differences that exist between understood security best practice and the protective measures regularly found (or not) in these networks.

The most common security mistakes will be covered, as will real world examples taken from penetration testing SCADA environments. Additionally, this talk will expose some of the potentially catastrophic consequences of a failure in a production SCADA environment. There will be an examination of the critical infrastructure hysteria which is currently in vogue and some consideration of steps which can be taken to secure these networks and prevent cyber-terrorism.

**Morgan Marquis-Boire** is a Principal Security Consultant at Security-Assessment.com where he specializes in Unix, forensics, and network security. He has a degree in philosophy and enjoys big kit and forgotten networks. Prior to his present incarnation as a corporate security guy, he's worked doing cluster computing, government infrastructure, Linux security appliances, and a security start-up in Japan.

### Sniffing Cable Modems

##### Guy Martin

 *Security Researcher*

Cable modems are widely used these days for internet connections or other applications. This talk gives a detailed overview of this mean of communication with a focus on its security.

DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is currently the most used protocol around the world for providing internet over TV coaxial cable. Due to its nature, this protocol can easily be sniffed by taping onto the TV cable using a digital TV card. By doing this, you can not only sniff your own connection but all the connections of the entire neighborhood. With my tool packet-o-matic and an inexpensive DVB-C card, countless things are possible ranging from dumping people's email into maildir to removing firewall rules and quota limitation on your connection or even a DoS of all HTTP communications by injecting TCP reset packets.

**Guy Martin** is an active open source developer interested in all technologies that comes to his hands. After porting Gentoo Linux on the HPPA architecture five years ago, he's now primarily focused on writing a new kind of sniffer, packet-o-matic.

### Bringing Sexy Back: Breaking in with Style

##### David Maynor

 *CTO, Errata Security*
##### Robert Graham

 *CTO, Errata Security*

Security is getting better; there is no doubt about that. High value targets are increasing their security while buying into the buzzword hype with phrases like "defense in depth". Firewalls, IPS, AV, NAC, and a host of other technologies have done a lot to give the pointy hair bosses of the world the ability to sleep easy...or has it. While those PHB sleep easy in their bed the ability to compromise a site at will continues to grow.

Remember the good old days of planting Trojans in microcontrollers of your enemy's hardware or shipping packages with system updates that contain backdoors? What happened to those days? What if I told you that breaking into a site is as easy as sending a package via some third party carrier or throwing up a website. This talk will cover penetration techniques that at first glance appear to be Hollywood fiction but are easy and reliable methods of intrusion.

Miss this talk and you may never know why you have a package in your shipping department addressed to "U R Owned, INC.".

**David Maynor** is a founder of Errata Security and serves as the Chief Technical Officer. Mr. Maynor is responsible for day-to-day technical decisions of Errata Security and also employs a strong background in reverse engineering and exploit development to produce Hacker Eye View reports.

### Forensics is ONLY for Private Investigators

##### Scott Moulton

 *President of Forensic Strategy Services, LLC*

If the only requirement for you to become a Computer Forensic person is to be a Private Investigator, why would you ever take a certification again? You would never need to be a CCE (computer certified examiner), nor any other certification of any kind. You would be one of the only people in your area that could legally do the job and why spend a single dime you don't have to? These new laws will destroy certifications and qualifications as we know it, and we will be pushed out of our own industry!

I was the one of the first experts to be challenged on the new Private Investigator laws while on the stand testify in a criminal case in 2006. This is the bill that actually passed in 2006 a week before I took the stand and was challenged by state prosecution. It simply states that doing any kind of 'digital investigation' without a PI license is a felony.

http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2005\_06/fulltext/hb1259.htm

When they passed the law in March of 2006 they intended for it to go into effect on July 1st, 2006 with no grandfather clause. Since it takes 2 years to become a PI in the state of Georgia, immediately everyone that was a third party practicing forensics would be a felony.

In Georgia it is a 2 year apprenticeship, then a test and a pile of money and insurance (PI's have to have 2 million in EandO) and then 40 hours of continuing education a year specifically on PI topics in certified classes. Currently I do not know of any on computer forensics that qualify for the PI continuing education. The inclusion of computer forensics in the PI license does not change a single item for the existing PI tests, knowledge base, or requirements. A security guard would be able to do a computer forensic job legally where the CISSP could not.

Since this time, my company has become a Private Investigation company and I have a Private Investigator License. This is a talk about the struggles of becoming a PI and what the laws are for computer forensics going forward. Everyone that does computer security for any legal purpose, or computer forensics as a third party stands to lose as these laws are being passed all over the United States. In the future it may be impossible for "you" to go out on your own doing any kind of "DIGITAL" security or forensic work limiting your future forever!

I hope that everyone who never pays any attention to legislation and their own laws, spends a little time reviewing the laws they are trying to slip in without your even knowing it is coming. There is a great ignorance amongst computer security and computer forensic people that just disbelieves this can even happen. However a few states like Texas have already made this a law and it is affecting the industry now and causing quite a few well know computer forensic people to walk away from jobs. I hope everyone listens and gets involved and joins together this fragmented society of computer security and forensic people into one voice that makes the states take notice that we will not standby and let government make our choices for our future!

If you are in a computer forensic job or collect any kind of digital evidence for any legal purpose you might want to be aware of what is about to happen to your jobs! Now is the time to get knowledgeable about this topic and do what you can to prevent it from becoming the requirement for you to have a job. Computers Forensics/Security and Private Investigations are so different that many people will never believe that is what will enable you to be able to do your job. This will destroy certifications as we know it for many digital fields.

**Scott Moulton** Scott Moulton began his forensic computer career with a specialty in rebuilding hard drives for investigation purposes and has rebuilt hard drives for several cases including murder investigations, corporate fraud, civil defense and criminal defense.

Scott was the first person arrested for Port Scanning and won his case back in 2000 when the judge declared Port scans legal. Scott has also been fighting against computer forensic people and computer security people having to become private investigators for which laws are being passed in each state making it a felony to do any kind of 'digital investigation' without a PI License.

Scott has spent more than a year digging into repairing Solid State Hard Drives and understands the ins and outs and how it will affect recovery and forensics in the future. Many forensic jobs will change due to fact that some information will not be accessible in the future.

### Solid State Drives Destroy Forensic & Data Recovery Jobs: Animated!

##### Scott Moulton

 *President of Forensic Strategy Services, LLC*

This speech is all ANIMATION in 3D! Data on a Solid State Device is virtualized and the Physical Sector that you are asking for is not actually the sector it was 5 minutes ago. The data moves around using wear leveling schemes controlled by the drive using propriety methods. When you ask for Sector 125, its physical address block is converted to an LBA block and every 5 write cycles the data is moved to a new and empty previously erased block. This destroys metadata used in forensics & data recovery. File Slack Space disappears, you can no longer be sure that the exact physical sector you are recovering was in the same location or has not been moved or find out what it used to be!

I will explain how Flash and Solid State Drives are different and compare them to hard drives in their ability to read and write data. What happens when they are damaged and a recovery needs to be done? In this process you will see how the data gets shuffled around and how some of the data is destroyed in the process making it impossible in many cases to recover some files and metadata that on a hard drive has been a simple task by comparison. You will also get an idea about how propriety methods that each vendor is using will isolate you from knowing what is happening to your data or even where it is on the drive. And at the very least the animation is the quality of the History Channel and you will enjoy what you are learning!

**Scott Moulton** Scott Moulton began his forensic computer career with a specialty in rebuilding hard drives for investigation purposes and has rebuilt hard drives for several cases including murder investigations, corporate fraud, civil defense and criminal defense.

### Beholder: New wifi monitor tool

##### Nelson Murilo

 *Security Researcher*
##### Luiz 'effffn' Eduardo

 *Security Researcher*

Although it's not something new at all, network administrators are still facing (and having to deal) with old problems and threats. One of these problems is to be able to detect rogue and/or fake access points in their networks and surroundings. The current solutions available are mostly commercial and/or proprietary, but we haven't seen yet any open-source tool that implements specifically WIDS capabilities. We would like to introduce to DefCon: Beholder. The talk will include a brief introduction on the general state of the commercial WIDS tools and evolution of wireless attacks, and will be mostly focused on the Beholder project. Beholder is an C language opensource tool available (for now) for linux platforms, and it can be used for any available 802.11 technology a nic card may support, and it isn't driver dependent, run in all available linux wifi drivers. The tool does some, of course, some basic network scanning, but also implements some simple (but cool) stuff, that some of the commercial tools don't have. The presentation will cover details about that tool, future features, scenarios to be implemented, examples, and a demo (yep, demo at DefCon) of malicious AP/tools in action and how beholder can be used to detect it.

**Nelson Murilo** has been a Network Security Analyst since 1992. He is the author of two network security books in Portuguese, regular contributor of the Brazilian Computer Emergency Response Team security guides and technical papers and a regular speaker at security conferences in Brazil and abroad. Nelson is the author and co-author of open source security tools such as:

\* chkrootkit - locally checks for the presence of a rootkit

\* Btsearch - tool developed to find bluetooth hidden devices

**Luiz 'effffn' Eduardo** has over 15 years of experience working with network security, and, for the past 6 years has been mostly dedicated to wireless security, protocol fuzzing and computer incident response. He is somewhat known in the scene for planning, implementing and supporting wireless networks in security conferences, like DefCon, BlackHat, Computer Chaos Congress, Shmoocon, Layerone, etc. He's one of DefCon networking team goons and has spoken previously at
Shmoocon, DefCon, Toorcon, Hack in the Box Malaysia and other cons. Luiz currently holds the following certifications: CISSP, CWNE, CEH, GCIH and GISP, and has probably being able to get them due to long flights around the globe and flight delays in airports (thanks, United!)

Both Nelson and Luiz are some of the organizers of the conference: you sh0t the sheriff, which takes place in in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

### Good Viruses. Evaluating the Risks

##### Dr. Igor Muttik

 *Sr. Architect McAfee Avert Labs*

This session will discuss the risks associated with creation of replicating code. A combination of wide availability of virus source code as well as the problem of control over replicating code make these experiments quite risky. To demonstrate these points we shall see how a computer virus was once created unintentionally in a self-modifying tool called ALREADY.COM (we'll disassemble and debug it). We shall watch a video of the "Corrupted blood" epidemic in World of Warcraft when a virtual "good" virus got out of control. We will examine "beneficial" properties of W32/Nachi worm and discuss pros and cons of harnessing replication for patching vulnerabilities.

**Dr. Igor Muttik** graduated from Moscow State University in 1985. His Ph.D. in 1989 was based on the research of semi- and super-conductors. He became interested in computer viruses in 1987 when PCs in the lab were infected with Cascade.

In 1995 he joined Dr.Solomon's Software in the UK as a Virus Researcher. In 1999 he headed Avert in Europe and now is Senior Avert Labs Architect. He speaks regularly at security conferences.

### Brain Games:

##### Make your own Biofeedback Video Game

##### Ne0nRa1n

##### Joe "Kingpin" Grand

 *Founder, Grand Idea Studios*

More and more scientific studies are weighing in on video games and their positive benefits. The dated idea of video games being damaging to one's health and a waste of time is slowly being replaced with the idea of video games as high-tech therapy. By incorporating sensors to measure the player's physiological state, game play performance can be affected or altered.
Among the various types of biofeedback, heart rate variability is one of the easiest to understand and build hardware for. In this presentation, not only will we guide you through how to construct simple hardware to read your own heart rate and provide you with some open-source code as a starting point for your future favorite biofeedback game designs, we will also use a real-live human volunteer from the audience to demonstrate the technology!

**Ne0nRa1n** a veteran DEFCON speaker on the human brain and all its wonders, stumbled onto the 'computer underground' almost a decade ago and yet she still somehow has never managed to graduated from any secondary institution, still has never held a job of any great importance and still has yet to write a book. After eventually realizing that she would never become what society wanted her to be, she now happily works quietly at home on her projects; some which she shares at DEFCON.

**Joe "Kingpin" Grand** is an electrical engineer, hardware hacker, and former member of L0pht Heavy Industries. Even with his distrust of The Man, he has become a co-host of an upcoming engineering build show, Prototype This, for Discovery Channel, and has even done some stuff with biofeedback devices on the program. Sometimes he uses his real name, Joe Grand, and invents things for his company, Grand Idea Studio (www.grandideastudio.com). He's also the sole proprietor of Kingpin Empire, a hacker-inspired merchandise outfit (www.kingpinempire.com) that gives back to the community through charitable donations. He's designed the badge for DEFCON a few times, too.

### Anti-RE Techniques in DRM Code

##### Jan Newger

 *Security Researcher*

In order to prevent music from being copied among consumers, content providers often use DRM systems to protect their music files. This talk describes the approach taken while analysing a DRM system (whose identity needs to be kept secret due to legal issues). It is shown what techniques were used to protect the system from being easily reverse engineered. This is not about how to hack $Insert\_DRM\_Here. No decryption tools or information on how to write one will be released.

**Jan Newger** has been enjoying Reverse Engineering for years and he is going to receive his diploma in CS towards the end of the year. He has been working on several software projects in the field of mechanical engineering.

### VoIPER: Smashing the VoIP stack while you sleep

##### N.N.P.

 *Hacker, UnprotectedHex.com*

With VoIP devices finding their way into the majority of major enterprises and a significant number of residential installations, the possible consequences of a security vulnerability that can be leveraged by malicious hackers are ever increasing. While the security of data and voice traffic has been extensively promoted and tested the security of the devices themselves has been poorly tested at best. A remote vulnerability in a VoIP device could subvert all other VoIP security and as a result extensive testing of both VoIP device software and hardware is needed if we are to prevent future intrusions.

During this talk I will outline why the security of the software powering VoIP networks is of critical importance and why businesses, developers and security auditors need to pay more attention to the software they are deploying, developing and testing in real world installations. I will show the need for an automated, black box, protocol compliant and open source testing suite. I will then present VoIPER, a cross platform, easy to use toolkit that can automatically and extensively test VoIP devices as well as providing extensive target management, logging and crash detection critical to modern security testing. VoIPER includes a fuzzing suite which is fully protocol aware and can generate hundreds of thousands of tests for the major VoIP protocols. Unlike many attempts at fuzzing VoIP, VoIPER can interact with the devices under test in a fully protocol compliant fashion and potentially test their entire state spaces. Its classes are easy to use and extendable to allow users to piece together protocol compliant tests and integrate them with the main test suite.

VoIPER has been used to discover security vulnerabilities in every device tested during its initial testing phase including soft-phones, hard-phones, gateways and servers.

**N.N.P.** is a hacker from Ireland who's primary interests are in automating the vulnerability discovery and exploit development processes. He has been involved in the hacking and security communities for 6 years and discovered vulnerabilities in a variety of different applications. At the moment his main focus is on exploiting VoIP devices and the application of formal verification methods and dynamic binary instrumentation to fuzzing. He runs UnprotectedHex.com and is an administrator on the SmashTheStack wargaming network.

### The World of Pager Sniffing/Interception: More Activity than one may suspect

##### NYCMIKE

 *Hobbyist Signals Collector*

Paging networks once sat at the top of the personal and professional communication pyramid. Cell phone technology's have since replaced the now legacy networks at the consumer level, with the exception of niche markets (Due to the signal quality in doors: IT, Emergency Services, Government) the technology may have been retired to a permanent stay in a junk pile. With the fleeing attention and use, it appears that sniffing/interception of pager traffic within the United States has declined to almost a standstill. The scope of this paper is to re-introduce the activity of FLEX (1600/3200 level 2, 3200/6400 level 4) and POCSAG (512, 1200, 2400) then present how a hobbyist can decode it, provide a first hand account of how to install and operate a pager "listening Post", introduce a few ways to use captured cap codes, and offer a conceptual "new" technique in capture pager traffic. With that said, my expertise is limited and I by no means should be considered an expert nor should this writing be interpreted as testament. Last but not least there are laws governing over RF interception and they must be adhered (this means you).Decoding digital data with a soundcard now a days is easier than getting on the internet.

OpenVMS is considered a highly secure and reliable operating system relied upon by large enterprises around the globe such as Stock Exchanges, Governments and Infrastructure for critical operations.
Our talk will focus on subverting the security of the OpenVMS operating system in a number of new and creative ways. There will be an initial brief introduction to the OS basics, security model and its core features. We will also talk about things we perceive as flaws in the security model and weaknesses in the security features provided by OpenVMS. There will also be a practical demonstration of the 0day vulnerabilities found, ranging from logical to memory corruption bugs, along with discussion on how these were found and exploited and obstacles encountered in the process.

**Christer** is based in the UK. He enjoys discovering and exploiting new software vulnerabilities in pretty much everything except web applications. His favorite targets are OS kernels and "unusual" things like OpenVMS. Christer has previously presented at Black Hat Europe, USA and Defcon.

### Every Breath You Take

##### Jim O'Leary

 *Security Researcher*

How much data do you generate in the process of living an ordinary day? This talk covers various ways to gather, persist and analyze the data stream that is your life. We'll cover a few of the approaches that are available today, some easy code you can whip up to persist anything you please, and what to expect from the community and businesses moving forward. Privacy/security impact is sure to be huge, so hold on to your hats, and start tracking and logging everything! Somebody else may be doing it for you already..

### 365-Day: Active Https Cookie Hijacking

##### Mike Perry

 *Reverse Engineer, Riverbed Technology*

Last year during my Tor presentations at Black Hat and Defcon, and in a follow up post on BugTraq, I announced that many SSL secured websites are vulnerable to cookie hijacking by way of content element injection. Unfortunately, my announcement was overshadowed by Robert Graham's passive cookie stealing attacks (aka 'SideJacking').

The difference between our attacks is this: instead of sniffing passively for cookies, it is possible to actively cull them from targets on your local network by injecting images/iframes for desired sites into unrelated webpages. Moreover, since many sites do not set the 'secure' bit for their SSL cookies, it is even possible to grab cookies used in https sessions and use them to impersonate users. This will be demonstrated.

At the time of this writing, vulnerable SSL sites include Gmail, Facebook, Amazon, and many others. Since wide-spread awareness of the threat seems to be the only way to convince these vendors that they need to secure their cookies, fully automated exploit code will be provided two weeks after the demonstration (however, it is also possible to steal insecure https cookies with just airpwn and wireshark).

**Mike Perry** is a forward and reverse engineer employed by Riverbed Technology. He also moonlights as a volunteer for the Tor Project, and considers security a hobby. He is somewhat annoyed that the https cookie issues he discussed are still not fixed on most major websites, a full year later.

### Urban Exploration - A Hacker's View

##### Phreakmonkey

##### mutantMandias

Urban Exploration is the practice of discovering and exploring (and often photographing) the more "off-beat" areas of human civilization. Popular targets of Urban Exploration include abandoned hospitals or institutions, empty factories, and other disused structures, but it can also include "active" sites such as service corridors, utility levels, rooftops, storm drains, steam tunnels, you name it.

For years, the Urban Exploration community and Hacker community have existed in parallel despite their many commonalities. This talk will introduce UrbEx to the DefCon community and explore the similarity of the mindsets between those who explore the far reaches of cyberspace and those who explore the forgotten areas of the real world.

Bring an open mind, a sense of adventure, and any experiences you've had when you've wandered into a forgotten or "off limits" area just to see what's there. You might already be an Urban Explorer and not have realized it!

**K.C. (Phreakmonkey)** is a computer security engineer by trade and has attended DefCon for ten consecutive years. When he is not staring at computer screens he likes to apply his abstract thinking abilities to exploring the world around him and photographing what he discovers. K.C. has been exploring since he was a young child, when his mother had a penchant for self-guided tours of half-built houses. Ever since, he has been drawn to seeing what lies beyond unmarked doors or off-limits hallways. In recent years K.C. has combined photography with his love of the relics of our disposable infrastructure. Through sharing these photographs and experiences, he found that many people around him share his fascination with the forgotten and behind-the-scenes view of the world.

**Mandias** (mutantMandias) is an IT guy, Photographer, and Agitator who tries not to be blind to the world around him, and is constantly amazed by what people fail to see. He thinks that the back of a No Trespassing sign is beautiful, and always feels better when he is on the "other" side of barriers designed to keep people out. His exploration fetish was partially fed as a youngster by seeing a pro Neutron Bomb propaganda film which depicted a glorious victory over an enemy by simply melting away all of the people, leaving the buildings and industry intact. He thought it was a really cool idea, and likes to take pictures that embody that kind of feeling, but thinks that actually melting away all of the people in the world might take too much effort.

Mandias has explored and photographed with lots of people, in locations from Japan to Denmark to Canada. He is a founding member of S(UE), and habitually makes an ass of himself.

K.C. is a member of the Atlanta Urban Exploration League "AUEL" and the Southern Urban Explorers "S(UE)".

### Malware Detection through Network Flow Analysis

##### Bruce Potter

 *Founder, The Shmoo Group*

Over the last several years, we've seen a decrease in effectiveness of "classical" security tools. The nature of the present day attacks is very different from what the security community has been used to in the past. Rather than wide-spread worms and viruses that cause general havoc, attackers are directly targeting their victims in order to achieve monetary or military gain. These attacks are blowing right past firewalls and anti-virus and placing malware deep in the enterprise. Ideally, we could fix this problem at its roots; fixing the software that is making us vulnerable. Unfortunately that's going to take a while, and in the interim security engineers and operators need new, advanced tools that allow deeper visibility into systems and networks while being easy and efficient to use.

This talk will focus on using network flows to detect advanced malware. Network flows, made popular by Cisco's NetFlow implementation available on almost all their routers, has been used for years for network engineering purposes. And while there has been some capability for security analysis against these flows, there has been little interest until recently. This talk will describe NetFlow and how to implement it in your network. It will also examine advanced statistical analysis techniques that make finding malware and attackers easier. I will release a new version of Psyche, an open source flow analysis tool, and show specific examples of how to detect malware on live networks. I will also release a tool designed to craft and spoof netflow records for injection into netflow collectors.

**Bruce Potter** is the founder of the Shmoo Group of security, crypto, and privacy professionals. He is also the co-founder and CTO of Ponte Technologies, a company focused on developing and deploying advanced IT defensive technologies. His areas of expertise include wireless security, network analysis, trusted computing, pirate songs, and restoring hopeless vehicles. Mr. Potter has co-authored several books including "802.11 Security" and "Mastering FreeBSD and OpenBSD Security" published by O'Reilly and "Mac OS X Security" by New Riders.

### The true story of the Radioactive Boyscout:

##### The first nuclear hacker and how his work relates to Homeland Security's model of the dirty bomb

##### Paul F. Renda

 *Data Security Analyst*

David Hahn was working on his atomic energy Eagle Scout badge when he had the idea why not build a reactor. However, not just any reactor, he would build a breeder reactor. This type of reactor produces more fuel and power as long as it is working. David used social engineering, unlimited drive and resourcefulness to produce his reactor type device. He succeeded further that any expert in the nuclear world would have dreamed.

Ultimately, the EPA had to clean up his work shed as nuclear and chemical waste site.

I am going to perform a couple of Simple Safe demos related to David's work.

The second part of the talk will deal with Homeland Security s model of the dirty bomb. I will show how David's reactor relates to the current model.

At the end of the talk, I will issue the first annual Dr. Strangelove award for the best question submitted to Me. I have a lot of material to cover so try to study up on reactors.

**Paul F. Renda** started his career working on IBM 360 and the PDP 11. He was an early advocate of using Hacking Software to check corporate data systems and has presented talks at the COMPUTER SECURITY INSTITUTE. Paul s articles have appeared in the Info Security magazine.

In 1995 Paul, developed a defense against WAR DIALERS. His process was published in Info Security Magazine. A dialer is a program that dials a series of phone number and logs number that are connected to a modem. He is currently a computer security analyst.

### New Tool for SQL Injection with DNS Exfiltration

##### Robert Ricks

 *Senior Information Systems Engineer, G2, Inc.*

For years people have been warned that blind SQL injection is a problem, yet there are a multitude of vulnerable websites out there to this day. Perhaps people don't realize that these vulnerabilities are very real. The current state of the art tools are Absinthe and SQL Brute for exploiting blind SQL injection. DNS exfiltration has been proposed as a method of reaching previously unassailable blind SQL injection access points. We have created a proof-of-concept tool which can download an Oracle schema and data from its tables in an automated fashion using DNS as its exfiltration mechanism. Unlike Absinthe this tool does not require any difference between successful and unsuccessful queries to work. It is also much faster than current tools since it can retrieve more than one byte of information at a time and doesn't require noticeable differences in timing. Perhaps this will help people realize that their private data is exceedingly vulnerable if they have even one SQL injection access point and don't take appropriate precautions.

**Robert Ricks:** Bob works for G2, Inc. as a senior information systems engineer. He has experience in data mining, artificial intelligence and development of security and exploitation tools.

### Advanced Physical Attacks: Going Beyond Social Engineering and Dumpster Diving

##### Or, Techniques of Industrial Espionage

##### Eric Schmiedl

 *Security Researcher*

Your stack is smash-proof. Your dumpster is fully alarmed. And your firewall is so secure that it has former Soviet officials green with envy. So why are the developers finding their undocumented features in competitors' products, or company executives on a constant hunt for leaks and traitors? There's a whole lot more to doing an end-run around network security than calling up and pretending to be the help desk or hoping someone chucks a service manual in the trash Professional attackers with specific targets have a whole rash of techniques -- from using targeted employees to hiding microphones -- adopted from the world of espionage, and this talk is all about how they do what they do.

**Eric Schmiedl** has spoken on access control systems at BlackHat 2007 and safecracking at DEFCON 14. He is a member of the TOOOL.US Board of Directors, maintains a semblance of an undergraduate career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and has been picking locks all his life.

### Gaming - The Next Overlooked Security Hole

##### Ferdinand Schober

 *Security Researcher*

"Thanks to Web 2.0 and other over hyped BS, development has been moving farther and farther away from bare metal. Assuming you trust your libraries, this could even be called a good thing. If you're high."

PC gaming, despite Microsoft's best efforts, is not dead. Yet. The modding community is alive and active, and even those same over hyped web technologies are starting to encroach in to shaders, and other things they shouldn't touch. Let's no even get started on the shady communities providing bots, cheats, and other grey market goods.

We're now seeing those unifying technologies the web, and monolithic engines making their way in to these games. Automatic updates, electronic publishing systems, in-game advertisements, pay-for-item MMORPG systems all of these represent structural weaknesses that more and more people should be exploiting. Given the expectation of today's gamers a far as graphics, physics, and other frivolous crap, smaller developers have to purchase someone else's engine to get started and all of the bugs that come with it.

This presentation will begin with a quick overview of what we've seen so far, and will progress in to specific weak points in current and future releases.

High points will include:

\* Why buying someone else's engine is a bad idea (with charts!)

\* The proliferation of middleware, and the homogenization of gaming

\* The little "nude patch" that could: how to own yourself

\* Fake world + real money + ??? = Profit, or the economics of game exploits

**Ferdinand Schober** has been ranting about games for several years, and has been playing them in lieu of sleep since grade school. He recently left a security testing position with the highest ranked game publisher.

### Let's Sink the Phishermen's Boat!

##### Teo Sze Siong

 *Security Researcher, F-Secure Corporation*
##### Hirosh Joseph

 *Security Researcher, F-Secure Corporation*

In this presentation, an advanced form of phishing attack will be discussed to show the risk how criminals might steal the entire fund from an online banking account protected with daily transaction limit and bypassing the 2-factor authentication system. This type of attack is able to work in stealthy mode without showing theft symptoms in the bank account balance to keep the victims in the dark. Challenges and limitations encountered by the existing phishing detection techniques will be also identified and reviewed to understand the applicability of each technique in different scenarios.

As a step taken to combat phishing attacks effectively, the concept of 'website appearance signature' will be presented and explained how this new concept can be applied to detect unknown phishing websites. This has been a great challenge in the past since most phishing website detection tools verify the reputation of a website using a database of blacklisted URLs. In addition, a Proof-Of-Concept application employing the 'website appearance signature' combining with conventional phishing detection techniques will be demonstrated to see its accuracy and effectiveness as a phishing website detection tool.

**Teo Sze Siong** started programming at the age of 12. He is currently a Security Researcher at F-Secure Corporation, mainly working on threat analysis automation systems and honeyclient related research. His previous jobs as a Software Engineer with IRIS Corporation and Technical Consultant for InfiniteQL Group's R&D have exposed him to security area of various industries such as the government sector, casino, telecommunication, banking and property management companies.

### Medical Identity Theft

##### Eric Smith

 *Assistant Director of Information Security and Networking, Bucknell University*
##### Dr. Shana Dardan

 *Assistant Professor of Information Systems, Susquehanna University*

In less than an hour, during a scheduled pentest, our team was able to retrieve 3.2 million patient insurance records from a HIPAA-compliant medical facility. Using these records, we could have generated counterfeit insurance and prescription cards which would pass muster at any doctor's office or pharmacy counter. If you are one of the 47 million Americans with no health insurance or happen to have a medical condition you wished to hide from employers or insurers, would you consider purchasing falsified medical documents? Thousands of Americans have already said yes, without thinking twice about the victim of their victimless crime.

What happens to you if your medical identity is stolen? You may find yourself liable for thousands of dollars of co-pays, deductibles, and denied claims. Is this because you forgot to shred an important document? Did you fall for a phishing scheme online? Of course not -- it was entirely outside of your control, and it happened because the current HIPAA regulations are insufficient to protect your medical identity.

In this talk, we'll review the current state of HIPAA and other laws covering the security of your medical records, and discuss what changes need to be made, both in policy in practice, to shore up the security of our medical records.

### Living in the RIA World

##### Alex Stamos

 *Founding Partner, iSEC Partners Inc.*
##### David Thiel

 *Senior Security Consultant, iSEC Partners*
##### Justine Osborne

 *Security Consultant, iSEC Partners*

Rich Internet Applications (RIA) represent the next generation of the Web. Designed to run without constant Internet connectivity, they provide a graphical experience equivalent to thick desktop applications with the easy install experience of thin Web apps. They intentionally blur the line between websites and traditional desktop applications and greatly complicate the jobs of web developers, corporate security teams, and external security professionals.

Our goal with this talk will be to outline the different attack scenarios that exist in the RIA world and to provide a comparison between the security models of the leading RIA platforms. We will discuss how current attacks against web applications are changed with RIA as well as outline new types of vulnerabilities that are unique to this paradigm. Attendees will learn how to analyze the threat posed to them by RIA applications as either providers or consumers of software built on these new platforms.

We will also be discussing the attack surface exposed by the large media codec stacks contained in each of these platforms. Our targeted platforms include Adobe AIR, Microsoft Silverlight, Google Gears, JavaFX, and Mozilla Prism. At this talk, we will be releasing tools for testing the codec security of these platforms as well as sample malicious code demonstrating the danger of RIA applications.

### Inducing Momentary Faults Within Secure Smartcards / Microcontrollers

##### Christopher Tarnovsky

 *Flylogic Engineering, LLC*

This presentation is intended for individuals with an understanding of the Intel 8051 and Motorola 6805 processor families from an Assembly language perspective. This will be an interactive presentation with the audience.

Log files will be examined that have been taken from the targets (smartcards) at every clock cycle of the CPU during its runtime. We will discuss our possibilities and determine points in time (clock cycle periods) to momentarily induce a fault within the target.

Our goal will be to override the normal behavior of the target for our own use such as:

• Temporary changes- Readout of normally private records from the device

• Permanent changes- Change non-volatile memory to create a back-door or completely rewrite behavior model

Both smartcards contain a Cryptographic co-processor and are known to have been used to secure Data, PCs, laptops and Sun-Ray terminals.

**Flylogic Engineering, LLC** specializes in analysis of semiconductors from a security ""how strong is it really"" standpoint. We offer detailed reports on substrate attacks which define if a problem exists. If a problem is identified, we explain in a detailed report all aspects of how the attack was done, level of complexity and so on. This is something we believe is unique and allows the customer to then go back to the chip vendor armed with the knowledge to make them make it better (or possibly use a different part).

### Open in 30 Seconds: Cracking One of the Most Secure Locks in America

##### Marc Weber Tobias

 *Investigative Attorney and Security Specialist – Security.org*
##### Matt Fiddler

 *Security Specialist – Security.org*

Many high security lock manufacturers claim that their cylinders are impervious to covert methods of entry including picking, bumping, and decoding and that they offer high levels of key control, effectively preventing the illegal or unauthorized duplication of their keys. New and unique methods to compromise one of the most secure locks in America by forced, covert, and surreptitious entry were developed during an eighteen month research project that has resulted in the filing of multiple patents and the ability to pick, bump, and mechanically bypass Medeco cylinders, sometimes in seconds. In this presentation we offer a detailed analysis of how the Medeco lock was compromised by a methodical analysis of its physical characteristics and their code database.

Medeco is the dominant leader in the North American high security lock sector. They protect venues that include the White House, Pentagon, and Royal Family residence in London. They are relied upon throughout the world for their security and invulnerability to attacks. As a result of disclosures by the presenters at DEFCON 15, they were forced to urgently upgrade their deadbolt locks. The new techniques of bypass that will be disclosed in this presentation will be equally significant, if not even more concerning because of their widespread security implications.

##### Philosopher

 *Security Researcher*

Outdoor digital billboards are becoming the new way to advertise multiple products/services/etc with a single board as compared to having a street littered with dozens of these eyesores. Therefore, they're more fun to take apart and play with. While driving one day, I noticed a 404 error on one of these billboards and after discussing it with my fellow speakers, hatched a plan to hack into their network and advertise our own ideas/ "products". We will be talking about how we exploited the physical and network security of this well known company and used these to upload our own images. This is \*not\* a step-by-step how to, but rather addresses the vulnerabilities that exist and how they could be used for guerilla advertising and digital graffiti.

### MetaPost-Exploitation

##### Valsmith

 *CTO, Offensive Computing, LLC*
##### Colin Ames

 *Researcher, Offensive Computing, LLC*

When penetration testing large environments, testers require the ability to maintain persistent access to systems they have exploited, leverage trusts to access other systems, and increase their foothold into the target. Post exploitation activities are some of the most labor intensive aspects of pen testing. These include password management, persistent host access, privileged escalation, trust relationships, acquiring GUI access, etc. Penetration testers acquire hashes, crack them, keep track of which passwords go with which usernames / systems and finally reuse this information to penetrate further systems.

**Valsmith** has been involved in the computer security community and industry for over ten years. He currently works as a professional security researcher on problems for both the government and private sectors. He specializes in penetration testing (over 40,000 machines assessed), reverse engineering and malware research. Valsmith is a member of the Cult of the Dead Cow NSF. He also works on the Metasploit Project development team as well as other vulnerability development efforts. Most recently Valsmith founded Offensive Computing, a public, open source malware research project.

### Compliance: The Enterprise Vulnerability Roadmap

##### Weasel

 *Nomad Mobile Research Centre*

Compliance is no longer new. Compliance has been accepted by the corporate-state. Compliance is common-place. Compliance is the intruders' new friend. Decision makers thinks Compliance == Security. While many compliance standards have resulted in the implementation of some very important controls, they have also left a roadmap for intruders, ill doers and the sort to hone their attack. This presentation will go over such weaknesses and show how compliance entities are, regardless of intent, proving that compliance != security.

**Weasel** is a veteran member Nomad Mobile Research Centre. Over the years he has performed deep research into areas ranging from Forensics/Anti-Forensics to Enterprise Culture to Cyber Warfare and Binary Analysis. Weasel is the last surviving international member of NMRC as Canada has been ruled too lame to be considered "international."

### Password Cracking on a Budget

##### Matt Weir

 *Security Researcher*
##### Sudhir Aggarwal

 *Security Researcher*

Not every bad guy writes down passwords on sticky note by their monitor. Not every system administrator fully documents everything before they leave. There are a lot of legitimate reasons why you might need to crack a password. The problem is most people don't have a supercomputer sitting in their basement or the money to go out and buy a rack of FPGAs. This talk deals with getting the most out of the computing resources you do have when cracking passwords.

Our group at Florida State University is currently working on password cracking research to aid in forensics analysis. We've analyzed disclosed password lists to try and figure out how real people actually create passwords. Not all of these lists have been in plain text so we've had to go through the pain of cracking passwords ourselves. Just like you, we are still waiting on funding for that supercomputer as well. In this talk, we'll go over some of the tools and techniques we've used to crack these password lists using only a couple of PCs, such as custom wordlist generation and choosing the right word mangling rules. We'll also talk about some of the lessons we've learned and the mistakes we've made along the way.

**Matt Weir** is a PhD student at Florida State University. Before his journey back into academia, he worked as a network security engineer for Northrop Grumman. The projects he's been a part of have ranged from providing first responders with wireless access, to assisting the Defense Department with computer forensics. Why he decided to go back to school no one knows (including him sometimes). It wasn't the pay that's for sure!

**Sudhir Aggarwal** has been Professor of Computer Science at Florida State University since the fall of 2002. He directs the E-Crime Investigative Technologies Laboratory. Previous to his current position, he was Chief Technology Officer of the Internet Content Delivery and Distribution business unit of Lucent Technologies, where he was responsible for the architecture, portfolio, and development of the Imminet product line. Dr. Aggarwal's current research interests are in building software tools and systems that support cybersecurity and digital forensics. He is also interested in computer and communication networks where he has investigated infrastructures for network games and techniques for building efficient overlay networks.

### New ideas for old practices - Port-Scanning improved

##### Fabian "fabs" Yamaguchi

 *Recurity Labs GmbH, Berlin, Germany*
##### FX

 *Head of Recurity Labs*

How fast a port-scan can be is largely dependent on the performance of the network in question. Nonetheless, it is clear that choosing the most efficient scanning-speed is only possible based on sufficient information on the network's performance. We have thus designed and implemented a port-scanning method which provokes extra network-activity to increase the amount of information at our disposal in an attempt to gain speed on the long run.

Following this approach, we've managed to mimic TCPs properties to an extend which allows us to implement many congestion control schemes initially designed for TCP. Further tweaking the actual implementation by integrating it into the linux-kernel left us with a port-scanner ready to tackle big networks at an impressive speed.

**Fabian "fabs" Yamaguchi** currently studies computer-science and electrical engineering at the Berlin Institute of Technology where he focuses on data-communication and signal-processing. He has been working as a reverse-engineer and software-developer for Recurity Labs GmbH for about two years. During his school-time, he has worked on free-software projects such as the AfterStep-window-manager and he received the ArsDigita-Prize at MIT in 2001 for maintaining the "Young Programmer's Network", a community-project for young free-software-developers. Additionally, he has given presentations on port-scanning and bug-exploitation at the 24C3 and the 4th annual MNU congress in Berlin.

**Felix "FX" Lindner** runs Recurity Labs. FX has over 10 years experience in the computer industry, eight of them in consulting for large enterprise and telecommunication customers. He possesses a vast knowledge of computer sciences, telecommunications and software development. His background includes managing and participating in a variety of projects with a special emphasis on security planning, implementation, operation and testing using advanced methods in diverse technical environments.

### The Death Envelope: A Medieval Solution to a 21st Century Problem

##### Matt Yoder

 *Security Researcher*

While many aftercare solutions and recommendations cover "average American" needs, none have tackled, full-on, the needs of the rapidly growing high tech segment of the population. As the amount of passwords and other secret "brainspace-only" information grows for many, many, individuals, it becomes obvious that a solution is needed for the dispensation of this information in the event of one's death or extreme disablement. It turns out that this solution may be the humble paper envelope.

This talk begins to examine an approach to handle this problem, offering many suggestions, from the extremely reliable low-tech end, through hybrid and high tech solutions to the problem. It covers, as well, recommendations for what to include in one's envelope, and how to ensure its safety, security, and integrity. It also discusses why a wax stamp, sealed by a signet ring, no less, may still offer the best envelope tamper detection that exists.

**Matt Yoder** brings more than 15 years of general IT experience to this talk, including extensive time in systems administration of all flavors, including multiple forms of network devices. He has also spent time, in multiple stints, performing direct security consulting, including assessment and auditing, security systems support, and firewall deployment. When this experience is combined with a love of pen and paper, a detailed examination of the Death Envelope is the result. He currently spends his days, and earns something resembling an income, assisting with server administration for a major University in Colorado, which prefers to go unnamed.

### DAVIX Visualization Workshop

Need help understanding your gigabytes of application logs or network captures? Your OS performance metrics do not make sense? Then DAVIX, the live CD for visualizing IT data, is your answer!

To simplify the analysis of vast amounts of security data, visualization is slowly penetrating the security community. There are many free tools available for analysis and visualization of data. To simplify the use of these tools, the open source project DAVIX was put to life and is released this year at BlackHat/DEFCON.

At this "Bring Your Own Laptop" workshop we will introduce you to DAVIX. The workshop starts with an introduction to the set of available tools, the integrated manual, as well as customizing the CD to your needs. In a second part, you can use DAVIX to analyze a set of provided packet captures. In the end we will show some of the visualizations created by the participants. Be prepared for pretty and meaningful pictures!

For you to be able to participate in the analysis part of the workshop, you should bring an Intel or AMD x86 based notebook with at least 1GB of memory and a wireless LAN adapter. To avoid problems with the Wireless card setup we strongly recommend that you run DAVIX in VMware Player or VMware Fusion in NAT mode. The DAVIX ISO image should be downloaded before the workshop from the davix.secviz.org homepage. The network capture files will be made available during the workshop.

##### Description

When configuring a web application to use only ssl (e. g. by forwarding
all http-requests to https), a user would expect that sniffing and hijacking
the session is impossible.

Though, for this to be secure, one needs to set the session cookie to have
the secure flag. Else the cookie will be transferred through http if the
victim's browser does a single http-request on the same domain.

Joomla 1.5.8 does not set that flag. I've contacted the Joomla security team in
advance but got no reply.
