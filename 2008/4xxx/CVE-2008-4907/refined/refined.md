Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2008-4907:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Dovecot's parsing of email headers. Specifically, the parser fails when encountering invalid message addresses such as "From: (". This parsing error leads to a crash of the Dovecot process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation in the email header parsing logic.
- Insufficient error handling when encountering malformed email headers.
- A crash vulnerability leading to denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can send a specially crafted email with a malformed "From:" header to a user, causing the Dovecot process to crash when attempting to parse the header. This effectively makes the user's mailbox inaccessible via Dovecot, preventing the user from retrieving email.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by sending a crafted email to a target user.
- **Email Header:** The specific attack vector is a malformed message address (e.g., "From: (") in the email header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send email to a user managed by a vulnerable Dovecot server.
- No specific user privileges are needed on the target system itself; the vulnerability is exploited through the email processing logic of the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Dovecot versions prior to 1.1.7-r1.
- The vulnerability affects IMAP clients that use the `FETCH ENVELOPE` command, as that is when the header parsing is triggered.
- The issue was fixed in Dovecot version 1.1.6, although it is noted that versions before v1.1.4 are not affected.
- Ubuntu addressed the issue with a patch in version 1:1.1.4-0ubuntu1.2.

This is more detailed than the standard CVE description, which simply states a "Denial of Service with broken mail headers".
