| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=470466#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-11-07 11:03:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 322841](attachment.cgi?id=322841&action=diff "Proposed patch from Drew Yao") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=322841&action=edit "Proposed patch from Drew Yao") Proposed patch from Drew Yao  Description of problem:  Drew Yao from Apple Product Security has reported integer overflow leading to memory corruption present in the xmlSAX2Characters() function in the libxml2 library. User could trigger this flaw by providing very large XML file for parsing to the XML parsing library, which would corrupt the memory and might potentially allow arbitrary code execution.  Proposed patch: See attachment.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Drew Yao of the Apple Product Security team for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=470466#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-11-07 11:16:35 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 322844](attachment.cgi?id=322844&action=diff "Modified patch from Drew to consider condition, when SIZE_T_MAX isn't defined in limits.h") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=322844&action=edit "Modified patch from Drew to consider condition, when SIZE_T_MAX isn't defined in limits.h") Modified patch from Drew to consider condition, when SIZE_T_MAX isn't defined in limits.h   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=470466#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-11-07 11:21:57 UTC  ``` This issue affects all versions of the libxml2 package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3 (the relevant part of code is in SAX.c, the "characters()" function) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5  (the relevant part of code is in SAX2.c, function xmlSAX2Characters()).   This issue affects all versions of the libxml2 package, as shipped with Fedora release of 8, 9 and 10.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=470466#c7)  Daniel Veillard    2008-11-12 15:45:04 UTC  ``` Okay, I confirm the patch is correct and the way to define SIZE_T_MAX is probably the most correct/portable possible. BTW SIZE_T_MAX seems to be Apple/BSD specific, it doesn't look like of the standard C library (or at least not present in older versions).

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- libxml2
An integer overflow in libxml2 could lead to memory corruption and
arbitrary code execution (CVE-2008-4226).

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

# USN-673-1: libxml2 vulnerabilities

19 November 2008

libxml2 vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [libxml2](/security/cves?package=libxml2) -

## Details

Drew Yao discovered that libxml2 did not correctly handle certain corrupt

XML documents. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing

a malicious XML document, a remote attacker could cause applications

linked against libxml2 to enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2008-4225](/security/CVE-2008-4225))

Drew Yao discovered that libxml2 did not correctly handle large memory

allocations. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

very large XML document, a remote attacker could cause applications linked

against libxml2 to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-4226](/security/CVE-2008-4226))

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.27.dfsg-6.

For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.

## 1. Overview:

A new Sun Alert Notification from Sun Microsystems
has been issued and is described below. Additional information
about this issue may be found on the
[sunsolve.sun.com](http://sunsolve.sun.com) website, although a maintenance contract with Sun
may be required to view the information.

xmlBufferResize() and xmlSAX2Characters() May Lead to
Arbitrary Code Execution or Denial of Service (DoS)

Product: Solaris 9 Operating System, Solaris 10 Operating System,
OpenSolaris

Category: Security

Date Released: 03-Feb-2009
<http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-66-251406-1>

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names
[CVE-2008-4225](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4225) and

## 2. Avaya System Products using a Sun Microsystems Operating System:

Some Avaya system products are
delivered with an Operating System
from Sun Microsystems. Actions to be
taken on these products are described
below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CMS | R13/R13.1, R14/R14.1, R15 | Low | Customers on CMS version R13 must first upgrade to R13.1 then apply patch 114014-22 to resolve this issue.  Customers on CMS version R14 must first upgrade to R14.1 then apply patch 114014-22 to resolve this issue. Customers on CMS version R15, apply patch 125731-04 to resolve this issue. |
| Avaya IR | 3.0, 4.0 | Low | IR does not use or support the affected libxml2 library routines. Therefore Avaya will not verify the patch for use with IR |

**Recommended Actions:**

Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. Loading a corrupt delta disk may cause ESX to crash
If the VMDK delta disk of a snapshot is corrupt, an ESX host might crash when the corrupted disk is loaded. VMDK delta files exist for virtual machines with one or more snapshots. This change ensures that a corrupt VMDK delta file cannot be used to crash ESX hosts.

A corrupt VMDK delta disk, or virtual machine would have to be loaded by an administrator.

VMware would like to thank Craig Marshall for reporting this issue.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4914 to this issue.

b. Updated Service Console package net-snmp
Net-SNMP is an implementation of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP is used by network management systems to monitor hosts.

A denial-of-service flaw was found in the way Net-SNMP processes SNMP GETBULK requests. A remote attacker who issued a specially-crafted request could cause the snmpd server to crash.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4309 to this issue.

#####

c. Updated Service Console package libxml2
An integer overflow flaw causing a heap-based buffer overflow was found in the libxml2 XML parser. If an application linked against libxml2 processed untrusted, malformed XML content, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4226 to this issue.

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the libxml2 XML parser. If an application linked against libxml2 processed untrusted, malformed XML content, it could cause the application to enter an infinite loop.

libxml2 security update (RHSA-2008-0988)

Original Release Date: January 5, 2009

Last Revised: July 1, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-002

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

libxml2 is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. It
includes
support for reading, modifying, and writing XML and HTML files.

An integer overflow flaw causing a heap-based buffer overflow was
found in
the libxml2 XML parser. If an application linked against libxml2
processed
untrusted, malformed XML content, it could cause the application to
crash
or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2008-4226](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4226) to this issue.

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the libxml2 XML parser. If
an
application linked against libxml2 processed untrusted, malformed XML
content, it could cause the application to enter an infinite loop.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name [CVE-2008-4225](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4225) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0988.html>

Avaya has rated this as a Low risk level as either the package is
installed but not used by any application or exploitation would require
direct non-standard user interaction.

## 2. Avaya System Products with libxml2 installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | 5.1 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to CM 5.2 or later. |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 | Low | This will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya Message Storage Server | 5.0 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to MSS 5.1 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya SIP Enablement Services | 5.1 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to SES 5.2 or later. |
| Avaya Voice Portal | 4.1 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to VP 5.0 or later. |

| Avaya AES | 4.2.1 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to AES 4.2.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all vulnerable system products,
Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied by RedHat Linux.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# libxml2: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200812-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libxml2 might lead to execution of arbitrary
code or Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libxml2** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.7.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.7.2-r1** |

### Background

libxml2 is the XML (eXtended Markup Language) C parser and toolkit
initially developed for the Gnome project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were reported in libxml2:

* Andreas Solberg reported that libxml2 does not properly detect
  recursion during entity expansion in an attribute value
  (CVE-2008-3281).
* A heap-based buffer overflow has been reported in the
  xmlParseAttValueComplex() function in parser.c (CVE-2008-3529).
* Christian Weiske reported that predefined entity definitions in
  entities are not properly handled (CVE-2008-4409).
* Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported an integer overflow in the
  xmlBufferResize() function that can lead to an infinite loop
  (CVE-2008-4225).
* Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported an integer overflow in the
  xmlSAX2Characters() function leading to a memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-4226).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to open a
specially crafted XML document with an application using libxml2,
possibly resulting in the exeution of arbitrary code or a high CPU and
memory consumption.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libxml2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.7.2-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#### Safari 4.0

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1704

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Downloaded image files may be misidentified as HTML, leading to JavaScript execution without warning the user

  Description: Image files are 'safe' types that, once downloaded, are displayed by Safari without warning the user. An issue in Safari may cause it to be unable to identify the file type of certain local image files. In this case, Safari will examine the content of those files and may treat them as HTML. If a file contains JavaScript, it will be executed in the local context. For a downloaded file, this should not occur without first prompting the user. This issue is addressed by treating files of unknown type as generic binary data, and by correctly identifying the image file types known to have this issue. Credit to Sergio 'shadown' Alvarez of Recurity Labs GmbH for reporting this issue.

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1716

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: A local user may be able to read the contents of files being downloaded by other users

  Description: CFNetwork creates temporary files insecurely when downloading. A local user may be able to access another user's files as they are downloaded, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by downloading files to the user's secure temporary directory location. For Mac OS X systems, this issue is addressed in Mac OS X v10.5.6. Credit to Billy Rios and Microsoft Vulnerability Research for reporting this issue.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-2321

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: CoreGraphics contains memory corruption issues in the processing of arguments. Passing untrusted input to CoreGraphics via an application, such as a web browser, may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. For Mac OS X systems, this issue is addressed in Security Update 2008-005. Credit to Michal Zalewski of Google Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1705

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A memory corruption issue exists in the handling of TrueType fonts. An arithmetic issue in the automatic hinting of fonts may cause memory corruption. Visiting a maliciously crafted website with embedded fonts may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved input validation of TrueType font data. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems. Credit to Clint Ruoho of Laconic Security and Tavis Ormandy of Google Security Team for reporting this issue.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0946

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in FreeType v2.3.8

  Description: Multiple integer overflows exist in FreeType v2.3.8, that may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issues through improved bounds checking. These issues do not affect CoreGraphics on Mac OS X systems. Credit to Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team for reporting these issues.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0145

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: Multiple memory corruption issues exist in CoreGraphics' handling of PDF files. Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issues through improved bounds and error checking. For Mac OS X v10.5 systems, this issue is addressed in Mac OS X v10.5.7. For Mac OS X v10.4.11 systems, this issue is addressed in Security Update 2009-002.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1179

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: An integer overflow exists in CoreGraphics' handling of PDF files containing JBIG2 streams. Opening a PDF file containing a maliciously crafted JBIG2 stream may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. Credit to Will Dormann of CERT/CC for reporting this issue.

* **ImageIO**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0040

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Processing a maliciously crafted PNG image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: An uninitialized pointer issue exists in the handling of PNG images. Processing a maliciously crafted PNG image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue by performing additional validation of PNG images. Credit to Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team for reporting this issue.

* **International Components for Unicode**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0153

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Maliciously crafted content may bypass website filters and result in cross-site scripting

  Description: An implementation issue exists in ICU's handling of certain character encodings. Using ICU to convert invalid byte sequences to Unicode may result in over-consumption, where trailing bytes are considered part of the original character. This may be leveraged by an attacker to bypass filters on websites that attempt to mitigate cross-site scripting. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of invalid byte sequences. For Mac OS X v10.5 systems, this issue is addressed in Mac OS X v10.5.7. Credit to Chris Weber of Casaba Security for reporting this issue.

* **libxml**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3281, CVE-2008-3529, CVE-2008-4409, CVE-2008-4225, CVE-2008-4226

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in libxml2 version 2.6.16

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in libxml2 version 2.6.16, the most serious of which may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. On Windows, the issues are addressed by updating libxml2 to version 2.7.3. On Mac OS X v10.4.11 and Mac OS X v10.5.7, the issues are addressed by applying the relevant patches.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1682

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Visiting a website with a revoked EV certificate may not display a certificate warning

  Description: An issue in Safari's handling of Extended Validation (EV) certificates may cause the revocation checking to be bypassed. This would allow a page to be loaded without issuing a warning for a revoked EV certificate. This update addresses the issue through improved revocation checking for EV certificates. Credit to Bruce Morton for reporting this issue.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1706

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Cookies set during a private browsing session may remain after private browsing ends

  Description: Safari's Private Browsing feature is designed to allow users to browse without leaving evidence of the browser session on disk. An implementation issue in Private Browsing may cause cookies to remain on disk after Private Browsing ends. This may result in an unexpected disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by removing cookies from the alternate cookie store when private browsing is disabled, or Safari quits. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems. Credit to Michael Hay of Beatnik Monkey Software for reporting this issue.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1707

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: "Reset Safari" may not immediately remove website passwords from memory

  Description: After clicking the "Reset" button for "Reset saved names and passwords" in the "Reset Safari..." menu option, Safari may take up to 30 seconds to clear the passwords. A user with access to the system in that time window may be able to access the stored credentials. This issue is addressed by resolving the race condition that leads to the delay. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems. Credit to Philippe Couturier of izypage.com, and Andrew Wellington of The Australian National University for reporting this issue.

* **Safari**
