| CVSS Meta Temp ScoreCVSS is a standardized scoring system to determine possibilities of attacks. The Temp Score considers temporal factors like disclosure, exploit and countermeasures. The unique Meta Score calculates the average score of different sources to provide a normalized scoring system. | Current Exploit Price (≈)Our analysts are monitoring exploit markets and are in contact with vulnerability brokers. The range indicates the observed or calculated exploit price to be seen on exploit markets. A good indicator to understand the monetary effort required for and the popularity of an attack. | CTI Interest ScoreOur Cyber Threat Intelligence team is monitoring different web sites, mailing lists, exploit markets and social media networks. The CTI Interest Score identifies the interest of attackers and the security community for this specific vulnerability in real-time. A high score indicates an elevated risk to be targeted for this vulnerability. |

A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in [Pro2col Stingray FTS](?product.pro2col:stingray_fts) ([affected version unknown](?kb.version)). This issue affects an unknown functionality. The manipulation of the argument `Username` with an unknown input leads to a cross site scripting vulnerability. Using CWE to declare the problem leads to [CWE-80](?vulnerability_cwe.3809 "Cwe"). The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages. Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

The weakness was shared 09/12/2008 by Marc Ruef with scip AG as not defined mailinglist post (Bugtraq). The advisory is shared at [seclists.org](?advisory_url.3809). The identification of this vulnerability is [CVE-2008-10001](?source_cve.3809 "Cve"). The attack may be initiated remotely. It demands that the victim is doing some kind of user interaction. Technical details are known, but no exploit is available. MITRE ATT&CK project uses the attack technique [T1059.007](?vulnerability_attck.3809 "Attck") for this issue.

We expect the 0-day to have been worth approximately [$5k-$25k](?kb.exploitprices).

Upgrading eliminates this vulnerability.
