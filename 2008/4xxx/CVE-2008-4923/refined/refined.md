Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure methods within the MW6 Aztec ActiveX control (Aztec.dll). Specifically, the `SaveAsBMP` and `SaveAsWMF` methods are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Method:** The `SaveAsBMP` and `SaveAsWMF` methods in the ActiveX control do not properly validate the filename passed to them, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite:** By providing a malicious file path as an argument to the vulnerable methods, an attacker can potentially overwrite or create files in arbitrary locations on the user's system, potentially leading to system compromise.
*   **Complete Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impact:** The provided CVSS score of 10/10 for impact subscore indicates a potential for complete impact on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** This vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Web-based Attack:** By embedding the ActiveX control within a malicious webpage, an attacker could entice a victim to load the webpage and thereby trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable ActiveX Control:** The attacker needs to know the `clsid` of the ActiveX control and the names of the vulnerable methods (`SaveAsBMP` and/or `SaveAsWMF`).
*   **Ability to Serve a Webpage:** The attacker needs to host a webpage that contains the malicious script that calls the vulnerable ActiveX control with a crafted file path.
*   **Victim's Web Browser:** The victim needs to be using a vulnerable browser that supports ActiveX controls, such as Internet Explorer.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable ActiveX control is identified by `clsid:F359732D-D020-40ED-83FF-F381EFE36B54`.
*   The exploit uses VBScript to interact with the ActiveX control.
*   The exploit provides a full file path as the filename argument to `SaveAsBMP`. Example `arg1="c:\windows\system\_.ini"`.
*   The vulnerability exists in version 3.0.0.1 of the Aztec ActiveX.
*   The ActiveX control is part of the `Aztec.dll` file.
