# CVE-2008-4100

| **Name** | CVE-2008-4100 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | GNU adns 1.4 and earlier uses a fixed source port and sequential transaction IDs for DNS requests, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof DNS responses, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-1447. NOTE: the vendor reports that this is intended behavior and is compatible with the product's intended role in a trusted environment. |

Applying this rule, separate id should probably be used for PyDNS [1]
[2] and adns [3] as well, at they both suffer from the similar flaws -
use predictable transactions ids and source port.

PyDNS should be fixed as of upstream version 2.3.2 [4], adns issue is
rather considered a design decision as documented in the INSTALL file
[5].

# CVE-2008-1447

| **Name** | CVE-2008-1447 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The DNS protocol, as implemented in (1) BIND 8 and 9 before 9.5.0-P1, 9.4.2-P1, and 9.3.5-P1; (2) Microsoft DNS in Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, and Server 2003 SP1 and SP2; and other implementations allow remote attackers to spoof DNS traffic via a birthday attack that uses in-bailiwick referrals to conduct cache poisoning against recursive resolvers, related to insufficient randomness of DNS transaction IDs and source ports, aka "DNS Insufficient Socket Entropy Vulnerability" or "the Kaminsky bug." |

## Notes

```
glibc stub resolver relies on source port randomisation in kernel
Just a stub resolver Linux kernel provides source port randomisation
adns is not suitable to use with untrusted responses, documented in README.Debian
Source port randomization from Lenny kernel should provide sufficient protection
since this is just a Perl nodule for DNS queries and not a high-profile server app like
Bind, it's unlikely that a home-grown fix will provide an implementation of higher
cryptographical quality. Marking the version from Lenny as fixed, since Lenny includes
a kernel which provides source port randomization
Unbound, djbdns, pdnsd and PowerDNS are affected by the underlying protocol issue, but
already use source port randomization.
Marking non-caching stub resolvers as low since these really should be fixed,
but are much less vulnerable than a caching server.

Hi,

From inspecting the code of ands, it seems that it is not using the
recommended source port randomisation for countering the cache poisoning
attack as discovered by Dan Kaminski and referenced as [CVE-2008-1447](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1447).

Since this is a stub resolver the risk is lesser than for caching nameservers,
but nonetheless this is an issue which we really should be fixing in lenny.
Can you please look into that? As it seems a fix for important bugs can still
be granted a freeze exception.

If a straghtforward fix is available for etch, it would be released by the
security team.

thanks,
Thijs

Ian, are you planning a fix for this?

the relevant recommendations, btw, are available in an ietf draft rfc:

The short answer is no, not in any reasonable timescale.  It's not
even clear whether a fix is possible for a stub resolver, which
typically doesn't have the luxury of a whole IP address to itself and
which can't reasonably allocate thousands of ports.

adns has always used entirely predictable sequence numbers and expects
that the path between it and the nameserver does not permit an
attacker to inject spoofed packets that appear to come from the
nameserver.  Quoting the source:

  setup.c:  ads->nextid= 0x311f;

This is documented in INSTALL:

  SECURITY AND PERFORMANCE - AN IMPORTANT NOTE

  adns is not a `full-service resolver': it does no caching of responses
  at all, and has no defence against bad nameservers or fake packets
  which appear to come from your real nameservers.  It relies on the
  full-service resolvers listed in resolv.conf to handle these tasks.

  For secure and reasonable operation you MUST run a full-service
  nameserver on the same system as your adns applications, or on the
  same local, fully trusted network.  You MUST only list such
  nameservers in the adns configuration (eg resolv.conf).

  You MUST use a firewall or other means to block packets which appear
  to come from these nameservers, but which were actually sent by other,
  untrusted, entities.

  Furthermore, adns is not DNSSEC-aware in this version; it doesn't
  understand even how to ask a DNSSEC-aware nameserver to perform the
  DNSSEC cryptographic signature checking.

Ian.

Thanks, Ian.

Robert - I think the best course of action now is to document this property in
the package; the referenced INSTALL file is not currently in the binary
packages. I suggest adding a shorter note to the package description and
perhaps this longer explanation from the INSTALL to a file under /u/s/d/,
e.g. README.security.

Thijs

There's now a published exploit explicitly targeting things running adns:
<http://milw0rm.com/exploits/6197>
I believe it would be good to make an upload soon that makes it clear to users
that adns should not be used outside trusted environments.

severity 492698 serious
thanks

Hi,

I'm upgrading this bug to release critical, as I believe it's not
acceptable to release adns in stable, while there's no way a user can know
that it can only be used in trusted environments. As noted there's a
published exploit making use of adns.

Really the only thing needed to solve this bug is to document, but that
documentation is essential before we can release adns with lenny.

cheers,
Thijs

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
