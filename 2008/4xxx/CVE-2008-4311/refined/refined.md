Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2008-4311:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   The root cause lies in the default configuration of `system.conf` in D-Bus (versions prior to 1.2.6). Specifically, the default policy for both sent and received messages was incorrectly configured, effectively allowing all traffic instead of the intended default-deny policy. This was due to the omission of the `send_type` attribute in certain rules and a faulty conditional check for non-reply messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Access Control Bypass:** The overly permissive default policy allowed local users to bypass intended access restrictions on the system bus. This is manifested in two ways:
    -   **Sending Messages:**  The vulnerability allowed sending of non-reply messages when only replies were intended to be allowed. This was because the rules were not being correctly applied to non-reply messages.
    -   **Receiving Messages:** Similarly, there was a potential for unintended message reception due to the same policy flaw. The receive side permission was also too open.
-   **Lack of Explicit Deny Rules:** Many services relied on the default-deny policy and did not have explicit `<deny>` rules, making them vulnerable to this bypass.
-   **Over-reliance on Defaults:** Some services did not implement service-side security checks, relying solely on the D-Bus access control, which was flawed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Local Privilege Escalation:**  By bypassing the access controls, local users could potentially interact with system services in unintended ways, leading to privilege escalation or other unauthorized actions.
-   **Service Disruption:** The flawed policy could cause certain services to break when the default-deny policy was finally enforced with a fix. As some services were expecting an allow by default.
-   **Information Disclosure:** Vulnerable services could disclose information if the access restrictions could be bypassed.
-   **System Instability:** Some applications relying on implicit permissions were crashing and causing system instability when the fix was introduced.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have user-level access to the system where D-Bus is running.
-   **Message Interception/Manipulation:** Attackers could use this flaw to send or receive DBus messages that they weren't authorized to send or receive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the affected system to send messages on the system bus.
-   **Knowledge of D-Bus:** The attacker should have knowledge of the dbus communication protocols to send/receive and manipulate the messages.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability was a multi-step process, with a first step to enforce a default deny for send messages. The receive permissions remained more open in this first step because tightening them would have broken too many applications.
*   A number of affected packages were identified, such as ConsoleKit, PackageKit, bluez, avahi-daemon, and various GNOME components that required updates to correctly function under the more restrictive DBus policy.
*   The fix involved changing the default configuration to explicitly require specifying message types (`send_type="method_return"`, `send_type="error"`) for `send_requested_reply` rules instead of implicitly applying them to all types.
*   The fix introduced logging to help identify applications affected by the stricter policy. The log messages included information like message type, sender, interface, member, error name, destination and `requested_reply`.
*   The content notes that there is an increasing trend for services to use PolicyKit or other service-side security checks, which would make them unaffected by this vulnerability.
*   The SELinux D-Bus support is also noted as not being affected.
