{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `SaveAsPDF()` method in the GdPicture Pro ActiveX control allows creating or overwriting files due to insufficient validation of the `sFilePath` argument. Additionally, by injecting HTML code into other arguments such as `sTitle`, an attacker can execute arbitrary code via the `hcp://` protocol.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "File overwrite vulnerability",
      "Code injection vulnerability",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files, inject malicious HTML, and execute code using the `hcp://` protocol, potentially leading to system compromise and privilege escalation by adding user to administrator group.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By exploiting the `SaveAsPDF()` method via a crafted HTML page.",
        "The attacker injects malicious HTML into arguments such as `sTitle`.",
        "The `hcp://` protocol is used to execute the injected code."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to open a malicious HTML page in Internet Explorer. The vulnerable ActiveX control needs to be installed on the system.",
     "more_info": "The vulnerability also exists in `GdPicturePro5.Imaging`, but this version does not implement the `IObjectSafety` interface. The provided exploit code utilizes `cmd.exe` to add a user 'test' to the Administrators group as an example."
