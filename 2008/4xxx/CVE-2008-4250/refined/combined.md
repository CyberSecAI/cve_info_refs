How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Alert
# Conficker Worm Targets Microsoft Windows Systems

Last RevisedJanuary 24, 2013
Alert CodeTA09-088A

### Systems Affected

* Microsoft Windows

### Overview

US-CERT is aware of public reports indicating a widespread infection of the Conficker/Downadup worm, which can infect a Microsoft Windows system from a thumb drive, a network share, or directly across a corporate network, if the network servers are not patched with the [MS08-067](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS08-067.mspx) patch from Microsoft.

Researchers have discovered a new variant of the Conficker Worm on April 9, 2009.  This variant updates earlier infections via its peer to peer (P2P) network as well as resuming scan-and-infect activity against unpatched systems. Public reporting indicates that this variant attempts to download additional malicious code onto victim systems, possibly including copies of the Waledac Trojan, a spam-oriented malicious application which has previously propagated only via bogus email messages containing malicious links.

Home users can apply a simple test for the presence of a Conficker/Downadup infection on their home computers.  The presence of a Conficker/Downadup infection may be detected if a user is unable to surf to their security solution website or if they are unable to connect to the websites, by downloading detection/removal tools available free from those sites:

* <http://www.symantec.com/norton/theme.jsp?themeid=conficker_worm&inid=us_ghp_link_conficker_worm>
* <http://www.microsoft.com/protect/computer/viruses/worms/conficker.mspx>
* <http://www.mcafee.com>

If a user is unable to reach any of these websites, it may indicate a Conficker/Downadup infection.  The most recent variant of Conficker/Downadup interferes with queries for these sites, preventing a user from visiting them.  If a Conficker/Downadup infection is suspected, the system or computer should be removed from the network or unplugged from the Internet - in the case for home users.

### Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Solution

Instructions, support and more information on how to manually remove a Conficker/Downadup infection from a system have been published by major security vendors.  Please see below for a few of those sites. Each of these vendors offers free tools that can verify the presence of a Conficker/Downadup infection and remove the worm:

Symantec:

<http://www.symantec.com/business/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2009-011316-0247-99>

Microsoft:

<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/962007>

<http://www.microsoft.com/protect/computer/viruses/worms/conficker.mspx>

Microsoft PC Safety hotline at 1-866-PCSAFETY, for assistance.

US-CERT encourages users to take the following preventative measures to help prevent a Conficker/Downadup infection:

* Ensure all systems have the [MS08-067](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS08-067.mspx) patch.
* Disable AutoRun functionality. See US-CERT Technical Cyber Security Alert [TA09-020A](/ncas/alerts/TA09-020A.html).
* Maintain up-to-date [antivirus](/ncas/tips/ST04-005.html) software.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Microsoft Windows Server - Code Execution (PoC) (MS08-067)

#### EDB-ID:

###### 6824

#### CVE:

###### [2008-4250](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-4250)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [stephen lawler](/?author=1447)

#### Type:

###### [dos](/?type=dos)

---

#### Platform:

###### [Windows](/?platform=windows)

#### Date:

###### 2008-10-23

---

**Vulnerable App:**

```
In vstudio command prompt:

  mk.bat

next:

  attach debugger to services.exe (2k) or the relevant svchost (xp/2k3/...)

  net use \\IPADDRESS\IPC$ /user:user creds
  die \\IPADDRESS \pipe\srvsvc

  In some cases, /user:"" "", will suffice (i.e., anonymous connection)

You should get EIP -> 00 78 00 78, a stack overflow (like a guard page
violation), access violation, etc.  However, in some cases, you will get
nothing.

This is because it depends on the state of the stack prior to the "overflow".
You need a slash on the stack prior to the input buffer.

So play around a bit, you'll get it working reliably...

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Microsoft Server service RPC stack buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#827267

Original Release Date: 2008-10-23 | Last Revised: 2009-11-02

---

### Overview

A stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows Server service may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

### Description

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

## Server Service Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4250

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Server service on Windows systems. The vulnerability is due to the service not properly handling specially crafted RPC requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-4250](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4250).

#### Mitigating Factors for Server Service Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4250

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect network resources from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the vulnerable code path is only accessible to authenticated users. This vulnerability is not liable to be triggered if the attacker is not authenticated.

#### Workarounds for Server Service Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4250

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable the Server and Computer Browser services**

  Disabling the Computer Browser and Server service on the affected systems will help protect systems from remote attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  You can disable these services by using the following steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel** (or point to **Settings** and then click **Control Panel**).
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **Computer Browser Service**.
  5. In the Startup type list, click **Disabled**.
  6. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Repeat steps 4-6 for the **Server** service

  **Impact of Workaround**. If the Computer Browser service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Computer Browser service may log an error message in the system event log. For more information about the Computer Browser service, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 188001](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/188001). If the Server service is disabled, you will not be able to share files or printers from your computer. However, you will still be able to view and use file shares and printer resources on other systems.

  **How to undo the workaround.** You can enable these services by using the following steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel** (or point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**).
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **Computer Browser Service**.
  5. In the Startup type list, click **Automatic**.
  6. Click **Start**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Repeat steps 4-6 for the **Server** service
* **On Windows** **Vista** **and Windows Server 2008, filter the affected RPC identifier**

  In addition to blocking ports with the Windows Firewall, the Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 editions can selectively filter RPC Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID). To prevent this vulnerability, add a rule that blocks all RPC requests with the UUID equal to 4b324fc8-1670-01d3-1278-5a47bf6ee188. This is accomplished through the network shell. To access the network shell, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  netsh

  ```

  Once in the netsh environment, enter the following commands:

  ```
  netsh>rpc
  netsh rpc>filter
  netsh rpc filter>add rule layer=um actiontype=block
  netsh rpc filter>add condition field=if_uuid matchtype=equal data=4b324fc8-1670-01d3-1278-5a47bf6ee188
  netsh rpc filter>add filter
  netsh rpc filter>quit

  ```

  The Filter Key is a randomly generated UUID specific to each system. To confirm the filter is in place, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  netsh rpc filter show filter

  ```

  If the commands are successful, the system displays the following information:

  ```
  Listing all RPC Filters.
  ---------------------------------
  filterKey: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
  displayData.name: RPCFilter
  displayData.description: RPC Filter
  filterId: 0x12f79
  layerKey: um
  weight: Type: FWP_EMPTY Value: Empty
  action.type: block
  numFilterConditions: 1

  ```

  Where **filterKey:** ***xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx*** equates to the randomly generated UUID relevant to your system.

  **Impact of workaround.** Certain applications that rely on the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol may not function as intended. However, you will still be able to view and use file shares and printer resources on other systems.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Run the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  netsh rpc filter delete filter xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

  ```

  Where **filterKey:** ***xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx*** equates to the randomly generated UUID relevant to your system.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the Internet Connection Firewall**

  All supported editions of Windows Vista come with Windows Firewall, a two-way firewall that is automatically enabled.

  For all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, use the Internet Connection Firewall feature to help protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet. In Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3, this feature is called the Windows Firewall.

  By default, the Windows Firewall feature in Windows XP helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.

  To enable the Windows Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Network Connections** and then click **Change Windows Firewall Settings**.
  3. On the **General** tab, ensure that the **On (recommended)** value is selected. This will enable the Windows Firewall.
  4. Once the Windows Firewall is enabled, select **Donât allow exceptions** to prohibit all incoming traffic.

  For Windows Server 2003 systems, configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection using the following steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.

#### FAQ for Server Service Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4250

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. On Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 systems, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability over RPC without authentication to run arbitrary code. It is possible that this vulnerability could be used in the crafting of a wormable exploit. If successfully exploited, an attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the Windows Server service not properly handling specially crafted RPC requests.

**What is the Server service?**

The Server service provides RPC support, file and print support, and named pipe sharing over the network. The Server service allows the sharing of your local resources (such as disks and printers) so that other users on the network can access them. It also allows named pipe communication between applications running on other computers and your computer, which is used for RPC.

**What is RPC?**

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that a program can use to request a service from a program located on another computer in a network. RPC helps with interoperability because the program using RPC does not have to understand the network protocols that are supporting communication. In RPC, the requesting program is the client and the service-providing program is the server.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message to an affected system. On Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 systems, any anonymous user with access to the target network could deliver a specially crafted network packet to the affected system in order to exploit this vulnerability. On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 systems, however, only an authenticated user with access to the target network could deliver a specially crafted network packet to the affected system in order to exploit this vulnerability.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

While all workstations and servers are at risk regarding this issue, systems running Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003 are primarily at risk due to the unique characteristics of the vulnerability and affected code path.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Server service handles RPC requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability. However, when the security bulletin was released, Microsoft had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published.

**Does applying this security update help protect customers from the code that attempts to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. This security update addresses the vulnerability that is currently being exploited. The vulnerability that has been addressed has been assigned the Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2008-4250](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4250).

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
