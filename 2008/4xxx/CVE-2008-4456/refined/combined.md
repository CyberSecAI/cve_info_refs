How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# MySQL command-line client HTML injection vulnerability

### Description

The mysql command-line client does not quote HTML special characters like < in its output. This allows an attacker who is able to write data into a table to hide or modify records in the output, and to inject potentially dangerous code, e. g. Javascript to perform cross-site scripting or cross-site request forgery attacks.

### How to reproduce

`$ mysql --html --execute "select '<a>'" ...

<TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TH><a></TH></TR><TR><TD><a></TD></TR></TABLE>`

### Affected versions

All.

### Resolution

Users are advised to install the available patch from [http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=27884](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=27884 "MySQL Bugs: #27884: mysql --html does not quote HTML special characters in output").

### Workaround

If another resolution is not feasible, users are advised to modify their SELECT statements to filter out the characters < and &:

`SELECT REPLACE(REPLACE(...,'&','&amp;'),'<','&lt;') AS ...;`

This workaround is incompatible with the described resolution and should be reversed after installation of the patch.

### Timeline

2007-04-17 Opened bug on mysql.com

2008-05-01 Patch available

### Resources

The bug is filed on [http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=27884](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=27884 "MySQL Bugs: #27884: mysql --html does not quote HTML special characters in output").

This advisory is available from [https://henlich.de/it-security/mysql-command-line-client-html-injection-vulnerability/](https://henlich.de/it-security/mysql-command-line-client-html-injection-vulnerability/ "MySQL command-line client HTML injection vulnerability").

Package        : mysql-dfsg-5.0
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-3963 CVE-2008-4456
Debian Bug     : 498362

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified affecting MySQL, a
relational database server, and its associated interactive client
application.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following two problems:

CVE-2008-3963

    Kay Roepke reported that the MySQL server would not properly handle
    an empty bit-string literal in an SQL statement, allowing an
    authenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (a crash)
    in mysqld.  This issue affects the oldstable distribution (etch), but
    not the stable distribution (lenny).

CVE-2008-4456

    Thomas Henlich reported that the MySQL commandline client application
    did not encode HTML special characters when run in HTML output mode
    (that is, "mysql --html ...").  This could potentially lead to
    cross-site scripting or unintended script privilege escalation if
    the resulting output is viewed in a browser or incorporated into
    a web site.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch10.

For the stable distribution (lenny),  these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.51a-24+lenny1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

* [mysql-dfsg-5.1](/security/cves?package=mysql-dfsg-5.1) -

## Details

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table

files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use the DATA

DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly bypass privilege checks.

This update alters table creation behaviour by disallowing the use of the

MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 8.10. ([CVE-2008-4098](/security/CVE-2008-4098))

It was discovered that MySQL contained a cross-site scripting vulnerability

in the command-line client when the --html option is enabled. An attacker

could place arbitrary web script or html in a database cell, which would

then get placed in the html document output by the command-line tool. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04.

([CVE-2008-4456](/security/CVE-2008-4456))

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table

files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use symlinks

combined with the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly

bypass privilege checks. This issue only affected Ubuntu 9.10.

([CVE-2008-7247](/security/CVE-2008-7247))

It was discovered that MySQL contained multiple format string flaws when

logging database creation and deletion. An authenticated user could use

specially crafted database names to make MySQL crash, causing a denial of

service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04.

([CVE-2009-2446](/security/CVE-2009-2446))

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled errors when performing

certain SELECT statements, and did not preserve correct flags when

performing statements that use the GeomFromWKB function. An authenticated

user could exploit this to make MySQL crash, causing a denial of service.

([CVE-2009-4019](/security/CVE-2009-4019))

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly checked symlinks when using the

DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. A local user could use symlinks

to create tables that pointed to tables known to be created at a later

time, bypassing access restrictions. ([CVE-2009-4030](/security/CVE-2009-4030))

It was discovered that MySQL contained a buffer overflow when parsing

ssl certificates. A remote attacker could send crafted requests and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue did not

affect Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and the default compiler options for affected

releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. In the

default installation, attackers would also be isolated by the AppArmor

MySQL profile. ([CVE-2009-4484](/security/CVE-2009-4484))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RE: RE: MySQL command-line client HTML injection vulnerability

Hi,

So, should we bring up all patches that have been released 5 months ago
or thereabouts?  There's been a LOT of serious vulnerabilities released
since then - if you're 5 months behind in patching, then there's more
serious questions than this one patch.

We ALL need to keep up to date with patches.  5 month old patches are
ancient news and should have been taken care of no more than about 4
months ago at the most.  If this list were to make mention of all old
patches after 5 months or so, the list would be flooded with nigh on
useless information taking the bandwidth as compared to new, relevant
patch and vulnerability. information.

Description:
The mysql command-line client does not quote HTML special characters like & < > " in its output. This allows an attacker who is able to write data into a table to inject potentially dangerous code, e. g. Javascript, into the output.

How to repeat:
c:\> mysql --html -execute "select '<a>'"

<TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TH><a></TH></TR><TR><TD><a></TD></TR></TABLE>

Suggested fix:
The quoting of special characters should be the same as for XML output, e. g.:
c:\> mysql --xml -execute "select 'b<a>'"

<?xml version="1.0"?>

<resultset statement="select 'b&lt;a&gt;'
">
  <row>
	<field name="b&lt;a&gt;">b&lt;a&gt;</field>
  </row>
</resultset>
```

The option should read --execute and not -execute

This is queued for 5.1 but will it be fixed in 5.0? There was a lot of customer demand in this as well as the fact it had a CVE, even if the impact is probably reasonably low.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
