# [XSS vulnerability in 0.804](https://www.flatpress.org/2008/09/25/xss-vulnerability-in-0804/)

Today [Fabian Fingerle](http://www.fabian-fingerle.de "Go to http://www.fabian-fingerle.de") kindly contacted me to tell me about two nasty XSS bugs that slipped in FP0.804 (stable)

Image does not exist: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1076/724682692\_c99b632f15\_m.jpg

The fix were trivial, and if you donâ€™t want to download a whole new package, just overwrite

* [fp-interface/sharedtpls/login.tpl](http://flatpress.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/flatpress/branches/0.804-vivace/fp-interface/sharedtpls/login.tpl?revision=188 "Go to http://flatpress.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/flatpress/branches/0.804-vivace/fp-interface/sharedtpls/login.tpl?revision=188")
* [fp-interface/sharedtpls/contact.tpl](http://flatpress.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/flatpress/branches/0.804-vivace/fp-interface/sharedtpls/contact.tpl?revision=187 "Go to http://flatpress.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/flatpress/branches/0.804-vivace/fp-interface/sharedtpls/contact.tpl?revision=187")

with those linked.

Iâ€™ll take this occasion to release a bugfix package, with the fixes you can find on the SVN stable branch (like feed validation and such).

You can [get it from SourceForge.net](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=157089 "Go to http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=157089") as usual.

The new version is **0.804.1**, svn rev.189

Thank you, Fabian

   Thank you for fixing this XSS bugs. And thank you for the 0.804.1 release.

   Last week Iâ€™m working on a new german language pack, which includes many changes, also my own scribal errors. Itâ€™s now available in the Flatpress Wiki.
