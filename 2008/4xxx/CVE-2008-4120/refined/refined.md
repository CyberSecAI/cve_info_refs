Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4120:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the FlatPress blogging engine. Specifically, the `user`, `pass`, and `name` fields in the `login.php` and `contact.php` forms were not being sanitized before being rendered on the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. Malicious JavaScript can be injected into the vulnerable input fields.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Stealing of user's cookies or other sensitive data

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through specially crafted POST requests to the `login.php` and `contact.php` pages.
*   An attacker could craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the vulnerable parameters (`user`, `pass`, and `name`). This URL could then be distributed via social media, email, etc.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted POST requests to the vulnerable pages.
*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, allowing for remote exploitation.
