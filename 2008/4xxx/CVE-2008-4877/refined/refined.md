Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4877 (Note: The exploit-db entry lists both CVE-2008-4878 and CVE-2008-4877. This analysis focuses on the information provided, which seems primarily related to a vulnerability identified as CVE-2008-4877)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the admin login page of WebCards 1.3 and prior versions. The vulnerability arises from improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the username field, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw that allows the attacker to manipulate SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Authentication Bypass: An attacker can bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the administration area without valid credentials.
- Remote Code Execution: Once inside the administration panel, the attacker can upload a shell, potentially achieving remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP request to admin login page

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to know or guess the path to the WebCards admin login page (e.g., `http://site.com/webcards/admin.php`).
- The attacker needs to be able to submit HTTP requests to this page
- The attacker needs to know or guess a valid username (default is "admin").
- The target server settings (such as magic quotes) should be configured in such a way that allows the exploitation of the sql injection.
