Subject: libxml2 "ampproblem" DoS

Hey,

I did not look into this issue closely yet, but I can reproduce an OOM
situation on libxml2 2.7.1, but not on 2.6.32.

The malicious XML file can be found on
<http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=554660>

I'm not sure if and how this is related to CVE-2008-3281.

Robert

# libxml2: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200812-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libxml2 might lead to execution of arbitrary
code or Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libxml2** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.7.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.7.2-r1** |

### Background

libxml2 is the XML (eXtended Markup Language) C parser and toolkit
initially developed for the Gnome project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were reported in libxml2:

* Andreas Solberg reported that libxml2 does not properly detect
  recursion during entity expansion in an attribute value
  (CVE-2008-3281).
* A heap-based buffer overflow has been reported in the
  xmlParseAttValueComplex() function in parser.c (CVE-2008-3529).
* Christian Weiske reported that predefined entity definitions in
  entities are not properly handled (CVE-2008-4409).
* Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported an integer overflow in the
  xmlBufferResize() function that can lead to an infinite loop
  (CVE-2008-4225).
* Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported an integer overflow in the
  xmlSAX2Characters() function leading to a memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-4226).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to open a
specially crafted XML document with an application using libxml2,
possibly resulting in the exeution of arbitrary code or a high CPU and
memory consumption.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libxml2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.7.2-r1"
```
