Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4086:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `site` parameter of the `index.php` script within Reciprocal Links Manager 1.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `site` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** An attacker can manipulate database queries to extract sensitive information (user credentials, other data), modify data, or potentially gain administrative access to the application, and possibly the underlying system, depending on the database permissions. In this specific exploit example, `user(), version(), database()` are being used to obtain information about the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` script.
- **Malicious Input:** The attack exploits the `site` parameter by injecting a SQL payload such as ` -1+union+select+concat_ws(user(),version(),database())--`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability is exposed to unauthenticated users, allowing for remote exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates a basic information gathering attack using a SQL injection vulnerability, specifically a UNION-based injection.
- The exploit targets the `index.php` script, specifically using the `open` command.
- The exploit confirms that the vulnerability exists in Reciprocal Links Manager version 1.1.
- The exploit also demonstrates how to extract database information using `concat_ws` function.
