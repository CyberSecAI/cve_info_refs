The provided content relates to CVE-2008-4903.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The feedback system is vulnerable to XSS. Malicious script code can be injected into the "Name" and "Website" fields when posting a new comment. This code is executed in the context of the admin user when viewed in the admin panel. The website parameter is also executed when normal users view the blog post.

*   **SQL Injection:** The "Manage pages" section of the administration panel is vulnerable to SQL injection. The `published_at` parameter is not properly sanitized due to an incorrect regular expression. This vulnerability requires "Blog publisher" rights to exploit.

*   **Insecure Password Hashing:** The application uses a hardcoded salt value when storing password hashes, making the salt less effective. This results in identical hashes for identical passwords, weakening password security.

**Root Cause:**

*   **XSS:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the feedback system.
*   **SQL Injection:** Inadequate input validation and incorrect regular expressions in the "Manage pages" functionality.
*   **Insecure Password Hashing:** Usage of a hardcoded salt instead of a unique, randomly generated salt for each user.

**Impact:**

*   **XSS:** Allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
*   **Insecure Password Hashing:** Weakens password security, making password cracking easier via rainbow table attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** Injecting malicious code into the "Name" and "Website" fields of comments.
*   **SQL Injection:** Manipulating the `published_at` parameter in the "Manage pages" section of the admin panel.
*   **Insecure Password Hashing:** By gaining access to the hashed passwords, they can be easily cracked due to the lack of an appropriate salt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to post comments on the blog.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs "Blog publisher" rights.
*   **Insecure Password Hashing:** The attacker needs to gain access to the hashed passwords.
