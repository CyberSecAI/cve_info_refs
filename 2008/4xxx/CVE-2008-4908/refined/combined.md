How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: The possibility of attack with the help of symlinks in some Debian packages
Date: Sun, 24 Aug 2008 22:05:28 +0400
```
Package: crossfire-maps
Severity: grave

Hi, maintainer!

This message about the error concerns a few packages  at  once.   I've
tested all the packages (for Lenny) on my Debian mirror.  All  scripts
of packages (marked as executable) were tested.

In some packages I've discovered scripts with errors which may be used
by a user for damaging important system files or user's files.

For example if a script uses in its work a temp file which is  created
in /tmp directory, then every user can create symlink  with  the  same
name in this directory in order to  destroy  or  rewrite  some  system
or user file.  Symlink attack may also  lead  not  only  to  the  data
desctruction but to denial of service as well.

Even if you create files or directories with help of function 'RANDOM'
or pid(), then your system is not protected. Attacker can create many
symlinks in order to destroy your data or create 'denial  of  service'
for your package scripts.

Even if you make rm(dir) for files/directories, then  your  system  is
not protected. Attacker can permanently create symlinks.

This list is created with the help of script.  This list is sorted  by
hand. Howewer in some cases mistake is possible.

Please, Be understanding to possible mistakes. :)

I set Severity into grave for this bug. The table of discovered
problems is below.

severity 496358 important
thanks

The vulnerable script in this package is
/usr/share/games/crossfire/maps/Info/combine.pl, which is not used by
default; it's provided only as a utility for possible use.  I don't think
this should be considered grave.
