Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4484

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper conditional check in `main.php` of Crux Gallery. The code bypasses authentication checks when the `name` parameter in a GET request equals `users`, regardless of the validity of the user's cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application relies on cookie values (`user`, `pass`) for authentication, but this check is easily bypassed.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The conditional logic allows unauthorized access to the admin panel by manipulating the GET request parameters.
*  **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the `name` parameter in the GET request.
*   **GET request misuse:** The application fails to sanitize the GET request parameters and does not require a POST request for sensitive operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to the admin panel without proper authentication.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers effectively gain administrative privileges to the application.
*   **Full Application Control:** Given the administrative access, an attacker can make changes to the gallery, including modifying the admin password.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a GET request to `index.php` with a specific `name` parameter (`name=users`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require any prior access or credentials to exploit the vulnerability. They can exploit this from any network location.
*   **Basic Web Interaction:** Only a web browser or a tool capable of crafting HTTP requests is necessary for the attack.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerable code is within `main.php`.
* The vulnerable parameter is `name` in the GET request.
* The vulnerability can be exploited to view the main admin panel or change the admin password by sending requests like `http://site/index.php?op=admin&name=users` and `http://site/index.php?op=pass&name=users`.
* The issue is present in Crux Gallery version 1.32 and earlier.
* The Secunia advisory for this vulnerability is 32058.
* The vulnerability is classified as CWE-264, which is "Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls."
* CVSS score is 6.8 (Medium).
