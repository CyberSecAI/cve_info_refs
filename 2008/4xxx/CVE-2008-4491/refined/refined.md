Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Apple Mail.app's behavior of storing draft S/MIME encrypted emails in clear text on the server when the "Store draft messages on the server" option is enabled for IMAP or Exchange accounts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Clear Text Storage:**  The primary vulnerability is the storage of S/MIME encrypted email drafts in unencrypted form on the server. This defeats the purpose of end-to-end encryption provided by S/MIME.
*   **Configuration Default:** The "Store draft messages on the server" option is enabled by default, which makes users more susceptible to the vulnerability unless they change it manually.
*   **False Sense of Security:** Users may assume that their emails are protected by S/MIME encryption even when drafts are stored on the server, leading to a false sense of security.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Unauthorized access to the server by a malicious actor would reveal the contents of supposedly encrypted email drafts.
*   **Violation of Privacy:** The assumption that no one except the sender and recipient can access encrypted email content is violated.
*   **Compromised Security:** Man-in-the-middle attacks on email content become possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Server Access:** An attacker needs access to the email server where the drafts are stored. This could involve compromising the server directly, or accessing it with stolen credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the server where email drafts are stored. This could be a direct breach of the server, having stolen credentials for a valid user, or by gaining access through other means.
*   No additional requirements from the attacker's side are mentioned by the source.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Apple in August 2008, with a response indicating that a complete solution would involve significant architectural changes.
*   Mozilla Thunderbird was cited as a contrasting case because it encrypts draft messages before sending them to the server.
*   The identified workaround is disabling the "Store draft messages on the server" setting and implementing a local power backup system to prevent data loss due to power outages.
