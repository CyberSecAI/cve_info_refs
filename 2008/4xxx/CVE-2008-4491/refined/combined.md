Apple's Mail.app stores your S/MIME encrypted emails in clear text
Date published: 2008-10-03
Affected version: 3.5 (929.4/929.2)
Unaffected version: Unknown
Summary:
Apple Mail.app does not store S/MIME encrypted emails securely in the
Drafts directory on server.
Impact:
The assumption that the server does not have access to the email
content is violated.
Description:
Apple's Mail.app is the default email application that comes with Mac
OS X machines. It supports S/MIME as standard for encryption and
authentication of emails. However by default Mail.app also has an
option called "Store draft messages on the server" when you are making
use of an IMAP or Exchange server.
The assumption when making use of S/MIME is that no one except you and
the recipient of the email can view your encrypted email - end to end
encryption. Emails are stored in encrypted form on the server and
therefore should not be read by anyone having access to the email
server, thus preventing Man in the Middle
attacks. What the "Store draft messages on the server" option does is
store a clear text version of the email, until the email is sent.
The problem with this option is that it defies the assumption that the
email is encrypted on the server. This can therefore lead to a false
sense of security and information leakage, which is exactly what
people making use of S/MIME want to prevent.
Solution:
Go to the Preferences and select the account from the accounts tab
Select the "Mailbox behaviors" tab
Uncheck the option "Store draft messages on the server"
Finally, make use of a UPS or similar technology to prevent loosing
your unsaved emails in case of a power interruption or failure.
Mozilla's Thunderbird on Mac OS X is not vulnerable by encrypting the
drafts before they are sent to server. This may also be a way to
mitigate this issue without sacrificing usage of the "Drafts" folder.
Timeline:
Aug 14, 2008: Initial email to Apple's security contact
product-security@apple.com
Aug 15, 2008: Was assigned a follow-up id and the security team asked
me for more information.
Aug 17, 2008: Provided full information and explained that this
security issue defies the assumption that with S/MIME email is stored
securely on the server.
Sep 11, 2008: Sent a follow-up email to the Apple security team
without any response
Sep 16, 2008: Another attempt to contact the Apple security team.
Sep 19, 2008: Received a response from Apple letting me know that: "A
complete solution for the issue may involve significant architectural
changes, so at this time it's difficult to estimate the timeframe or
release vehicle for a fix."

We’re excited to announce the release of our latest white paper, “DTLS ‘ClientHello’ Race Conditions in WebRTC Implementations”. This comprehensive study delves into a critical vulnerability affecting various WebRTC implementations, with potential implications for real-time communication security.
Our research team at Enable Security conducted extensive testing on both open-source and proprietary WebRTC implementations, focusing on media servers and popular communication platforms. The study aimed to identify vulnerabilities related to the processing of DTLS ClientHello messages in WebRTC sessions.…

This week, I had the pleasure of joining Alan Quayle on the TADSummit Innovators Podcast to review the last six months of VoIP and WebRTC security news. We delved into some of the most intriguing trends emerging in the RTC security space.
We covered the following RTC security trends for 2024 so far:
Increasing focus on WebRTC vulnerabilities and security Growing concern over VoIP and conferencing platform security Emerging threats from AI and machine learning in audio manipulation Growing importance of resilience in communication systems SMS/Voice 2FA is hugely problematic Here are the top 10 insights that emerged from our discussion:…

*[asterisk](https://www.enablesecurity.com/tags/asterisk/)*

Executive summary (TL;DR) A critical denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability has been identified in media servers that process WebRTC’s DTLS-SRTP, specifically in their handling of ClientHello messages. This vulnerability arises from a race condition between ICE and DTLS traffic and can be exploited to disrupt media sessions, compromising the availability of real-time communication services. Mitigations include filtering packets based on ICE-validated IP and port combinations. The article also indicates safe testing methods and strategies for detecting the attack.…

We just pushed out a new SIPVicious PRO update to our subscribing members! This version does not include any new major features. Instead, it fixes various bugs and brings missing but necessary features to various SIPVicious PRO tools. We have the following highlights in this update:
Documentation now includes realistic Gitlab CI/CD examples The RTP fuzzer in the experimental version now supports SRTP Support for new SIP DoS flood request methods The RTP inject tool can now specify the RTP’s SSRC and payload ID The SIP password cracking tool now supports closing the connection upon each attempt The SIP ping utility supports INVITE For the boring details, including a list of bug fixes, do read the release notes for v6.…

*[research](https://www.enablesecurity.com/tags/research/)*

Executive summary (TL;DR) The combination of pseudo-variables and Kamailio’s exec can be risky and may result in code injection. By using special SIP headers and environment variables, it becomes effortless to exploit a vulnerable configuration. We have created a Docker environment to assist readers in reproducing this vulnerability and testing solutions. Protection is tricky and the official documentation may have previously misled developers - we aim to fix that by updating the module’s official documentation.…

## [How to perform a DDoS attack simulation](https://www.enablesecurity.com/blog/how-to-perform-ddos-simulation/)

Published on Nov 29, 2022

TL;DR A DDoS simulation is a practical exercise that various organisations are capable of doing. Understand the reasons why you would want to do this, then combine custom with off-the-shelf attack tools. Follow the best practices, apply solutions and mitigation; and you can finally answer: what if we got attacked?
Introduction In this post, we give an overview of how you too can perform your own distributed denial of service (DDoS) simulation exercises.…

We just made two builds available to our SIPVicious PRO members. One is called the stable build, while the other is the experimental build. The v6.0.0-beta.5 stable build includes a large number of fixes, much better (or sane) defaults and full coverage of SRTP throughout the toolset.
The experimental version is where the excitement is. Our members now have access to 5 new tools that we find useful in our work:…
