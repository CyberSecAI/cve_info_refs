  "CVE-2008-4064": {
    "description": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird related to graphics rendering. Specifically, it's an integer overflow in `nsSVGFEGaussianBlurElement::SetupPredivide` when processing SVG files, triggered by a large `stdDeviation` value in the `feGaussianBlur` filter. This can lead to memory corruption and a crash.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the calculation of buffer size within `nsSVGFEGaussianBlurElement::SetupPredivide`.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow",
       "Heap buffer overflow",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Crash, potential for arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "Opening a specially crafted SVG file",
       "Malicious website with a crafted SVG file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to open a specially crafted SVG file or visit a malicious page containing the malicious SVG file. No specific user privileges are needed.",
    "additional_information": "The issue was initially reported to security@mozilla.org by Drew Yao from Apple Product Security. The vulnerability was present in Firefox 3.0 and was fixed by adding a check to avoid the overflow. It was also mentioned that the code was removed and replaced with a better approach in trunk builds."
