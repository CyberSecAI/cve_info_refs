{
  "CVE-2008-4252": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The DataGrid ActiveX control for Visual Basic 6 is vulnerable to memory corruption when used in Internet Explorer, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Memory corruption vulnerability in the DataGrid ActiveX control"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the logged-on user, potentially gaining full control over the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted web page that invokes the vulnerable ActiveX control through Internet Explorer. Attackers can host malicious websites or inject malicious content into compromised or user-content accepting websites. Users must be convinced to visit these sites.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website or compromise existing sites to inject malicious code. They must then convince users to visit these sites, typically through phishing or social engineering techniques."

      "Memory corruption vulnerability in the FlexGrid ActiveX control"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, gaining the same user rights as the logged-on user, which could lead to full control of the system.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited via specially crafted web pages that are designed to invoke the vulnerable ActiveX control through Internet Explorer. Attackers can host malicious sites or inject the malicious content into existing sites. Users must be convinced to visit these websites.",

  "CVE-2008-4255": {
     "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Windows Common ActiveX control for Visual Basic 6 has a vulnerability due to an allocation error during the parsing of a specially crafted AVI file. This error can lead to memory corruption that allows arbitrary code execution.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Memory corruption vulnerability due to allocation error while parsing AVI files"

  "CVE-2008-3704": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Masked Edit ActiveX Control for Visual Basic 6 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to incorrect handling of property values when used in Internet Explorer, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Buffer overflow vulnerability in the Masked Edit ActiveX control"
    ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user, potentially taking complete control of the affected system.",
