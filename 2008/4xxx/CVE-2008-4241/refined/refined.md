{
  "CVE-2008-4241": {
    "description": "CJ Ultra Plus <= v1.0.4 is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'SID' cookie.",
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within the 'SID' cookie before using it in a SQL query.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive data, modification of data, or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the 'SID' cookie."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to set the 'SID' cookie value when sending a request to the web application. No special privileges or access to the server are required.",
        "details": "The provided exploit targets the 'SID' cookie, using a crafted SQL query (`UNION SELECT b12 from settings/*`) to extract the admin hash. The exploit highlights that the salt for DES encryption might vary, but typically 'aa' is used and the application is vulnerable by not sanitizing the cookie input."
