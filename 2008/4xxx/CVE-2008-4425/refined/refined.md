  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-4425",
      "root_cause": "The `upload.php` script allows arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient input validation.",
      "vulnerabilities": [

         "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server. Additionally, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser via XSS.",
