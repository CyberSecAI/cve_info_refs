Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4900:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `classifiedsblaster.php` script of YourFreeWorld Classifieds Blaster.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in the `tr.php` script. The application does not properly sanitize or validate user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords (as demonstrated by the provided exploit which retrieves the `Username` and `Password` from the `adminsettings` table).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to `tr.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of SQL to craft a malicious SQL injection query.

**Exploit Details:**

*   The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `adminsettings` table.
*   The exploit uses `concat()` to combine the username and password with a separator (`0x3a` which represents a colon).
*   The exploit appends `--` to comment out the remainder of the original SQL query.

**Additional Notes**
*   The exploit provides the vulnerable application's URL
*   It also includes the vulnerable parameter `id`
*   It details the specific SQL injection payload
*   The exploit specifies the targeted table name `adminsettings` and columns `Username`, `Password`.

In summary, the provided content provides a detailed look at a SQL injection vulnerability in YourFreeWorld Classifieds Blaster, including how it can be exploited to extract sensitive information.
