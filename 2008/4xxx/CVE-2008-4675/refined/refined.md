```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the 'name' parameter in the `index.php` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data leakage, modification, or deletion. In this exploit, it is used to extract database information (database name, user, version)",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a malicious SQL injection payload in the 'name' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required."
