```
{
  "Root cause": "The `asciiview` script in `aview` creates temporary files in the `/tmp` directory using a predictable filename pattern (`/tmp/aview$$.pgm`), making it vulnerable to symlink attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Insecure temporary file creation leading to a symlink vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can create a symlink with the same name as the temporary file, causing the `asciiview` script to overwrite arbitrary files on the system with the privileges of the user running the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local symlink attack.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to create symlinks in the `/tmp` directory."
