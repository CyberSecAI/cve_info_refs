How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. Privilege escalation on 64-bit guest operating systems
VMware products emulate hardware functions, like CPU, Memory, and IO.
A flaw in VMware's CPU hardware emulation could allow the virtual CPU to jump to an incorrect memory address. Exploitation of this issue on the guest operating system does not lead to a compromise of the host system but could lead to a privilege escalation on guest operating system. An attacker would need to have a user account on the guest operating system.
Affected
64-bit Windows and 64-bit FreeBSD guest operating systems and possibly other 64-bit operating systems. The issue does not affect the 64-bit versions of Linux guest operating systems.
VMware would like to thank Derek Soeder for discovering this issue and working with us on its remediation.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4279 this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

#####

b. Update for VirtualCenter fixes a potential information disclosure
This release resolves an issue where a user's password could be displayed in cleartext. When logging into VirtualCenter Server 2.0 with Virtual Infrastructure Client 2.5, the user password might be displayed if it contains certain special characters. The dialog box displaying the password can appear in front or hidden behind other windows.
To remediate this issue the VirtualCenter client installations must be updated after updating to VirtualCenter Update 3
VMware would like to thank Mark Woollatt for reporting this issue to VMware.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4278 to this issue.

 Notes: These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely only if the attacker has access to the Service Console network. Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the Service Console be isolated from the VM network. Please see [www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726) for more information on VMware security best practices.

 The currently installed version of JRE depends on your patch deployment history.

3. Problem Description

  a.  Privilege escalation on 64-bit guest operating systems

    VMware products emulate hardware functions, like CPU, Memory, and
    IO.

    A flaw in VMware's CPU hardware emulation could allow the
    virtual CPU to jump to an incorrect memory address. Exploitation of
    this issue on the guest operating system does not lead to a
    compromise of the host system but could lead to a privilege
    escalation on guest operating system.  An attacker would need to
    have a user account on the guest operating system.

    Affected
    64-bit Windows and 64-bit FreeBSD guest operating systems and
    possibly other 64-bit operating systems. The issue does not
    affect the 64-bit versions of Linux guest operating systems.

    VMware would like to thank Derek Soeder for discovering
    this issue and working with us on its remediation.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-4279 this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    NOTE: The set of guest operating systems which is affected by
          this issue is a subset of 64-bit operating systems
          (see above for details)

 b. Update for VirtualCenter fixes a potential information disclosure

   This release resolves an issue where a user's password could be
   displayed in cleartext. When logging into VirtualCenter Server 2.0
   with Virtual Infrastructure Client 2.5, the user password might be
   displayed if it contains certain special characters. The dialog
   box displaying the password can appear in front or hidden behind
   other windows.

   To remediate this issue the VirtualCenter client installations must
   be updated after updating to VirtualCenter Update 3

   VMware would like to thank Mark Woollatt for reporting this issue
   to VMware.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
   has assigned the name CVE-2008-4278 to this issue.

 Notes: These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely only if the
        attacker has access to the Service Console network.
        Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the
        Service Console be isolated from the VM network. Please see
        <http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726> for more
        information on VMware security best practices.

        The currently installed version of JRE depends on your patch
        deployment history.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
