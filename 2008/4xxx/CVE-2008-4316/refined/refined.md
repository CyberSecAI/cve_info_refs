**Summary:**
The provided documents describe a heap overflow vulnerability in the base64 encoding and decoding functions of the GLib library, as well as in several other applications that predated GLib and used similar flawed code. This vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow when calculating the allocation size, which can lead to a heap buffer overflow and potential arbitrary code execution.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow during memory allocation calculation. The allocation size is calculated as `user_supplied_length * 3 / 4 + some_small_num`. Due to the order of operations, the multiplication by 3 is performed before division by 4, which can result in an integer overflow if `user_supplied_length` is large enough. This leads to a smaller-than-expected allocation size, causing a heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow. When encoding or decoding large base64 strings, the program allocates less memory than required due to the integer overflow. When data is written into the undersized buffer, a heap buffer overflow occurs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable process.
- Remote code execution is possible if the vulnerable function is used to process data from the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing of large base64 encoded strings by a vulnerable application or library
- Specifically crafted base64 strings to trigger integer overflow in memory allocation calculation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to control or influence the length of the base64 encoded data that is processed by the vulnerable application.
- If the vulnerable application processes network data, a remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted network traffic.

**Affected Software:**
- glib >= 2.11 unstable
- glib >= 2.12 stable
- gstreamer-plugins-base < 0.10.23
- libsoup < 2.2.x

- OpenSUSE 10.3, 11.0, and 11.1
- SLE 11
- Debian etch and lenny
- Ubuntu 7.10, 8.04, 8.10

**Patched Software:**
- glib >= 2.20 (svn revision >= 7973)
- gstreamer-plugins-base >= 0.10.23
- libsoup >= 2.2.x, >= 2.24
- evolution-data-server >= 2.24.5

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in base64 encoding and decoding functions.
- The issue is due to the order of operations in calculating memory allocation sizes, where multiplication by 3 occurs before division by 4, which results in a potential integer overflow.
- Patches have been released to address this vulnerability by correcting the memory allocation calculation and adding checks for input sizes that could cause an overflow.
- Several related CVEs were assigned for other applications vulnerable to the same issue due to code duplication, including libsoup (CVE-2009-0585), gst-plugins-base (CVE-2009-0586), and evolution-data-server (CVE-2009-0587).
- The vulnerability is also reported to affect openSUSE, SLE, Debian, and Ubuntu, with specific versions of glib2, and corresponding fixes.
- The patches modify the code to correctly allocate memory based on the input size and incorporate overflow checks, ensuring sufficient buffer space and preventing buffer overflows.
- The flaw was initially discovered in glib2 but also found in other libraries using similar base64 encoding logic.

**Timeline**
- The vulnerability was reported on 2008-10-22.
- A patch for glib was supplied on 2008-12-05, with extended scope to include eds and gst.
- Vendor contact for gnome-upstream, gstreamer, and evolution data server lead began from 2008-11-27 through 2009-03-04.
