  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"

  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass the admin login and gain access to the admin panel by using SQL injection. They can also disclose files from the server by using another SQL injection vulnerability in the downloadmp3.php file.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP requests to the login page and the downloadmp3.php script with specially crafted SQL payloads"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is needed to exploit the RFI."
