**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `download.php` script of WebPortal CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `download.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (`aid` parameter) before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a web request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server running WebPortal CMS.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable `aid` parameter in `download.php`.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses a crafted URL: `/download.php?aid=1'+union+select+pass,0,0,0,0+from+portal_users+where+id='1` to inject SQL code.
- This injected code retrieves the password hashes from the `portal_users` table.
- The provided exploit script uses LWP::Simple to send the malicious request to the server and extract the MD5 password hash from the response.

**Additional Information**

- The exploit was discovered by StAkeR and published on exploit-db.com.
