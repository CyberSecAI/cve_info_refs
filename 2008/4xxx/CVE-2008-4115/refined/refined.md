Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4115:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Talkback 2.3.6 application is vulnerable to local file inclusion due to improper input validation in the `comments.php` and `install/help.php` files. Additionally, the application reveals PHP configuration information through `install/info.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `language` parameter in `comments.php` and `install/help.php` is vulnerable to LFI. By manipulating this parameter with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../..`) and a null byte, an attacker can include arbitrary local files on the server.
- **PHPInfo Disclosure:** The `install/info.php` page provides detailed PHP configuration information, which can be used by attackers to identify potential attack vectors.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **LFI:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the server's filesystem, including configuration files, source code, and potentially user data. This could lead to information disclosure and further compromise of the system.
- **PHPInfo Disclosure:** The exposed PHP configuration could reveal sensitive information about the server environment, which could be leveraged to plan more targeted attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET requests:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable files, modifying the `language` parameter to include the path of local files.
    - `comments.php?language=[Local File]%00`
    - `install/help.php?language=[Local File]%00`
    - `install/info.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server, meaning that the attacker can be located anywhere with network access to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by SirGod and is associated with the MorTal TeaM.
