Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-4757, as well as two other related CVEs:

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple parameters ("id", "prev") in `add_postit.php`, `delete.php`, `prest_detail.php`, and `mod_prest_date.php` are not properly validated, allowing for SQL injection.
*   **Local File Download:** The `download_file.php` script allows downloading of arbitrary local files via the `fichierwe` parameter.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `add_prest_date.php` script is vulnerable to XSS via the `date` parameter.

**Root Cause:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Lack of proper input validation and sanitization in PHP scripts when handling user-supplied parameters intended for database queries.
*   **Local File Download:** Insufficient path validation in the `download_file.php` script, allowing access to the file system beyond the intended directory.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of proper input sanitization when handling the `date` parameter in the `add_prest_date.php` script before displaying it on the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive database information.
    *   Potential for database manipulation (data modification/deletion).
*   **Local File Download:**
    *   Reading of arbitrary local files from the server (e.g., configuration files containing database credentials).
    *   Exfiltration of sensitive information.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Execution of unauthorized JavaScript within the victim's browser.
    *   Session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** By injecting malicious SQL code via vulnerable parameters in the URL.
*   **Local File Download:** By manipulating the `fichierwe` parameter in the URL to point to arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious JavaScript via the `date` parameter in the URL

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*  For SQL Injection and Local File Download, no authentication is required, so even a simple user can perform those attacks.
*  For the XSS attack, the attacker must be able to interact with the `add_prest_date.php` page.

**Additional Information**

* The affected application is "PHPdaily".
* The identified vulnerabilities are SQL Injection, Local File Download, and Cross-Site Scripting.
* The risk is considered high.
* The exploits were published on 2008-10-23 and the content was published by "0xFFFFFF".

It's important to note that while the provided text mentions three CVEs (2008-4756, 2008-4757, and 2008-4758), the content focuses on vulnerabilities within PHPdaily, which are related to all three CVEs. The content provides more detailed information about how to exploit those vulnerabilities.
