Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4624:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** in the `init.php` file of Fast Click SQL 1.1.7 Lite.
*   The `init.php` file uses a variable `$CFG['CDIR']` to include other PHP files, specifically `global.php` and `sql.php`.
*   The value of `$CFG['CDIR']` is derived from user input through the HTTP GET parameter `CFG[CDIR]`. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path or URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unvalidated Input:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied input (`CFG[CDIR]`) before using it in a file inclusion statement.
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The ability to include a remote file via a URL is a classic RFI vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP file from a remote location. This could lead to:
    *   **Complete compromise of the server:** Full control of the server including data access, modification and service disruption.
    *   **Data theft:** Access to sensitive information stored on the server.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Using the compromised server to distribute malware.
    *   **Website defacement:** Modification of website content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request to `common/init.php`.
*   The attacker injects the URL of a malicious PHP file by using the `CFG[CDIR]` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker needs to host or have access to a malicious PHP file to include.
*   No authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `common/init.php`
*   **Vulnerable Code:**
    ```php
    require($CFG['CDIR'].'/global.php');
    require($CFG['CDIR'].'/sql.php');
    ```
*   **Exploit:**
    `http://localhost/[path]/common/init.php?CFG[CDIR]=[evilcode]`

The Exploit-DB entry provides a clear and concise summary of the vulnerability and how to exploit it.

**Summary**

The vulnerability is a classic RFI due to lack of input validation, and allows remote code execution by including an attacker controlled file by specifying the full path as part of the CFG[CDIR] parameter.
