    "CVE-2008-4844": {
        "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists as an invalid pointer reference in the data binding function of Internet Explorer. When data binding is enabled (which is the default state), it is possible under certain conditions for an object to be released without updating the array length, leaving the potential to access the deleted object's memory space. This can cause Internet Explorer to exit unexpectedly, in a state that is exploitable.",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists as an invalid pointer reference in the data binding function of Internet Explorer.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Invalid pointer reference",
            "Memory corruption vulnerability"
        ],
        "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker could gain elevated privileges, execute arbitrary code or cause a vulnerable application to crash.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "Specially crafted Web page",
             "Email message or attachment"
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to convince a user to view a specially crafted web page or email.",
           "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when data binding is used, and an object is released without updating the array length. This leads to a use-after-free condition and allows access to the deleted object's memory space."
