##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Microsoft Updates for Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedOctober 19, 2016
Alert CodeTA08-344A

### Systems Affected

Microsoft Windows and related software

### Overview

Sun has released alerts to address multiple vulnerabilities affecting the Sun Java Runtime Environment. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

As part of the Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for December 2008, Microsoft released updates to address vulnerabilities that affect Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer, Word, Excel, SharePoint Server, Visual Basic 6 and other related components.

### Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could gain elevated privileges, execute arbitrary code or cause a vulnerable application to crash.

### Solution

Microsoft has provided updates for these vulnerabilities in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for December 2008](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-dec.mspx). The security bulletin describes any known issues related to the updates. Administrators are encouraged to note these issues and test for any potentially adverse effects. Administrators should consider using an automated update distribution system such as Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).

## Digital Transformation is Driving Big Changes in Your Network

With many of today’s applications moving to virtualization, it's never been more challenging to build, secure, and manage hybrid networks. Cloud, edge, and SD-WAN are transforming your network, but making it harder to ensure security compliance and a consistent user experience. Between evolving applications, increased security threats, and changing service models, it’s tough to keep up.

Your network needs a source of truth — before, during, and after deployment. With a complete portfolio of test, visibility, and security solutions, companies trust us to future-proof their networks throughout their entire lifecycle.

Enterprises, service providers, government agencies, financial institutions, and networking vendors worldwide trust us to help build and manage their networks, including:

## Discover Keysight's Network Solutions

## Ensure High-Performing Networks and Applications

Whether you're manufacturing network equipment or designing your own network, you need to build for optimal performance and compliance. That means testing your network in hybrid environments against a range of protocols, traffic patterns, and application workloads. It’s not easy, but the up-front work won't just pay dividends in satisfied users and proven performance; it's more cost effective as well. After all, bugs found before deployment are 90–100 times cheaper to fix than those in production.

**Keysight can help.** We offer a wide range of network test solutions for today’s most demanding network architectures.

[Network Test Solutions](/us/en/solutions/network-test.html)

## Understand What's Happening on Your Live Network

Your production network is one of your most valuable strategic assets. You need to innovate continuously, meet aggressive service level agreements, and keep everything running smoothly and securely. That means capturing deep insights into network traffic, applications, and user experience across your entire network environment — enabling you to eliminate blind spots, increase efficiency, and get the right data to the right tools at the right time.

**Keysight can help.** We offer a wide range of network visibility solutions to help you better connect and secure your network by monitoring and responding to network and security issues on your network.

## Test Your Network Security by Hacking Yourself

Security is never static. New threats are ever-present, and misconfigurations can compromise your network in an instant. While it may sound counterintuitive, you need to hack yourself — before someone else does. By safely simulating the latest attacks on your production network, you can definitively measure risk, expose gaps, and course-correct with step-by-step remediations.

**Keysight can help.** With our network security solutions, you can continuously validate your defenses, reduce your attack surface, and prove you’re safer than you were yesterday.

## Deliver the Best Possible User Experience

Your network team supports a broad range of applications (including unified communications, VoIP, and video) — all with varying degrees of sensitivity to latency and loss. But when it comes to monitoring performance, passively waiting for live network data is not enough. If you want to find connectivity issues or performance problems before your subscribers do, you need to be proactive.

**Keysight can help.** With our performance monitoring solutions, you can minimize downtime by continuously testing, validating, and monitoring quality of service — from your centralized applications to your users on the network’s edge.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Pointer Reference Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4844

A remote code execution vulnerability exists as an invalid pointer reference in the data binding function of Internet Explorer. When data binding is enabled (which is the default state), it is possible under certain conditions for an object to be released without updating the array length, leaving the potential to access the deleted object's memory space. This can cause Internet Explorer to exit unexpectedly, in a state that is exploitable.

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-4844](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4844).

#### Mitigating Factors for Pointer Reference Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4844

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, [Protected Mode](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/ie7-protected-mode.aspx) in Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 Beta 2 in Windows Vista and later helps protect users and their systems from malicious downloads by restricting requests to start another program or requests to save files without the user's consent. This includes user or system files and settings.

#### Workarounds for Pointer Reference Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4844

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  \*\*Impact of workaround.\*\*There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting.

If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Disable XML Island** **functionality**

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  Create a backup copy of the registry keys by using the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  `Regedit.exe /e Disable_XML_Island_backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{379E501F-B231-11D1-ADC1-00805FC752D8}`

  For Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 only, take ownership of [HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\CLSID\{379E501F-B231-11D1-ADC1-00805FC752D8}], as follows:

  1. As an administrator, click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**
  2. Go to [HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\CLSID\{379E501F-B231-11D1-ADC1-00805FC752D8}]
  3. Click **Permission**, then **Advanced**, then **Owner**
  4. Change **Owner** to **Administrator**
  5. Click **Grant Full Control to Administrator**
  6. Then iterate for all subkeys

  Next, save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Disable\_XML\_Island.reg:

  `Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{379E501F-B231-11D1-ADC1-00805FC752D8}]`

  Run Disable\_XML\_Island.reg with the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  `Regedit.exe /s Disable_XML_Island.reg`

  **Impact of workaround:** Embedded XML in HTML may not render correctly.

  **How to undo the workaround**

  Restore the original state by running the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  `Regedit.exe /s Disable_XML_Island_backup.reg`

  **How to undo the workaround introduced in Security Advisory 961051**

  [Microsoft Security Advisory 961051](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/961051) introduced a manual registry change method for this same workaround. If you had used this method and now desire to undo this workaround, use the following registry file:

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{379E501F-B231-11D1-ADC1-00805FC752D8}]
  @="MsxmlIsland"
  [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{379E501F-B231-11D1-ADC1-00805FC752D8}\InProcServer32]
  @=hex(2):25,00,53,00,79,00,73,00,74,00,65,00,6d,00,52,00,6f,00,6f,00,74,00,25,\

  @="{D63E0CE2-A0A2-11D0-9C02-00C04FC99C8E}"

  ```
* **Restrict Internet Explorer from using OLEDB32.dll with an Integrity Level ACL**

  This workaround applies only to Windows Vista and newer operating systems and requires that UAC prompting and Protected Mode be enabled, which are the default settings.

  Save the following text to a temporary directory:

  **For 32-bit systems**

  Save to a text file called: "BlockAccess\_x86.inf"

  ```
  [Unicode]
  Unicode=yes
  [Version]
  signature="$CHICAGO$"
  Revision=1
  [File Security]
  "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\System\Ole DB\oledb32.dll",2,"S:(ML;;NWNRNX;;;ME)"

  ```

  **For 64-bit systems**

  Save to a text file called: "BlockAccess\_x64.inf"

  ```
  [Unicode]
  Unicode=yes
  [Version]
  signature="$CHICAGO$"
  Revision=1
  [File Security]
  "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\System\Ole DB\oledb32.dll",2,"S:(ML;;NWNRNX;;;ME)"
  "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\System\Ole DB\oledb32.dll",2,"S:(ML;;NWNRNX;;;ME)"

  ```

  Run the following command from the temporary directory as an Administrator:

  `SecEdit /configure /db BlockAccess.sdb /cfg <inf file="file">`

  After the command completes, you should see the following messages:

  `The task has completed successfully.See log %windir%\security\logs\scesrv.log for detail info.`

  **Validating the workaround**

  To validate that the workaround was successfully applied, run the following commands at a command prompt:

  **For 32-bit systems**

  `icacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\System\Ole DB\oledb32.dll"`

  **For 64-bit systems**

  ```
  icacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\System\Ole DB\oledb32.dll"
  icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\System\Ole DB\oledb32.dll"

  ```

  Each time you run icacls, search through the output for the following line.

  `Mandatory Label\Medium Mandatory Level:(NW,NR,NX)`

  **Impact of workaround:** Any ADO/OLE DB applications running in Internet Explorer, which is not common, will stop functioning. The impact is minimal since all other processes running in **Medium** or higher integrity level would still be able to load the dll and use it.

  **How to undo the workaround**

  Save the following text to a temporary directory:

  **For 32-bit systems**

  Save to a text file called: "unBlockAccess\_x86.inf"

#### FAQ for Pointer Reference Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4844

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists as an invalid pointer reference in the data binding function of Internet Explorer. When data binding is enabled (which is the default state), it is possible under certain conditions for an object to be released without updating the array length, leaving the potential to access the deleted object's memory space. This can cause Internet Explorer to exit unexpectedly, in a state that is exploitable. As a result, memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited the remote code execution vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail messages or is visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail messages are read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read e-mail on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Which of the workarounds should I apply to my system in order to be protected?**

Based on our investigation, setting the Internet zone security setting to **High** will protect users from known attacks. However, for the most effective protection, customers should evaluate a combination of using the **High** security setting in conjunction with one of the following workarounds.

* Disable XML Island functionality
* Restrict Internet Explorer from using OLEDB32.dll with an Integrity Level ACL
* Disable Row Position functionality of OLEDB32.dll
* Unregister OLEDB32.dll
* Use ACL to disable OLEDB32.dll

For additional workaround details, please see the following post: .

Each of these workarounds is equally effective in protecting customers; however, each workaround has different impacts based on the environment in which they are applied. We encourage customers to evaluate which of the workarounds would be least impactful to their environment, based on the impact statements included with each workaround.

**How does configuring the Internet zone security setting to High protect me from this vulnerability?**

Setting the Internet zone security setting to **High** protects against all currently known exploits of this vulnerability by disabling scripting, disabling less secure features in Internet Explorer, and blocks known techniques used to bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP). It is important to note that the vulnerable code may be reached even with these protections in place, however current attacks would not be successful with these workarounds in place.

**How does Protected Mode in Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 Beta 2 on Windows** **Vista** **and later protect me from this vulnerability?**

Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 Beta 2 in Windows Vista run in [Protected Mode](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/ie7-protected-mode.aspx) by default in the Internet security zone. (Protected Mode is off by default in the Intranet zone.) Protected Mode significantly reduces the ability of an attacker to write, alter, or destroy data on the userâs machine or to install malicious code. This is accomplished by using the integrity mechanisms of Windows Vista which restrict access to processes, files, and registry keys with higher integrity levels.

**What is Data Execution Prevention (DEP)?**

Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is included in Internet Explorer; disabled by default in Internet Explorer 7, and enabled by default in Internet Explorer 8 Beta 2. DEP is designed to help foil attacks by preventing code from running in memory that is marked non-executable. For more information about DEP in Internet Explorer, please see the following post: [https://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/04/08/ie8-security-part-I\_3A00\_-dep-nx-memory-protection.aspx](https://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/04/08/ie8-security-part-i_3a00_-dep-nx-memory-protection.aspx). Recently, proof of concept code was published that demonstrates methods to bypass DEP. However, the workarounds included in this bulletin, of setting the security slider to **High** as well as applying one of the OLEDB32.dll workarounds, are still effective in blocking current attacks.

**What does the update do?**

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way Internet Explorer validates data binding parameters and handles the error resulting in the exploitable condition.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2008-4844](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4844).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. When the security bulletin was released, Microsoft had received information that this vulnerability was being exploited.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Microsoft Internet Explorer data binding memory corruption vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#493881

Original Release Date: 2008-12-11 | Last Revised: 2008-12-18

---

### Overview

Microsoft Internet Explorer contains an invalid pointer vulnerability in its data binding code, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Internet Explorer contains an invalid pointer vulnerability in its [data binding](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531388%28vs.85%29.aspx) code. The vulnerability can be triggered when Internet Explorer or a program that uses Internet Explorer's components renders a document that contains more than one reference to the same data source. This flaw can cause an invalid array size and result in the accessing of memory space of a deleted object. Specially crafted content that performs data binding, such as an XML or HTML document, can cause IE to crash in a way that is exploitable. Limited testing has shown this vulnerability to affect Internet Explorer 6 and later, up to and including Internet Explorer 8 Beta 2. However, all versions of Internet Explorer from 4.0 and on may be at risk. We have confirmed that Outlook Express is also at risk. Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted document that performs data binding (e.g., a web page or email message or attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS08-078](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-078.mspx). This update provides new versions of mshtml.dll and wmshtml.dll, depending on the target operating system. More details are available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [960714](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/960714). Consider the following workarounds if you are unable to apply the update: |
| --- |

| **Disable the Microsoft OLE DB Row Position Library COM object**The most effective way of mitigating this vulnerability appears to be to disable the Microsoft OLE DB Row Position Library COM object. As outlined in the Microsoft Security Advisory, delete the following registry key:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\CLSID\{2048EEE6-7FA2-11D0-9E6A-00A0C9138C29}]Note that once this change is made, all ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) applications that use the RowPosition property and related information and all OLE DB applications that use the OLE DB Row Position Library will not function properly.**Disable Active Scripting**This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling Active Scripting in the Internet Zone, as specified in the "[Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer)" document. Note that this will not block the vulnerability. IE still may crash when parsing specially crafted XML content. Disabling Active Scripting will mitigate a common method used to achieve code execution with this vulnerability.**Enable DEP in Internet Explorer 7**[Enabling DEP in Internet Explorer 7](http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2006/12/12/update-on-internet-explorer-7-dep-and-adobe-software.aspx) on Windows Vista can help mitigate this vulnerability by making it more difficult to achieve code execution using this vulnerability. |

Any program that uses Internet Explorer's MSHTML layout engine, such as Outlook Express, may be at risk. Further details are available in US-CERT Vulnerability Note [VU#493881](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/493881).

### Impact

By convincing a user to view a specially crafted document that performs data binding (e.g., a web page or email message or attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user.

### Solution

**Apply an update**

This issue is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS08-078](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-078.mspx). This update provides new versions of mshtml.dll and wmshtml.dll, depending on the target operating system. More details are available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [960714](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/960714).

**Disable Active Scripting**

 This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling Active Scripting in the Internet Zone, as specified in the [Securing Your Web Browser](/reading_room/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer) document. Note that this will not block the vulnerability. IE still may crash when parsing specially crafted content.
