  "CVE-2008-4199": {
    "description": "Opera before 9.52 does not prevent use of links from web pages to feed source files on the local disk, which might allow remote attackers to determine the validity of local filenames via vectors involving \"detection of JavaScript events and appropriate manipulation.\"",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of links to local files from web pages, specifically within the context of feed source files.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Inadequate restriction of links to local files.",
      "Information disclosure vulnerability"
