| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:18:26 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached tcl-8.3.3.ebuild and tk-8.3.3.ebuild.  These ebuilds accomplish the following:  1. split the tcl and tk packages into separate ebuilds. This makes writing ebuilds for packages that depend on tcl and/or tk much easier to handle (see expect-5.33.0.ebuild post and the vim-6.0-r2.ebuild patch attached).  I recommend putting the tcl ebuild under dev-lang/tcl and the tk ebuild under dev-tcltk/tk.   2. ebuilds are now version independent.   Renaming ebuilds to *-8.4.2.ebuild should work.  I have not tested this, but these ebuilds were based on the tcl-tk-8.4.2.ebuild.  3. The original tcl-tk-8.3.3.ebuild did not install the private headers and config.sh's for tcl and tk.  This is why vim-6.0-r2.ebuild did not work with 'use tcltk'  4. Promotes world peace and smells minty fresh.  Splitting up tcl and tk into separate ebuilds may cause some minor pain updating the dependencies of ebuilds that depend on them, but I think it is worth it in the long run.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:19:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 13](attachment.cgi?id=13 "tk-8.3.3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=13&action=edit "tk-8.3.3.ebuild")] tk-8.3.3.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Damon Conway (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-09 14:18:30 UTC  ``` Accepting as a real bug.  I'm testing the ebuilds out on my system. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Damon Conway (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-09 14:37:14 UTC  ``` It works for me, so I'm committing the ebuild. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-09 14:44:14 UTC  ``` Hi!  Some additional info that might be of use.  1. The expect ebuild ([bug 28](show_bug.cgi?id=28 "RESOLVED FIXED - expect-5.33.0.ebuild")) is a good test of a working tcl and tk installation. It depends on tcl-8.3* and tk-8.3*, but won't compile because the private headers are not installed by the current tcl-tk ebuild.  2. Contrary to my original comments, the submitted tcl-8.3.3 ebuild does not fix the vim --with-tcl problem.  It does allow vim to be compiled successfully using the --with-tcl configure flag and the resulting vim appears to run fine, however it doesn't pass the  VIMINIT='let OS = system("uname -s")' vim test that agriffis pointed out to me (see vim-6.0-r3.ebuild)  This appears to be an upstream vim issue.  tod ``` |  |

# Why VNC® Connect

### Our flagship product, VNC Connect, is the remote access solution for organizations that demand strong security, resilience, and peace of mind.

[Start your 14-day free trial](https://manage.realvnc.com/trial)

![why-vcn-connect](data:image/svg+xml...)

## **Prioritizing security to keep your systems safe and your users protected**

Today’s teams have more freedom in where they can work, meaning IT support needs to be flexible in how they adapt to resolving challenges. On-premise support isn’t always feasible and costs time and money, while VPNs can feel cumbersome and clunky for users.

VNC Connect gives modern organizations of all sizes the remote access and support solution they need. Secure, reliable, and easy-to-use, you can deliver fast, effective IT support and servicing at scale.

![Security](data:image/svg+xml...)

Security

## Offer remote access at scale with confidence

Enterprise-grade security protects your systems from external threats, while a suite of admin tools gives you complete control of access across the organization.

###### End-to-end encryption

Every session is fully encrypted at
up to 256-bit AES.

###### Advanced authentication

Set up multi-factor authentication options to defend against unauthorized access.

###### Granular access control

Highly configurable options let you finetune access and permissions at individual, role or group level.

Collaboration

## Help teams connect the dots, here, there… wherever

Bring cross-functional teams together, no matter where they are, to connect, collaborate and achieve their shared goals. Get everyone around the screen to discuss ideas and solutions or handover control and let a teammate take over.

###### Session recording

Capture sessions on video to support training materials or track compliance.

###### Easily share files

With file sharing you can easily send or retrieve files over sessions.

###### Real-time chat

Better assist users with the ability for technicians to message end-users in real-time whilst in a session.

Productivity

## Set your team free by streamlining processes

Make light work of time-consuming admin with tools that make managing user access, permissions, and devices easy and efficient, and all at scale.

###### Mass deployment

Roll out remote access to devices at scale with ease using group policy.

###### Unlimited concurrent sessions

Run multiple Device Access sessions at once giving your team more freedom to work efficiently.

###### Access management

Easily assign and manage users, as well as their levels of access, across the organization.

Reliability & Performance

## Exceed everyone’s expectations with a trusted solution

## **Prioritizing security to keep your systems safe and your users protected**

Today’s teams have more freedom in where they can work, meaning IT support needs to be flexible in how they adapt to resolving challenges. On-premise support isn’t always feasible and costs time and money, while VPNs can feel cumbersome and clunky for users.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Real VNC: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200903-17**

The Real VNC client is vulnerable to execution of arbitrary code when
connecting to a malicious server.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/vnc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.1.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.1.3** |

### Background

Real VNC is a remote desktop viewer display system.

### Description

An unspecified vulnerability has been discovered int the
CMsgReader::readRect() function in the VNC Viewer component, related to
the encoding type of RFB protocol data.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to connect to a malicious VNC
server, or leverage Man-in-the-Middle attacks, to cause the execution
of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the VNC
viewer.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Real VNC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/vnc-4.1.3"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
