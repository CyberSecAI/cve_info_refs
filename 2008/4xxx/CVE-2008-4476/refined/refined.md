Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Summary:**

The core issue revolves around the insecure use of temporary files, specifically within the `/tmp` directory, by various applications and scripts. This can lead to symlink attacks where a malicious user can create a symlink in `/tmp` with the same name as the temporary file, causing the vulnerable program to overwrite or manipulate arbitrary files.

**Root Cause:**

- Programs create temporary files in `/tmp` using predictable names (often based on PID, or just a fixed name)
- Programs do not use secure methods to create temporary files, such as using `mkstemp` with `O_EXCL`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** Scripts use insecure methods to create temporary files in `/tmp`, making them susceptible to symlink attacks. They use `open TMP, ">/tmp/filename"` which will create or overwrite a file.
- **Predictable Filenames:** Some of the filenames used for temporary files are either fixed or easily predictable, making it easier for an attacker to target a specific file.
- **Lack of Proper File Handling:** The programs do not properly check for or prevent symlink attacks during temporary file creation.
- **Leftover Debug Code:** Some instances include leftover debug code that writes to fixed files in `/tmp` without checking for symlinks.
- **Use of non-private temporary directory:** Some applications use /tmp instead of their own private temporary directory, creating the possibility for symlink attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system, including system configuration files, user data, and other sensitive files.
- **Data Loss:** This could lead to data loss or corruption.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker might overwrite critical files causing denial of service for applications or the system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, overwriting specific files could potentially lead to privilege escalation.
- **Information Disclosure:**  Although not explicitly mentioned, if a program writes sensitive information into a predictable temporary file in `/tmp`, another user could potentially read that information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system with the ability to create symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.
- **Symlink Creation:** The attacker creates a symlink in `/tmp` pointing to a target file or directory.
- **Program Execution:** When the vulnerable program executes, it opens and writes to the symlink, which redirects the write operation to the attacker's target.
- **Triggering Vulnerable Code:** In some cases, it may require specific user actions or administrator actions for the vulnerable code paths to be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local System Access:** The attacker needs to have a user account on the target system with the ability to write to `/tmp` which generally all local users can do.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of file systems, symlinks, and how to exploit the temporary file creation process.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided Gentoo bug tracker entry (235770) acts as a tracker for multiple issues related to insecure temporary files.
- The Debian bug reports and the oss-security mailing list thread highlight a broader effort to audit and fix these kinds of vulnerabilities across multiple packages.
- Some of the included patches and fixes involve removing the debug code, and ensuring that temporary files are created with proper security in mind by using `mkstemp` or writing to a private temporary directory instead of `/tmp`.
