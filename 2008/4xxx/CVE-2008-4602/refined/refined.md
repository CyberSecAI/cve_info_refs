Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability:** Local File Inclusion (LFI)

**Root Cause:** The `index.php` script in Post Affiliate Pro v2.0 does not properly sanitize user input provided through the `md` parameter. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server by manipulating the `md` parameter with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application lacks proper checks on the `md` parameter, allowing directory traversal sequences and null byte injection.
*   **Direct File Inclusion:** The application directly includes files based on user-provided input, without proper sanitization or restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, and application source code.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Reading configuration files could reveal database credentials or other sensitive information that could be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to `index.php` with the malicious payload in the `md` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged into the Post Affiliate Pro system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server where Post Affiliate Pro is installed.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in `index.php` file.
*   The `md` parameter is vulnerable to local file inclusion.
*   The exploit uses directory traversal sequences (`../`) and null byte injection (`%00`) to bypass restrictions.
*   The provided exploit URL is: `http://site.com/affiliates/index.php?md=../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`

**CVSS Metrics:**
*   Base Score: 6.5/10
*   Impact Subscore: 6.4/10
*   Exploitability Subscore: 8/10
*   Attack complexity: Low
*   Authentication: Single time
*   Confidentiality impact: Partial
*   Integrity impact: Partial
*   Availability impact: Partial

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Post Affiliate Pro v2.0.
*   The vulnerability was reported by ZeN.
*   Exploit-DB ID: 6772
