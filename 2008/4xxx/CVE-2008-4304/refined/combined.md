| [Description](#c0)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-17 23:18:53 UTC  ``` CVE-2006-1495 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2006-1495>):   SQL injection vulnerability in general/sendpassword.php in (1) PHPCollab 2.4   and 2.5.rc3, and (2) NetOffice 2.5.3-pl1 and 2.6.0b2 allows remote attackers   to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the loginForm parameter in the   "forgotten password" option. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-18 00:24:30 UTC  ``` Re-reating as B1 as it indirectly allows for remote code execution. I initially intended to hack up a quick patch, but well, after having a quick look at the code.... This thing should really be removed from the tree, because:   * The SQL injection issue is not just present in general/sendpassword.php     but almost *EVERYWHERE*   * The admin panel allows for PHP code injection as demonstrated in $URL     (requires admin privs which you can obtain by exploiting the SQL     injection issue)   * With register_globals=on it looks like it is possible to inject arbitrary     shell code (general/login.php:28 using SSL_CLIENT_CERT)  Most of this also assumes magic_quotes_gpc=off. I only had a quick look at the code, so someone should maybe verify this...   I'm referring to the 2.4 (even stable on Gentoo/ppc) code base, but 2.5 has the same code and is vulnerable as well. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-18 00:46:28 UTC  ``` I just verified that the mentioned issues are really exploitable... they are. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-18 01:04:21 UTC  ``` Found yet another issue which allows for remote code execution. It doesn't depend on register_globals/magic_quotes_gpc either, so the default config should be considered vulnerable (forwarding exact exploit in private).  Time for p.mask + removal? :) ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-18 10:55:27 UTC  ``` I'd mask because of the state the code is in. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-18 11:05:34 UTC  ``` Upstream replied to my mail from tonight and said they'll look into it, but I doubt this can be fixed in a few days... ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-18 16:30:01 UTC  ``` I privately mailed coley to get CVEs and asked upstream about the plans for a fixed version. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-08-25 23:13:36 UTC  ``` +# Christian Hoffmann <hoffie@gentoo.org> (26 Aug 2008) +# Masked for security, [bug 235052](show_bug.cgi?id=235052 "RESOLVED FIXED - www-apps/phpcollab: SQL / shell command / PHP code injection (CVE-2006-1495, CVE-2008-{4303,4304,4305})"); codebase seems to have lots of problems, +# needs time to fix or final removing, see the referenced bug for progress +www-apps/phpcollab  Let's see if upstream is able to provide a fix in the near future, haven't got any new responses (neither from upstream nor from coley). ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-09-06 20:11:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=235052#c7)) > Let's see if upstream is able to provide a fix in the near future, haven't got > any new responses (neither from upstream nor from coley). I'm usually not impatient with regards to email response times, but as we are talking about a security issue here and I have neither received a reply from upstream nor from coley, I've resent both mails with a short ping.  ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-10-13 16:28:37 UTC  ``` Yet another months gone (or even more) and still no reply, I wonder what makes our mails (Robert's and mine) not reach Coley... Should we go without CVEs? Or maybe try vendor-sec? ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-10-19 16:50:58 UTC  ``` bressers gave us CVEs, mail to vendor-sec sent as well. Still no further upstream reaction. Are we going to send a maskglsa soon? I think we should really give out some kind of advisory. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-10-19 20:05:18 UTC  ``` request filed, let's add 2008-10-31 to the bug as removal date and get this here over with. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Gunnar Wrobel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-10-30 15:00:17 UTC  ``` Issued last rites. Package will be removed in 30 days. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-11-06 14:00:43 UTC  ``` Security, we should really send a GLSA here, shouldn't we? And we are way overdue our timeline... ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Gunnar Wrobel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-12-03 10:46:56 UTC  ``` Ebuild removed. webapps done. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-12-21 19:27:33 UTC  ``` GLSA 200812-20, sorry for the delay. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# phpCollab: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200812-20**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpCollab allowing for
remote injection of shell commands, PHP code and SQL statements.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/phpcollab** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.5\_rc3** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

phpCollab is a web-enabled groupware and project management software
written in PHP. It uses SQL-based database backends.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in phpCollab:

* rgod reported that data sent to general/sendpassword.php via the
  loginForm parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an
  SQL statement (CVE-2006-1495).
* Christian Hoffmann of Gentoo
  Security discovered multiple vulnerabilities where input is
  insufficiently sanitized before being used in an SQL statement, for
  instance in general/login.php via the loginForm parameter.
  (CVE-2008-4303).
* Christian Hoffmann also found out that the
  variable $SSL\_CLIENT\_CERT in general/login.php is not properly
  sanitized before being used in a shell command. (CVE-2008-4304).
* User-supplied data to installation/setup.php is not checked before
  being written to include/settings.php which is executed later. This
  issue was reported by Christian Hoffmann as well (CVE-2008-4305).

### Impact

These vulnerabilities enable remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL
statements and PHP code. NOTE: Some of the SQL injection
vulnerabilities require the php.ini option "magic\_quotes\_gpc" to be
disabled. Furthermore, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary
shell commands if "register\_globals" is enabled, "magic\_quotes\_gpc" is
disabled, the PHP OpenSSL extension is not installed or loaded and the
file "installation/setup.php" has not been deleted after installation.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

phpCollab has been removed from the Portage tree. We recommend that
users unmerge phpCollab:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "www-apps/phpcollab"
```
