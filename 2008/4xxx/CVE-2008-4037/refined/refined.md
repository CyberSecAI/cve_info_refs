An attacker could gain the rights of the logged-on user, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights. Systems where users have administrative privileges are at greater risk.\n\n- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would have to host a specially crafted server share or website. The attacker would have to convince users to visit the malicious server or website (e.g., via a link in an email or instant message).\n\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must host a malicious SMB server. The user must connect to the attacker's server."

  "summary": "CVE-2008-4037 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol. It occurs because the protocol does not correctly opt-in to NTLM credential reflection protections, allowing an attacker to replay the user's credentials back to them. An attacker hosting a malicious SMB server and convincing a user to connect to it can gain the user's privileges, potentially taking complete control of the system. This vulnerability was addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-068. The tool 'SmbRelay3' can be used to exploit this vulnerability."
