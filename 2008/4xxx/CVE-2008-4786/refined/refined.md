{
  "CVE-2008-4786": {
    "Description": "SQL injection vulnerability in easyshop.php in the EasyShop plugin for e107 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the category_id parameter.",
    "Root cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query. Specifically, the `category_id` parameter in `easyshop.php` is vulnerable.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to:\n  - Data breaches (confidentiality impact)\n  - Data modification (integrity impact)\n  - Denial of service (availability impact) by manipulating or deleting data.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the `category_id` parameter in the `easyshop.php` script of the EasyShop plugin for e107.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
    ,
    "Additional details": "The exploit code provided demonstrates how to extract the MD5 hash of the administrator's password by using a blind SQL injection technique. The attacker sends multiple requests with crafted `category_id` values and analyzes the server response to deduce the password."
