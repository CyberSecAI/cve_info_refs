Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-4027:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft Office parses malformed Rich Text Format (RTF) documents, specifically when processing consecutive "\do" Drawing Object tags.
*   The `mso.dll` library does not properly verify the integrity of the drawing object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Double Free:** The core issue is that the vulnerable code frees a memory buffer twice, leading to heap corruption. This double-free vulnerability allows for further exploitation due to the corrupted heap.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The software does not properly validate the structure and integrity of the drawing object data within the RTF file. This lack of validation allows the attacker to trigger the double-free condition.
*   **Heap Corruption:** The double free corrupts the heap memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **System Compromise:** An attacker can gain complete control of the affected system under the credentials of the currently logged-in user. This can lead to:
    *   Installation of programs
    *   Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    *   Creation of new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious RTF Document:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted RTF document. The user must open this document using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office Word or Outlook.
*   **Email:** A malicious RTF document can be delivered via email. In the case of Outlook 2007 (which uses Word as the default email editor), simply previewing or opening a specially crafted email can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Web:**  A website can host the malicious RTF file. An attacker could convince a user to visit this page, and open or download the malformed RTF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be located remotely from the victim.
*   **Malicious RTF Creation:** The attacker needs the capability to craft a malicious RTF document containing the specific sequence of "\do" drawing object tags that trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the user to open the malicious RTF document or preview an email with a malicious RTF attachment.

**Additional Details:**

*   Microsoft has released a security update to correct this vulnerability (MS08-072).
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers were protected by Digital Vaccine filter ID '6607'.
*   This vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2008-05-19 and publicly disclosed on 2008-12-09
