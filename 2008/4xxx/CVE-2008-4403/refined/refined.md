  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-4403",
      "root_cause": "The Trend Micro OfficeScan server CGI modules have a buffer overflow vulnerability and a null pointer dereference issue. Additionally, the OfficeScan Update Agent client has a directory traversal vulnerability.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer overflow in CGI modules",
        "Null pointer dereference in CGI modules",
        "Directory traversal vulnerability in OfficeScan Update Agent"
      ],
      "impact": "The buffer overflow may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with Web user privileges. The null pointer dereference can cause a target child process to close, potentially leading to denial of service. The directory traversal vulnerability can allow attackers to traverse directories and disclose file contents.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Exploiting the buffer overflow via crafted requests to CGI modules.",
        "Sending crafted HTTP headers to trigger the null pointer dereference.",
        "Manipulating update file paths to perform directory traversal through the OfficeScan Update Agent."
       ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send crafted HTTP requests, headers or file paths to exploit the respective vulnerabilities. Web user privileges are required to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability."
