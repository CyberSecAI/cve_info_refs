### Python VM breakout bugs

---

Programs affected: Python prior to v2.5.2.

Severity: Break out of Python VM if you can execute arbitrary Python
code. Possible attacks against trusted applications using affected APIs.Various bugs I reported were fixed in the v2.5.2 Python release. There were
a lot of Python vendor security updates recently; these fixes were fed into
that process. Specific bugs include:

* Integer overflow in audioop module (corruption not really controllable by
  attacker):
  ```

  import audioop
  s = ''
  audioop.ratecv(s, 1, 1073741824, 1, 1, None)

  ```
* Integer / buffer overflow in imageop module:
  ```

  import imageop
  s = ''
  imageop.crop(s, 1, 65536, 65536, 0, 0, 65536, 65536)

  ```
* Integer overflow in string expandtabs operation:
  ```

  s = 't\tt\t'
  str.expandtabs(s, 2147483647)

  ```
* Integer overflow in rgbimagemodule.c (example bad code):
  ```

                  tablen = ysize * zsize * sizeof(Py_Int32);
                  starttab = (Py_Int32 *)malloc(tablen);
  ...
                  rv = PyString_FromStringAndSize((char *) 0,
                                             (xsize*ysize+TAGLEN)*sizeof(Py_Int32)

  ```
Integer overflow in string concatenation (only affecting pre-2.5 versions of
Python):
```

s = 'A' * 2147483647
s2 = s + s + 'AA'

```
* Memory corruption unpickling. Sample evil pickle buffers

c. Third party library update for ntp.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0 have a ntp client that is affected by the
following security issue. Note that the same security issue is
present in the ESX Service Console as described in section d. of
this advisory.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
The NTP security issue identified by CVE-2009-0159 is not relevant
for ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
in this component (column 4) if a solution is available.

d. Service Console update for ntp

Service Console package ntp updated to version ntp-4.2.2pl-9el5\_3.2
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
The Service Console present in ESX is affected by the following
security issues.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
NTP authentication is not enabled by default on the Service Console.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
A buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A
malicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an
ntpq request that could crash ntpq or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ntpq
command.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0159 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
in the Service Console (column 4) if a solution is available.

f. Updated Service Console package python

Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.
When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service.
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service.
An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721
CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143

g. Updated Service Console package bind

Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5
The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
is operating correctly.
A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.

#####

h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
files.

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these
issues.

i. Updated Service Console package curl

Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5\_3.5
A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.

j. Updated Service Console package gnutls

Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5\_3.5
A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially
confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
