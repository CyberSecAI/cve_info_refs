The provided content is a security bulletin for multiple TYPO3 extensions, which is relevant to the provided CVE ID.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities are primarily due to SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues present in the various third-party extensions for TYPO3.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  Multiple extensions including JobControl, Econda Plugin, Frontend Users View, Mannschaftsliste, M1 Intern, and Simple survey are vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The Page Improvements extension is vulnerable to XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This may lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. It could also allow for complete compromise of the application and the underlying system.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities performed in the context of a legitimate user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** Exploiting unsanitized user inputs in the affected extensions can inject SQL code into database queries.
- **XSS:** Injecting malicious scripts in the vulnerable parameter of the affected extension, which will be executed in the browsers of other users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to identify vulnerable parameters in the affected TYPO3 extensions, where user inputs are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries (for SQL injection) or echoed back into the user interface (for XSS).
- The attacker needs to have the ability to send malicious input to the vulnerable application, either via web interface or through some other mechanism.
