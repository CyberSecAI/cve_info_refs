The provided content relates to CVE-2008-4659.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerabilities stem from SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaws in several third-party TYPO3 extensions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple extensions were found to have SQL injection vulnerabilities. These are present in:
    *   JobControl (dmmjobcontrol)
    *   Econda Plugin (econda)
    *   Frontend Users View (feusersview)
    *   Mannschaftsliste (kiddog\_playerlist)
    *  M1 Intern (m1\_intern)
    *  Simple survey (simplesurvey)
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** One extension was found to have an XSS vulnerability.
    * Page Improvements (sm\_pageimprovements)

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the application's data.
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This could result in actions like session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vectors for SQL injection are through the vulnerable parameters and inputs within the listed extensions that are not properly sanitized when used to construct database queries.
*   The attack vector for XSS is through the vulnerable inputs within the Page Improvements extension that are not properly sanitized when rendered on the client side.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   For both SQL injection and XSS, the attacker needs to be able to access the TYPO3 application, either directly or indirectly.
*   For SQL injection, the attacker needs to identify the input fields or parameters that are vulnerable to SQL injection and craft malicious SQL statements.
*   For XSS, the attacker needs to identify the input fields or parameters that are vulnerable to XSS and craft malicious javascript or HTML code.
