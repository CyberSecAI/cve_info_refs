#### Safari 4.0

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1704

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Downloaded image files may be misidentified as HTML, leading to JavaScript execution without warning the user

  Description: Image files are 'safe' types that, once downloaded, are displayed by Safari without warning the user. An issue in Safari may cause it to be unable to identify the file type of certain local image files. In this case, Safari will examine the content of those files and may treat them as HTML. If a file contains JavaScript, it will be executed in the local context. For a downloaded file, this should not occur without first prompting the user. This issue is addressed by treating files of unknown type as generic binary data, and by correctly identifying the image file types known to have this issue. Credit to Sergio 'shadown' Alvarez of Recurity Labs GmbH for reporting this issue.

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1716

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: A local user may be able to read the contents of files being downloaded by other users

  Description: CFNetwork creates temporary files insecurely when downloading. A local user may be able to access another user's files as they are downloaded, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by downloading files to the user's secure temporary directory location. For Mac OS X systems, this issue is addressed in Mac OS X v10.5.6. Credit to Billy Rios and Microsoft Vulnerability Research for reporting this issue.

* **International Components for Unicode**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0153

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Maliciously crafted content may bypass website filters and result in cross-site scripting

  Description: An implementation issue exists in ICU's handling of certain character encodings. Using ICU to convert invalid byte sequences to Unicode may result in over-consumption, where trailing bytes are considered part of the original character. This may be leveraged by an attacker to bypass filters on websites that attempt to mitigate cross-site scripting. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of invalid byte sequences. For Mac OS X v10.5 systems, this issue is addressed in Mac OS X v10.5.7. Credit to Chris Weber of Casaba Security for reporting this issue.

* **libxml**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-3281, CVE-2008-3529, CVE-2008-4409, CVE-2008-4225, CVE-2008-4226

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in libxml2 version 2.6.16

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in libxml2 version 2.6.16, the most serious of which may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. On Windows, the issues are addressed by updating libxml2 to version 2.7.3. On Mac OS X v10.4.11 and Mac OS X v10.5.7, the issues are addressed by applying the relevant patches.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1682

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Visiting a website with a revoked EV certificate may not display a certificate warning

  Description: An issue in Safari's handling of Extended Validation (EV) certificates may cause the revocation checking to be bypassed. This would allow a page to be loaded without issuing a warning for a revoked EV certificate. This update addresses the issue through improved revocation checking for EV certificates. Credit to Bruce Morton for reporting this issue.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1706

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Cookies set during a private browsing session may remain after private browsing ends

  Description: Safari's Private Browsing feature is designed to allow users to browse without leaving evidence of the browser session on disk. An implementation issue in Private Browsing may cause cookies to remain on disk after Private Browsing ends. This may result in an unexpected disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by removing cookies from the alternate cookie store when private browsing is disabled, or Safari quits. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems. Credit to Michael Hay of Beatnik Monkey Software for reporting this issue.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1707

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: "Reset Safari" may not immediately remove website passwords from memory

  Description: After clicking the "Reset" button for "Reset saved names and passwords" in the "Reset Safari..." menu option, Safari may take up to 30 seconds to clear the passwords. A user with access to the system in that time window may be able to access the stored credentials. This issue is addressed by resolving the race condition that leads to the delay. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems. Credit to Philippe Couturier of izypage.com, and Andrew Wellington of The Australian National University for reporting this issue.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1708

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to the disclosure of local file content or arbitrary code execution

  Description: An issue in Safari's open-help-anchor URL handler may allow a maliciously crafted website to open local help files. This may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue by preventing remote sites from calling the open-help-anchor URL handler. Credit to Billy Rios and Microsoft Vulnerability Research for reporting this issue.

* **Safari Windows Installer**

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Safari may run with elevated privileges

  Description: The Safari installer includes a checkbox to launch Safari immediately after installation. If this checkbox is checked, the compression method in the installer will cause Safari to run with elevated privileges for its initial launch. The issue is addressed by using a different compression method in the installer. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems. Credit to Dave English of Lutnos for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2006-2783

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: WebKit ignores Unicode byte order mark sequences when parsing web pages. Certain websites and web content filters attempt to sanitize input by blocking specific HTML tags. This approach to filtering may be bypassed and lead to cross-site scripting when encountering maliciously-crafted HTML tags containing byte order mark sequences. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of byte order mark sequences. Credit to Chris Weber of Casaba Security, LLC for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-1588

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Unicode ideographic spaces may be used to spoof a website

  Description: When Safari displays the current URL in the address bar, Unicode ideographic spaces are rendered. This allows a maliciously crafted website to direct the user to a spoofed site that visually appears to be a legitimate domain. This update addresses the issue by not rendering Unicode ideographic spaces in the address bar.

taken on these products are described
below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CMS | R13/R13.1, R14/R14.1, R15 | Low | Customers on CMS version R13 must first upgrade to R13.1 then apply patch 114014-22 to resolve this issue.  Customers on CMS version R14 must first upgrade to R14.1 then apply patch 114014-22 to resolve this issue. Customers on CMS version R15, apply patch 125731-04 to resolve this issue. |
| Avaya IR | 3.0, 4.0 | Low | IR does not use or support the affected libxml2 library routines. Therefore Avaya will not verify the patch for use with IR |

**Recommended Actions:**

Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

linked against libxml2 to enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2008-4225](/security/CVE-2008-4225))

Drew Yao discovered that libxml2 did not correctly handle large memory

allocations. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

very large XML document, a remote attacker could cause applications linked

against libxml2 to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-4226](/security/CVE-2008-4226))

# libxml2: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200812-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libxml2 might lead to execution of arbitrary
code or Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libxml2** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.7.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.7.2-r1** |

### Background

libxml2 is the XML (eXtended Markup Language) C parser and toolkit
initially developed for the Gnome project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were reported in libxml2:

* Andreas Solberg reported that libxml2 does not properly detect
  recursion during entity expansion in an attribute value
  (CVE-2008-3281).
* A heap-based buffer overflow has been reported in the
  xmlParseAttValueComplex() function in parser.c (CVE-2008-3529).
* Christian Weiske reported that predefined entity definitions in
  entities are not properly handled (CVE-2008-4409).
* Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported an integer overflow in the
  xmlBufferResize() function that can lead to an infinite loop
  (CVE-2008-4225).
* Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported an integer overflow in the
  xmlSAX2Characters() function leading to a memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-4226).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to open a
specially crafted XML document with an application using libxml2,
possibly resulting in the exeution of arbitrary code or a high CPU and
memory consumption.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libxml2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.7.2-r1"
```

##### 1. Summary

Updated ESX patches address an issue loading corrupt virtual disks and update Service Console packages for net-snmp and libxml2.

#####

##### 2. Relevant Releases

VMware ESXi 3.5 without patch ESXe350-200901401-I-SG

VMware ESX 3.5 without patches  ESX350-200901401-SG,
ESX350-200901409-SG,
ESX350-200901410-SG

VMware ESX 3.0.3 without patches ESX303-200901405-SG,

VMware ESX 3.0.2 without patches ESX-1007673,
 ESX-1007674

VMware ESX 2.5.5 before patch 12

NOTE: Extended support for ESX 3.5 Update 1 ends on 7/25/2009, users should plan to upgrade to at least ESX 3.5 Update 2 by that time.

Extended support for ESX 3.0.2 Update 1 ends on 2009-08-08. Users should plan to upgrade to ESX 3.0.3 and preferably to the newest release available.

Extended support for ESX 2.5.5 ends on 2010-06-15. Users should plan to upgrade to ESX 3.0.3 and preferably to the newest release available.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. Loading a corrupt delta disk may cause ESX to crash
If the VMDK delta disk of a snapshot is corrupt, an ESX host might crash when the corrupted disk is loaded. VMDK delta files exist for virtual machines with one or more snapshots. This change ensures that a corrupt VMDK delta file cannot be used to crash ESX hosts.

A corrupt VMDK delta disk, or virtual machine would have to be loaded by an administrator.

VMware would like to thank Craig Marshall for reporting this issue.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4914 to this issue.

The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

#####

b. Updated Service Console package net-snmp
Net-SNMP is an implementation of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP is used by network management systems to monitor hosts.

A denial-of-service flaw was found in the way Net-SNMP processes SNMP GETBULK requests. A remote attacker who issued a specially-crafted request could cause the snmpd server to crash.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4309 to this issue.

\* hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

#####

c. Updated Service Console package libxml2
An integer overflow flaw causing a heap-based buffer overflow was found in the libxml2 XML parser. If an application linked against libxml2 processed untrusted, malformed XML content, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4226 to this issue.

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the libxml2 XML parser. If an application linked against libxml2 processed untrusted, malformed XML content, it could cause the application to enter an infinite loop.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4225 to this issue.

Package        : libxml2
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-4225 CVE-2008-4226

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GNOME XML library.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2008-4225

    Drew Yao discovered that missing input sanitising in the
    xmlBufferResize() function may lead to an infinite loop,
    resulting in denial of service.

CVE-2008-4226

    Drew Yao discovered that an integer overflow in the
    xmlSAX2Characters() function may lead to denial of service or
    the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.27.dfsg-6.

For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2008:0988 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: libxml2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0988)

## Topic

Updated libxml2 packages that fix security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, and 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

libxml2 is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. It includes
support for reading, modifying, and writing XML and HTML files.

An integer overflow flaw causing a heap-based buffer overflow was found in
the libxml2 XML parser. If an application linked against libxml2 processed
untrusted, malformed XML content, it could cause the application to crash
or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-4226)

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the libxml2 XML parser. If an
application linked against libxml2 processed untrusted, malformed XML
content, it could cause the application to enter an infinite loop.
(CVE-2008-4225)

Red Hat would like to thank Drew Yao of the Apple Product Security team for
reporting these issues.

Users of libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

libxml2 security update (RHSA-2008-0988)

Original Release Date: January 5, 2009

Last Revised: July 1, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-002

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

libxml2 is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. It
includes
support for reading, modifying, and writing XML and HTML files.

An integer overflow flaw causing a heap-based buffer overflow was
found in
the libxml2 XML parser. If an application linked against libxml2
processed
untrusted, malformed XML content, it could cause the application to
crash
or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2008-4226](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4226) to this issue.

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the libxml2 XML parser. If
an
application linked against libxml2 processed untrusted, malformed XML
content, it could cause the application to enter an infinite loop.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name [CVE-2008-4225](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4225) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0988.html>

Avaya has rated this as a Low risk level as either the package is
installed but not used by any application or exploitation would require
direct non-standard user interaction.

**Recommended Actions:**
For all vulnerable system products,
Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied by RedHat Linux.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
