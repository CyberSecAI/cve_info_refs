Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Moodle, an online
course management system. The following issues are addressed in this
update, ranging from cross site scripting to remote code execution.

Various cross site scripting issues in the Moodle codebase
(CVE-2008-3326, CVE-2008-3325, CVE-2007-3555, CVE-2008-5432,
MSA-08-0021, MDL-8849, MDL-12793, MDL-11414, MDL-14806,
MDL-10276).

Various cross site request forgery issues in the Moodle codebase
(CVE-2008-3325, MSA-08-0023).

Privilege escalation bugs in the Moodle codebase (MSA-08-0001, MDL-7755).

SQL injection issue in the hotpot module (MSA-08-0010).

An embedded copy of Smarty had several vulnerabilities
(CVE-2008-4811, CVE-2008-4810).
An embedded copy of Snoopy was vulnerable to cross site scripting
(CVE-2008-4796).
An embedded copy of Kses was vulnerable to cross site scripting
(CVE-2008-1502).

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.3-2+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.2.dfsg-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your moodle (1.6.3-2+etch1) package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the

Subject: Regarding SA32329 (Smarty "_expand_quoted_text()" Security Bypass)

Hi,

unfortunately, Secunia does not list any references for SA32329 [1].
Apparantly, they are refering to the last three commits to
libs/Smarty_Compiler.class.php, r2781:2797 [2].

However, this issue is not fixed in 2.6.20, and I could not find a
2.6.20-1 release. I have no idea where this version information comes
from.

It might be worthwhile to check applications that bundle smarty, like
tikiwiki, gallery 2 or PEAR-PhpDocumentor.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
