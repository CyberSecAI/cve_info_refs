  "CVE-2008-4934": {
    "description": "Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfsplus filesystem. Local users who have been granted the privileges necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted filesystem that results in a kernel oops due to an unchecked return value.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `read_mapping_page()` function's return value is passed on to `kmap` without being checked. If `read_mapping_page()` fails and returns an error, `kmap` can trigger a kernel oops when called with the error value, leading to a denial of service.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unchecked return value",
        "Incorrect error handling"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service (kernel crash)",
      "attack_vector": "Mounting a specially crafted, corrupted HFS+ filesystem.",
       "required_capabilities": "Local user with the ability to mount filesystems."
