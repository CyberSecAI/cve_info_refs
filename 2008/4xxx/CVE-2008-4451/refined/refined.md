  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies within the ESET SysInspector driver (esiasdrv.sys) where a specific IO Control Code (IOCTL_METHOD_NEIGHTER) does not handle output buffer properly, which leads to memory corruption.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of output buffer during IOCTL leading to memory corruption",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (BSOD)",
    "Attack vectors": "Local",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user able to send IOCTL requests to the device driver"
