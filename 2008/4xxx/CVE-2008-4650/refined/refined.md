Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4650

**Vulnerable Software:** myEvent 1.6

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `viewevent.php` file. Specifically, the `eventdate` parameter obtained from the GET request is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is SQL injection. By manipulating the `eventdate` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data from the database.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
- **Potential System Takeover:** In some scenarios, an attacker could potentially gain control of the server by exploiting the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out via an HTTP GET request targeting the `viewevent.php` file.
- **`eventdate` Parameter:** The `eventdate` parameter within the query string is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
```php
$sql = "SELECT  * FROM event WHERE  date = '$eventdate'" ;
$results = mysql_query($sql) or die("Cannot query the database.<br>" . mysql_error());
```
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):**
```
/viewevent.php?eventdate='[foo]
```
- **Exploit Example:**
```
/viewevent.php?eventdate='+union+all+select+1,1,concat(user(),char(32,35),database(),char(32,35),version())/*
```
- This exploit uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to extract database user, database name, and database version.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit uses the deprecated `mysql_*` functions, which are known to be vulnerable and should not be used in modern PHP applications.
- The exploit leverages the `concat()` function to concatenate different values and `char(32,35)` to add spaces and # characters in the output, it is also common to see `0x20` instead of `char(32)` and `0x23` instead of `char(35)`.
