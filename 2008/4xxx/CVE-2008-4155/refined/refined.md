        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows inclusion of arbitrary files via crafted 'module', 'ss_module' or 'ss_action' parameters.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive data like configuration files, source code, or other restricted files. Also, the attacker can view folder contents.",
        "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests with manipulated 'module', 'ss_module' or 'ss_action' parameters. Example: http://localhost/www/index.php?module=../../../../autoexec.bat%00",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific position within the network is required."
