```
- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
  - **Remote File Inclusion:** Improper sanitization of the `rel_path` parameter in `config.php`, allowing inclusion of arbitrary files.
  - **File info disclosure:** Lack of access control on `info.php`, enabling direct access from a browser.
  - **Blind SQL Injection:** Insufficient input validation of the `category` parameter in `search.php`, allowing manipulation of SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
  - Information Disclosure
  - Blind SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - **Remote File Inclusion:** Arbitrary code execution by including malicious files.
  - **File info disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive server information.
  - **Blind SQL Injection:** Extraction of usernames and passwords from the database.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - **Remote File Inclusion:** HTTP GET request to `config.php` with a malicious `rel_path` parameter.
  - **File info disclosure:** Direct access via HTTP GET request to `info.php`.
  - **Blind SQL Injection:** HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a malicious `category` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. For RFI the php "register_globals" needs to be enabled.
