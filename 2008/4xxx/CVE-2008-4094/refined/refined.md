Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-4094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `:limit` and `:offset` parameters used in SQL queries within Ruby on Rails versions prior to 2.1.1. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code through these parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. User-controlled input is directly used in SQL queries without proper escaping or sanitization.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly validate or escape the values provided for the `:limit` and `:offset` parameters before using them in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands by injecting malicious code into the `:limit` or `:offset` parameters.
*   **Data Disclosure:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including passwords and other private data.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Database Manipulation:** In some cases, it might be possible to drop tables or perform other harmful database operations (although this might be limited by database configuration, such as MySQL's default setting to disallow multiple SQL statements).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the application's URL parameters or any other input mechanism that allows a user to control the `:limit` and `:offset` values used in database queries.
*   Specifically, if the application allows user input to directly influence these parameters, it's susceptible to the vulnerability.  For example: `User.find(:all, :limit => params[:limit], :offset => params[:offset])`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the `:limit` and `:offset` parameters, typically through a web interface or API that exposes these parameters.
*   **Understanding of Database Schema:** To exploit the vulnerability effectively for information disclosure (e.g. via UNION statements), the attacker needs to know or guess the table and column names of the database.
*   **No authentication needed:** This vulnerability can be exploited by any user that can influence the limit and offset parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability primarily affects PostgreSQL and SQLite databases. MySQL's default configuration to disallow multiple statements limits the impact, though information disclosure is still possible.
*   The `will_paginate` gem is noted as *not* being affected due to proper escaping of values.
*   Patches were released to address the issue for affected Rails versions.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Rails version 2.1.1 and backported to 2.0.5
