# SQL Injection issue in :limit and :offset parameter

 Filed under [Uncategorized](https://rorsecurity.info/journal/category/uncategorized)

An SQL Injection vulnerability [has been found](http://blog.innerewut.de/2008/6/16/why-you-should-upgrade-to-rails-2-1) in Rails. The issue affects Rails < 2.1.1, namely the :limit and :offset parameters that are not correctly sanitized:

> Person.find(:all, :limit => “10; DROP TABLE users;”)

A possible attack will work only if you allow the user control these two values as in User.find(:all, :limit => 10, :offset => params[:offset]). Note that will\_paginate is not affected, it escapes the values before.

This seemed to affect only PostgreSQL and SQLite as MySQL by default disallows multiple SQL statements. So you cannot drop a table. However, it could be used for information disclosure. Consider the [UNION](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/de/union.html) SQL statement:

> User.find(:all, :limit => params[:limit])

> params[:limit] #= “1 UNION (select 1,2,password,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 from users)”

What does this mean? The result is the full users table, with one small modification: One field contains the user’s password and the other fields are always a number between 0 and 9. Let’s assume the third column is the user’s first name and the application returns everything it found. This means an attacker may read the user’s password in the first name field. All he has to do is find out about the table names (take a look at the controller names), the column names (review the HTML source, guessing) and the number of columns in the table (try it). The UNION statement will work only if the second table has the same number of columns as the first one – hence the list of numbers.

Of course there might not be a password column in clear text, but this could be used to read any data from the database, or even other databases.

**Countermeasures**

* Review your application whether you allow the user to control :limit or :offset
* If you are on Rails 2.1.0, please apply [this patch](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/288) or get Rails 2.1.1
* If you are on the Rails 2.0 or 1.2 branch, apply this [backport patch](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/964-fix-for-sql-injection-on-limit-and-offset-should-be-backported)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

## Fix for SQL injection on :limit and :offset should be backported

Reported by [Jon Leighton](/users/11330) |
September 3rd, 2008 @ 03:51 PM
| in [2.0.3](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/milestones/9902-2-0-3)

The fix in [#288](/projects/8994/tickets/288 "Ticket #288") is a serious security vulnerability and
should be backported to all stable branches.

  #### [Jon Leighton](/users/11330) [September 3rd, 2008 @ 04:08 PM](#ticket-964-4)

  More info about the problem on this blog post: [http://blog.innerewut.de/2008/6/...](http://blog.innerewut.de/2008/6/16/why-you-should-upgrade-to-rails-2-1)

  The facts we have:

  + The problem is fixed in the abstract adapter for 2.1.0
  + The problem is *not* fixed for the 2.0 or 1.2
    branches
  + The problem is *not* fixed for the mysql adapter for
    2.1.0, but *will* be fixed when 2.1.1 is released. This is
    not such a huge issue as mysql stops more than one query being sent
    at once

  So basically it's not a huge issue that the mysql adapter fix
  hasn't been released for the 2.1 branch, but no fix at all has been
  released for the other branches and so they are both
  vulnerable.

  We surveyed folks a while back. Pretty much nobody is affected
  by this. I agree it's backport-worthy, but it's not a crisis.

  Care to backport it?

  #### [Jon Leighton](/users/11330) [September 4th, 2008 @ 07:41 AM](#ticket-964-6)

  What's the criteria for a security issue being considered a
  "priority"? I run with postgres on the 2.0 branch, which means my
  application would be vulnerable if we were using user-specified
  offset/limit. Granted a very small number of people run
  postgres/sqlite compared to mysql, and presumably a smaller number
  still allow the user to specify limit/offset, but it seems this
  *could* affect somebody, and would be quite serious for them
  if they were targeted.

  Anyway, I'd be happy to backport it, will report back with a
  patch.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- squirrelmail
Insufficient input checks could allow remote attackers to conduct a
cross site scripting (XSS) attack (CVE-2008-2379).
Affected Prodcuts: 10.3
- gnutls
gnutls did not properly verify x509 certificate chains. An attacker
could exploit that to trick client programs into trusting servers
that would normally get rejected (CVE-2008-4989).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.3, 11.0
- rubygem-activerecord
Missing sanity checks of the :limit and :offset parameters in SQL
queries could potentially be exploited to conduct SQL injection
attacks (CVE-2008-4094).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- rubygem-actionpack
Missing input sanitation in rubygem-actionpack allowed remote
attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers via specially crafted
URLs (CVE-2008-5189).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- samba
Malicious clients could potentially retrieve arbitrary memory
content from a samba server (CVE-2008-4314).
Affected Products: SLES10, 11.0
- dbus-1
Local users could crash services connected to the D-bus
(CVE-2008-3834).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- pdns
Remote attackers could crash pdnsd if the daemon was configured with
distributor-threads=1. With the default configuration pdns is not
affected by this problem (CVE-2008-5277).
Affected Products: 10.3, 11.0
- php5
The php imap module used an old API of the imap client library. The
library aborts programs that use too large buffers. Specially
crafted emails could therefore crash php applications that use imap
(CVE-2008-2829).
Affected Products: 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- pam\_krb5
Insufficient file access permissions checks allowed users to read
Kerberos tickets of other users if pam\_krb5 was configured with the
option "existing\_ticket" (CVE-2008-3825).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
