Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2008-4298:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak exists in the `http_request_parse` function within `request.c` of lighttpd. This occurs when a duplicate request header is encountered, and the function returns without freeing previously allocated memory for the header.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The failure to release allocated memory when handling duplicate headers leads to a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By sending a large number of requests containing duplicate headers, an attacker can force the server to consume excessive memory, potentially leading to a crash or unresponsiveness.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable lighttpd server. No specific authentication or elevated privileges are mentioned.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the server receives a request containing duplicate headers.
- The fix involves correctly freeing the allocated memory when such duplicate headers are encountered.
- The vulnerability was fixed in lighttpd version 1.4.20.
- A patch (`lighttpd-1.4.x_request_header_memleak.patch`) was made available for those who could not upgrade immediately.
