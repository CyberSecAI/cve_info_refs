How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: Fwd: [Full-disclosure] [PLSA 2008-36] Ffmpeg: Multiple
	vulnerabilities

Was looking at the latest ffmpeg issue (CVE-2008-3230) to see if there
were any patches and found this in my inbox as not dealt with yet.
There are no CVE identifiers for any of these issues that I can see.
I'm not sure how many of these issues would be considered security
sensitive/exploitable, but Pardus had issued an advisory and the
references contain the patches to fix them, but even searching on
MITRE's web site shows no ffmpeg CVEs that I've missed.

Do these need CVE identifiers?

# FFmpeg: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200903-33**

Multiple vulnerabilities in FFmpeg may lead to the remote execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/ffmpeg** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.4.9\_p20090201** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.4.9\_p20090201** |

| Package | **media-plugins/gst-plugins-ffmpeg** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.10.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.5** |

| Package | **media-video/mplayer** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0\_rc2\_p28450** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0\_rc2\_p28450** |

### Background

FFmpeg is a complete solution to record, convert and stream audio and
video. gst-plugins-ffmpeg is a FFmpeg based gstreamer plugin which
includes a vulnerable copy of FFmpeg code. Mplayer is a multimedia
player which also includes a vulnerable copy of the code.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in FFmpeg:

* astrange
  reported a stack-based buffer overflow in the str\_read\_packet() in
  libavformat/psxstr.c when processing .str files (CVE-2008-3162).
* Multiple buffer overflows in libavformat/utils.c
  (CVE-2008-4866).
* A buffer overflow in libavcodec/dca.c
  (CVE-2008-4867).
* An unspecified vulnerability in the
  avcodec\_close() function in libavcodec/utils.c (CVE-2008-4868).
* Unspecified memory leaks (CVE-2008-4869).
* Tobias Klein
  repoerted a NULL pointer dereference due to an integer signedness error
  in the fourxm\_read\_header() function in libavformat/4xm.c
  (CVE-2009-0385).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted media
file, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All FFmpeg users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/ffmpeg-0.4.9_p20090201"
```

All gst-plugins-ffmpeg users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-plugins/gst-plugins-ffmpeg-0.10.5"
```

All Mplayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_rc2_p28450"
```
