      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_8be8d57e_20250125_125151.html",
      "root_cause": "Heap corruption due to improper handling of CWD and LIST commands.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap corruption vulnerability"
      ],
       "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) by corrupting the heap, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a specially crafted CWD command followed by a LIST command to the FTP server."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server and authenticate (anonymous login is sufficient).",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a long string in the CWD command, followed by any string in the LIST command. Overwritten registers during free() function are ecx and edi. This could allow a determined attacker to overwrite return addresses to gain code execution."
