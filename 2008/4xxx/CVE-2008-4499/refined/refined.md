Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability present in the `main.php` and `edit.php` files of PHPWebExplorer version 0.09b. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `refer` and `file` parameters, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application directly includes files based on user-provided paths without proper validation or sanitization.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `refer` and `file` parameters in `main.php` and `edit.php` respectively are not validated, allowing directory traversal sequences like `../../../etc` to be used.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  Although not a direct vulnerability within the application itself, the content suggests a way to potentially gain admin privileges by creating a PHP session setting script. This vulnerability relies on a shared server environment allowing arbitrary file creation and execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, potentially gaining user credentials and system information.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By creating and executing a custom PHP script, an attacker can potentially set session variables to gain admin level access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting HTTP GET requests to `main.php` and `edit.php` with malicious `refer` and `file` parameters respectively.
    * `http://localhost/main.php?refer=d&d=../../../etc`
    * `http://localhost/edit.php?file=../../../etc/passwd`
*   **Abuse of Shared Hosting:** In a shared server environment, an attacker can potentially gain admin privileges by creating and executing a custom PHP session script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Ability to create files:** In certain scenarios (shared hosting), the attacker needs the ability to create and execute files on the server. This is only to potentially gain admin privileges by manipulating sessions.
*   **Basic Understanding of LFI:** An understanding of LFI vulnerabilities and how to use directory traversal is required.

**Additional Notes:**

* The version of the affected software is noted as "0.99b" in the content however the title and reference of the vulnerability states it applies to version "0.09b".
