```
Root cause of vulnerability: lighttpd versions before 1.4.20 do not decode the URL before matching it against rewrite and redirect patterns.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass rewrite/redirect rules by encoding parts of the URL. This can lead to information disclosure and/or manipulation of data if rewrite/redirect rules are used to protect certain resources.
Impact of exploitation: Attackers can gain unintended access to resources that should have been protected by rewrite or redirect rules, potentially leading to information disclosure or data manipulation.
Attack vectors: The attack vector is remote, via HTTP requests with specially crafted URLs that include URL-encoded characters.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
