How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1.4.20 has been released meanwhile. The issues along with their
advisories are public now, CC'ing oss-sec as such.
We still need CVEs for these three issues.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- libxml2
An integer overflow in libxml2 could lead to memory corruption and
arbitrary code execution (CVE-2008-4226).

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

 Warning
---------
This "fix" caused many regressions and was reverted!
Bypass rewrite/redirect rules with encoded urls
=================================================
Description
-------------
lighttpd 1.4.19, and possibly other versions before 1.5.0, does not decode
the url before matching against rewrite and redirect patterns, which allows
attackers to bypass rewrites rules. this can be a security problem in
certain configurations if these rules are used to hide certain urls.
http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/ticket/1720
Affected versions
-------------------
all versions before 1.4.20 (1.5 before r2310)
Fixed in
----------
1.4.x: http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/changeset/2278 (rewrite)
1.4.x: http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/changeset/2308 (redirect)
trunk: http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/changeset/2307 (rewrite)
trunk: http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/changeset/2310 (redirect)
Solutions or Workaround
-------------------------
Don't build your security on rewrites. Upgrade to 1.4.20 or apply
lighttpd-1.4.x\_rewrite\_redirect\_decode\_url.patch
This bug is tracked as CVE-2008-4359.

### Rewrite/redirect rules and URL encoding

Added by Anonymous [over 16 years](/projects/lighttpd/activity?from=2008-07-14 "2008-07-14 10:17") ago.

**Description**

Dear lighty community,

I am using lighty to serve a wiki; to have nice urls, i use the following in my lighttpd.conf:

```

url.rewrite-once = ( "^/wiki/(.*)$" => "/wiki/awki.cgi/$1" )

```

and so i was hoping that everything going through /wiki/ would be interpreted by the script 'awki.cgi'. However, if I url-encode a part of the url, the above rewrite rule does not apply: if I ask my browser to access /wik%69/, lighty does not execute the script and gives me a
listing of files in that directory!

Is there a way to avoid that?
I asked in the forum last week but, as I had no answer, I decided to open a ticket; I apologize if this is unapropriate.

#### Updated by Anonymous [over 16 years](/projects/lighttpd/activity?from=2008-08-02 "2008-08-02 15:07") ago

I've come up with the following workaround:

```

url.rewrite-once = ( "^/wiki/(.*)$" => "/wiki/awki.cgi/$1" )

$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/wiki" {
  $HTTP["url"] !~ "^/wiki/awki.cgi/" {
    url.access-deny = ("")
  }
}

```

It works because the $HTTP["url"] condition is evaluated after the URL is parsed (so all url-encoded characters are hopefully replaced); well, unless I'm mistaken.

* **Status** changed from *New* to *Fixed*
* **Resolution** set to *fixed*

Should be fixed in r2278. Just for reference, in your case you consider this a security issue since it allows for unwanted disclosure of information.
Not sure if we are going to handle it as one, but I guess it should be at least noted.

stbuehler committed the fix and didn't close this ticket as trac was broken, so I'm doing that now. All kudos to him in any case. :p

mod\_redirect had similar problems:

Summary for now:

We are not sure yet what to do, maybe we won't fix this at all.

* **Status** changed from *Reopened* to *Need Feedback*

con->request.uri is url-encoded and includes URI path and query-string
con->uri.path has been url-decoded and path has been simplified/normalized
con->uri.query is url-encoded

mod\_rewrite operates on con->request.uri, meaning that there might be ways to subvert rewrite rules by url-encoding parts of it, since most rewrite rules will be against a normalized path and query string.

Perhaps the solution is to normalize the url-encoding of con->request.uri for rewrite rules, but there might still be complexities involved in virtual paths containing '.' or '..', PATH\_INFO, whether or not to decode %2F ('/') in path and/or query-string parts, ...

I propose normalizing the url-encoding, including decoding %2F to '/'. Decoding %2F to '/' potentially loses some info in PATH\_INFO and query string, but is a more secure default giving most people what they would expect. Maybe we could additionally provide a config switch to skip decode of %2F for the regex input.

Note: I am suggesting decoding con->request.uri *temporarily* for the regex match. If we were to normalize url-encoding at the start of the request, I would suggest leaving %2F url-encoded at that point of normalization. We might still decode %2F for regex matching, unless a new config flag were set.

(While discussing url-decoding here, please see url-encoding discussion of regex back-reference matches in [#911](/issues/911 "Bug: Need for URL encoding in mod_redirect and possibly mod_rewrite (Fixed)"))

See [server.http-parseopts](/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Server_http-parseoptsDetails) documentation for how to enable URL normalization (recommended)

For backwards compatibility, URL normalization is not enabled by default, though that may change in a future release.

# lighttpd: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200812-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities in lighttpd may lead to information disclosure or
a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/lighttpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.20** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.20** |

### Background

lighttpd is a lightweight high-performance web server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in lighttpd:

* Qhy reported a memory leak in the http\_request\_parse() function in
  request.c (CVE-2008-4298).
* Gaetan Bisson reported that URIs are not decoded before applying
  url.redirect and url.rewrite rules (CVE-2008-4359).
* Anders1 reported that mod\_userdir performs case-sensitive comparisons
  on filename components in configuration options, which is insufficient
  when case-insensitive filesystems are used (CVE-2008-4360).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a Denial
of Service, to bypass intended access restrictions, to obtain sensitive
information, or to possibly modify data.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All lighttpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/lighttpd-1.4.20"
```
### References

* [CVE-2008-4298](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4298)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : lighttpd
Vulnerability  : various
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: No
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-4298 CVE-2008-4359 CVE-2008-4360

Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd,
a fast webserver with minimal memory footprint.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2008-4298
    A memory leak in the http_request_parse function could be used by
    remote attackers to cause lighttpd to consume memory, and cause a
    denial of service attack.

CVE-2008-4359
    Inconsistent handling of URL patterns could lead to the disclosure
    of resources a server administrator did not anticipate when using
    rewritten URLs.

CVE-2008-4360
    Upon file systems which don't handle case-insensitive paths differently
    it might be possible that unanticipated resources could be made available
    by mod_userdir.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
1.4.13-4etch11.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed shortly.

We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
