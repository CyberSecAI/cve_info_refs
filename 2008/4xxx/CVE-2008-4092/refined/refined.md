  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the `printfeature.php` file, specifically the `artid` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information (like administrator credentials), modification of data, or complete compromise of the database.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is remote, requiring only an HTTP request to a vulnerable page with a manipulated `artid` parameter."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not require any specific authentication or privileges. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server."

  "affected_versions": "myPHPNuke versions prior to 1.8.8_8rc2 are vulnerable. While 1.8.8_8rc2 includes additional filters, limited SQL Injection attacks are still possible without spaces or brackets.",
