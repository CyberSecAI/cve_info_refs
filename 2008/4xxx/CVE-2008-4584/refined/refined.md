Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4584:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the insecure method `SaveLastError` within the Chilkat Mail ActiveX control (specifically `ChilkatCert.dll` version 7.8). This method allows a remote attacker to write arbitrary data to a file on the user's system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Method:** The `SaveLastError` method is not properly secured and can be misused.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** The method allows an attacker to specify a file path on the user's system where data can be written.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Partial Confidentiality Impact:** The attacker can potentially overwrite files which might contain sensitive information.
- **Partial Integrity Impact:** The attacker can overwrite arbitrary files, potentially modifying or corrupting system or user files.
- **Partial Availability Impact:**  If critical system files are overwritten, this could lead to system instability or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** This vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a website using Internet Explorer.
- **ActiveX Control:** The attack relies on the vulnerable Chilkat ActiveX control being installed on the user's system.
- **VBScript:** The provided exploit uses VBScript to call the vulnerable method within the ActiveX control, demonstrating how the attack can be executed via a web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the internet.
- **Victim with Vulnerable ActiveX Control:** The victim needs to have the vulnerable Chilkat Mail ActiveX control (ChilkatCert.dll version 7.8) installed.
- **Internet Explorer:** The victim must use Internet Explorer (version 6 was specifically tested).
- **Ability to host malicious code:** The attacker must be able to host a web page containing the malicious VBScript and ActiveX call.

**Technical Details:**
The provided VBScript code snippet demonstrates the exploit:
```vbscript
<object classid='clsid:2A9A3D40-2F32-45BF-9A89-AC9ED6C2FEDF' id='over' align="left"></object>
<input language=VBScript onclick=lose() type=button value="Exploit">
<script language='vbscript'>
Sub lose
mystr="c:\darkl0rd.txt"
over.SaveLastError mystr
MyMsg = MsgBox("Done !")
End Sub
</script>
```
This code:
1. Creates an instance of the vulnerable ActiveX control using its CLSID.
2. Defines a `lose` subroutine called when the button is clicked.
3. In the `lose` subroutine, a file path `"c:\darkl0rd.txt"` is defined and the `SaveLastError` method is called on the ActiveX object, passing the file path as an argument. This will attempt to write data (likely error details) to the file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit was tested on Windows XP Professional SP2 with Internet Explorer 6.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.8/10, with an exploitability subscore of 8.6/10, indicating a moderately severe and easily exploitable issue.
- The exploit is marked as 'remote' and requiring medium attack complexity.

This detailed explanation should provide a thorough understanding of the vulnerability described by CVE-2008-4584.
