Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-4666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `webboard.php` file of Ultimate WebBoard version 3.00.
*   The vulnerable code constructs a SQL query using unsanitized user input from the `Category` parameter:
    ```php
    $sql="select * from board_data where Category='$Category' order by No DESC";
    ```
* The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `Category` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize user-supplied input before incorporating it into a SQL query. This enables SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, enabling them to read, modify, or delete data, potentially leading to a full compromise of the application and the underlying system. In the provided example, the attacker is able to extract database usernames and passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request targeting `webboard.php` and manipulating the `Category` parameter, as demonstrated in the provided Proof of Concept (PoC).
   ```
   http://[Target]/[webboard]/webboard.php?Category=[Category'name][SQL Injection]
   ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, simply by sending a malicious request to the web application.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication or special privileges on the system, they just need network access to the vulnerable application.
*  **Magic Quotes OFF:** The attacker needs magic quotes to be turned off on the server.

**Additional Information:**
*   The exploit requires magic quotes to be turned off.
*   The provided PoC uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract user and password data from the `mysql.user` table.
