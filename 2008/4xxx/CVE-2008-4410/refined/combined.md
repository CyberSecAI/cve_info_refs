1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This patch updates the openSUSE 11.0 kernel to the 2.6.25.18 stable
release.
It also includes bugfixes and security fixes:
CVE-2008-4410: The vmi\_write\_ldt\_entry function in
arch/x86/kernel/vmi\_32.c in the Virtual Machine Interface (VMI) in the
Linux kernel 2.6.26.5 invokes write\_idt\_entry where write\_ldt\_entry
was intended, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
(persistent application failure) via crafted function calls, related
to the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) experiencing improper LDT
selector state.
CVE-2008-4618: Fixed a kernel panic in SCTP while process protocol
violation parameter.
CVE-2008-3528: The ext[234] filesystem code fails to properly handle
corrupted data structures. With a mounted filesystem image or partition
that have corrupted dir->i\_size and dir->i\_blocks, a user performing
either a read or write operation on the mounted image or partition
can lead to a possible denial of service by spamming the logfile.
CVE-2008-3526: Integer overflow in the sctp\_setsockopt\_auth\_key
function in net/sctp/socket.c in the Stream Control Transmission
Protocol (sctp) implementation in the Linux kernel allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted sca\_keylength field associated
with the SCTP\_AUTH\_KEY option.
CVE-2008-3525: Added missing capability checks in sbni\_ioctl().
CVE-2008-4576: SCTP in Linux kernel before 2.6.25.18 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (OOPS) via an INIT-ACK
that states the peer does not support AUTH, which causes the
sctp\_process\_init function to clean up active transports and triggers
the OOPS when the T1-Init timer expires.
CVE-2008-4445: The sctp\_auth\_ep\_set\_hmacs function in net/sctp/auth.c
in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (sctp) implementation
in the Linux kernel before 2.6.26.4, when the SCTP-AUTH extension
is enabled, does not verify that the identifier index is within the
bounds established by SCTP\_AUTH\_HMAC\_ID\_MAX, which allows local users
to obtain sensitive information via a crafted SCTP\_HMAC\_IDENT IOCTL
request involving the sctp\_getsockopt function.
CVE-2008-3792: net/sctp/socket.c in the Stream Control Transmission
Protocol (sctp) implementation in the Linux kernel 2.6.26.3 does not
verify that the SCTP-AUTH extension is enabled before proceeding
with SCTP-AUTH API functions, which allows attackers to cause
a denial of service (panic) via vectors that result in calls to
(1) sctp\_setsockopt\_auth\_chunk, (2) sctp\_setsockopt\_hmac\_ident,
(3) sctp\_setsockopt\_auth\_key, (4) sctp\_setsockopt\_active\_key,
(5) sctp\_setsockopt\_del\_key, (6) sctp\_getsockopt\_maxburst, (7)
sctp\_getsockopt\_active\_key, (8) sctp\_getsockopt\_peer\_auth\_chunks, or
(9) sctp\_getsockopt\_local\_auth\_chunks.
CVE-2008-4113: The sctp\_getsockopt\_hmac\_ident function in
net/sctp/socket.c in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (sctp)
implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.26.4, when the SCTP-AUTH
extension is enabled, relies on an untrusted length value to limit
copying of data from kernel memory, which allows local users to
obtain sensitive information via a crafted SCTP\_HMAC\_IDENT IOCTL
request involving the sctp\_getsockopt function.
CVE-2008-3911: The proc\_do\_xprt function in net/sunrpc/sysctl.c in
the Linux kernel 2.6.26.3 does not check the length of a certain
buffer obtained from user space, which allows local users to overflow
a stack-based buffer and have unspecified other impact via a crafted
read system call for the /proc/sys/sunrpc/transports file.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot your machine after installing the kernel.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Message-ID: <48E5DE19.8090606@redhat.com>
Date: Fri, 03 Oct 2008 16:55:53 +0800
From: Eugene Teo <eteo@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE request: kernel: x86: Fix broken LDT access in VMI

This was committed in upstream kernel recently.

"[PATCH] x86: Fix broken LDT access in VMI

After investigating a JRE failure, I found this bug was introduced a
long time ago, and had already managed to survive another bugfix which
occurred on the same line.  The result is a total failure of the JRE due
to LDT selectors not working properly.

This one took a long time to rear up because LDT usage is not very
common, but the bug is quite serious.  It got introduced along with
another bug, already fixed, by 75b8bb3e56ca09a467fbbe5229bc68627f7445be"

This requires a CVE name. In a guest, an unprivileged user can trash the
box's interrupts by calling vmi_write_ldt_entry(), which in turn, writes
to idt_entry (interrupt) instead of ldt_entry (local). Take note that
sys_modify_ldt() does not check for privileges.

Upstream commit: de59985e3a623d4d5d6207f1777398ca0606ab1c
Introduced by: 75b8bb3e56ca09a467fbbe5229bc68627f7445be

Thanks, Eugene
