Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4785

**Vulnerability Description:**
The vulnerability is a remote SQL injection flaw found in the `alternate_profiles` plugin for the e107 content management system. Specifically, the `newuser.php` script is vulnerable through the `id` parameter.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `id` parameter within the `newuser.php` script before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact:** Partial. An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database. The provided exploit demonstrates how to extract usernames and passwords from the `e107_user` table.
- **Integrity Impact:** Partial.  An attacker could modify database entries, potentially altering website content, user profiles, or other critical data.
- **Availability Impact:** Partial. While not directly shown, SQL injection could potentially lead to denial of service by manipulating queries to cause database errors or overload the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack Vector:** The attack is performed remotely via a crafted URL.
- **Attack Complexity:** Low. The attack is relatively simple to perform by manipulating the `id` parameter within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires no authentication and can exploit the vulnerability over the network by sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable Plugin: `alternate_profiles`
- Vulnerable Script: `newuser.php`
- Vulnerable Parameter: `id`
- Example Exploit:
  ```
  http://localhost/e107_plugins/alternate_profiles/newuser.php?id=-9999+union+all+select+1,concat(user_name,char(58),user_password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31+from+e107_user/*
  ```
  This exploit uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to retrieve the `user_name` and `user_password` from the `e107_user` table. The `concat` function joins these values with a colon.

**Additional Information:**
- CVSS Score: 7.5/10 (High)
- Exploitability Subscore: 10/10
- Impact Subscore: 6.4/10
- Dork: `inurl:"/alternate_profiles/"` (Used to find vulnerable installations through search engines).
- Vulnerable application is e107.
