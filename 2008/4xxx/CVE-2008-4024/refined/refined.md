      "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Word handles specially crafted Word files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Word file with a malformed record. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when a user opens a specially crafted Word file, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.",
       "weaknesses": [
          "Memory corruption due to improper handling of malformed records in Word files."

      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-on user, potentially gaining complete control of the system.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by opening a specially crafted Word file, either as an email attachment or from a malicious website.",
