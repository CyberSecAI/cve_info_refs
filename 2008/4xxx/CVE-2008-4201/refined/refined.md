    "ID": "CVE-2008-4201",
    "content": "The provided content details a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `decodeMP4file` function of the `faad2` library's frontend, specifically in `main.c`. This vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted MPEG-4 (MP4) file. The root cause of the vulnerability lies in an incorrect calculation of the `sample_count` variable leading to a heap buffer overflow.\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**\n*   Heap-based buffer overflow in `frontend/main.c`'s `decodeMP4file` function.\n*   Incorrect calculation of `sample_count`.\n\n**Impact:**\n*   Denial of service (crash).\n*   Potential for arbitrary code execution.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   Opening a specially crafted MPEG-4 (MP4) file in an application that uses `faad2`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   Ability to create a malicious MP4 file.\n*   User interaction required to open the crafted file with a vulnerable application."
