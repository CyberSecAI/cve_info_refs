Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-4528

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `notes.php` script. Specifically, the code directly uses user-supplied input from the `id` GET parameter to construct a file path that is then included via a `require` statement, which results in a Local File Inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input before using it to construct a file path. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's file system by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, database credentials, or source code.
- **Potential Code Execution:** While the provided information does not specifically mention it, inclusion of files containing executable code could potentially lead to remote code execution if the server processes the included file in an inappropriate way. This would depend on the server configuration and the type of included files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the `notes.php` script, setting the `mode` parameter to "edit" and the `id` parameter to a path that points to a file the attacker wishes to read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They do not need prior authentication or to be on the same network as the server.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet highlights the following:

```php
107: if (isset($_GET["mode"]))
	 {
	  	if ($_GET["mode"]=="edit")
		{
		 if (isset($_GET['id']))
		 {
		  	$notefile = $_GET['id'];
			if ($notefile == "new")
			{
			 $title = "";
			 $notes = "";
			}
			else
			{
			 $temp = "notes/" . $notefile;
			 require($temp);
123:			}
x:  }}}
```

This code directly concatenates the user-supplied `id` parameter to the string "notes/" and uses the resulting string as the file to be included. There is no sanitization or validation of the `id` parameter.

**Example Exploit:**
The provided example shows how an attacker could use this vulnerability to read the `/etc/passwd` file:

```
http://www.localhost.com/notes.php?mode=edit&id=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```
This will make the server attempt to include the `/etc/passwd` file, potentially revealing sensitive information about users on the server.
