  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is triggered when a Windows Mobile 6.0 device attempts to establish a connection with a Bluetooth device presenting an excessively long name. The vulnerability is not in the long string name itself but the fact that when the device tries to establish the connection for the first time with the said long name.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow when handling a long device name during Bluetooth connection establishment.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote denial of service (device reboot)",
  "Attack vectors": "Bluetooth connection establishment process. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability in two ways: by forcing the target device to connect to a Bluetooth device with a crafted long name, or by advertising a Bluetooth device with a long name and waiting for the target device to scan and attempt a connection.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the target device. They need the ability to advertise a Bluetooth device or connect to the target via bluetooth. They need to be able to send a long string as the bluetooth device name."
