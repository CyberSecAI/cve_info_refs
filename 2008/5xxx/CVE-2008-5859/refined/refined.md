Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5859:

**Summary:**

The provided content indicates that CVE-2008-5859 relates to multiple vulnerabilities in Constructr CMS version 3.02.5 and earlier. This includes directory traversal, source disclosure, and arbitrary file creation. Additionally, SQL injection vulnerabilities are also present.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   **Directory Traversal:** Improper handling of file paths in `template.php` allows for accessing files outside of the intended directory.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Unsanitized user input in the `show_page` parameter of the main application allows for arbitrary SQL queries.
    *  **General:**  The application is vulnerable due to magic_quotes_gpc being off and register_globals being on.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Directory Traversal:** Allows an attacker to read arbitrary files.
    *   **Source Disclosure:**  Exposing sensitive configuration files (e.g., `config/config.inc.php`).
    *  **Arbitrary File Creation:**  Vulnerability in template.php
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or complete database takeover.  The extracted information indicates the 'hash' is actually a password in plain text.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive system files, including database configuration files, potentially revealing database credentials.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, the combination of directory traversal, source disclosure and arbitrary file creation could lead to arbitrary code execution by creating a malicious file and including it.
    *   **Data Breach:** SQL injection can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive information stored in the database.
    *  **Complete System Takeover (Potential):**  The combination of these vulnerabilities could lead to full system compromise.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Directory Traversal:** By manipulating the `edit_file` parameter in the `template.php` script: `http://site/constructr/backend/template.php?edit_file=`.
    *   **SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `show_page` parameter: `http://site/constructr/?show_page=`.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Constructr CMS application.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry mentions that the password hashes are not really encrypted, making account takeover easier.
* The advisory confirms that the "Author notified: Dec 12" and the "Public Disclosure: Dec 19". This means the vulnerability was publicly disclosed after a week.
*   The software is vulnerable when `magic_quotes_gpc` is Off and `register_globals` is On, which implies outdated configurations.
*   Multiple CVEs are referenced in this exploit entry ([2008-5860](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-5860), [2008-5859](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-5859), [2008-5847](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-5847)), all related to Constructr CMS vulnerabilities.
