Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5401

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the tooltip processing code of Cerulean Studios Trillian. When the application creates a tooltip for an image, it generates an XML tag that includes a property containing the filename. The filename data is directly copied into a stack-based buffer without any length checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The lack of length validation when copying the filename into the buffer leads to a buffer overflow if the filename is excessively long.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system with the privileges of the Trillian client.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring any authentication.
- Malicious image tooltip: An attacker could craft a malicious image containing a long filename that when displayed triggers the overflow within the tooltip processing code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker with the ability to send crafted messages that could cause the application to display an image tooltip with a long filename. No authentication is needed.

**Additional details:**
- The vendor has released an update to correct this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability via filter ID '6622'.
