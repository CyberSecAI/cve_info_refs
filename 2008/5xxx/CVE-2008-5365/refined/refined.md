  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting SQL queries through the vulnerable parameter. While this is a blind SQL injection, information can still be extracted through conditional responses from the server.",
   "Attack vectors": [
    "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the VoteHistory.asp page, manipulating the AccountID parameter with SQL injection payloads"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. The vulnerability is present in the web application."
