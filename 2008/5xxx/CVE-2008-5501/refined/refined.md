{
  "CVE-2008-5501": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is caused by an error in how the browser handles the interaction between position:inherit, CSS counters, and the ::first-line pseudo-element, leading to incorrect style context reparenting.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause is improper handling of style context reparenting when the position property is set to inherit, in conjunction with CSS counters and the ::first-line pseudo-element. The ReParentStyleContext operation assumes that no restyling will be needed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect style context reparenting",
       "Insufficient checks during style context changes",
      "Assumption that ReParentStyleContext will not require restyling"
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability can lead to assertions failing, browser crashes, and potentially memory corruption, which could be exploited to run arbitrary code. Resizing the browser window after triggering the vulnerability can reliably lead to a crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious HTML document that uses the vulnerable combination of CSS properties and pseudo-elements. Opening this document in a vulnerable browser will trigger the flaw.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to serve a malicious web page to a user. No specific user interaction is required beyond the user visiting the page. The user must be using a vulnerable version of the browser."
  },
  "CVE-2008-5502": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient buffer checks in the js_DeflateString function within the JavaScript engine, which leads to memory corruption.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is that the GetXMLEntity function assumes that FastAppendChar is infallible and continues to read characters from the buffer even after FastAppendChar fails due to buffer overflow. Specifically, during E4X parsing, an attempt to read beyond the buffer occurs.",
     "Weaknesses": [
       "Insufficient bounds checking",
       "Improper handling of buffer overflow",
       "Assumption of infallibility in FastAppendChar"
     ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the browser (segmentation fault) due to memory corruption. In the debug shell, an assertion failure 'nbytes != 0' is triggered.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript code, specifically through E4X, with a very long string, such that when parsed, it overflows the internal string buffer in GetXMLEntity function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to execute malicious JavaScript code in the victimâ€™s browser, for example, via a website. User interaction is limited to visiting the malicious webpage."
