{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the 'cookie_language' parameter, allowing for local file inclusion (LFI). Additionally, the script allows arbitrary file uploads, which can be used in conjunction with the LFI to execute arbitrary code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Arbitrary File Upload",
      "Improper input validation",
       "Insufficient access restrictions on scripts"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading a malicious file (e.g., a PHP file with malicious code), and then including it using the LFI vulnerability. This can lead to complete compromise of the web server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to upload a malicious file",
      "HTTP GET request with a crafted cookie to trigger LFI",
      "Manipulation of the 'cookie_language' parameter"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They must also be able to upload files and manipulate cookie parameters. No authentication is required to perform the attack.",
        "additional_information": "The exploit also uses a vulnerability in preferences.php?action=setcookie, to set the cookie which stores the LFI path. This is used together with the LFI vulnerability found in print.php."
