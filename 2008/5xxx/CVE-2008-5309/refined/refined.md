Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5309

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `ad_id` parameter of the `re_send_email` module in the Netartmedia Real Estate Portal version 1.2. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `ad_id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries.
-  The provided exploit allows an attacker to extract usernames and passwords from the `websiteadmin_admin_users` table, potentially granting administrative access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php?mod=re_send_email` with a malicious `ad_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No special privileges or internal network access are required.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to inject malicious SQL code:
```
http://www.site.com/index.php?mod=re_send_email&ad_id=-7+union+select+concat(username,0x3e,password),2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23+from+websiteadmin_admin_users--
```
- This code leverages a negative number and a `UNION SELECT` statement to bypass the application's normal SQL query, and then selects user information using `concat` and 0x3e which is a greater-than symbol.
- The `--` at the end of the exploit is used to comment out the rest of the original SQL query to prevent errors.
