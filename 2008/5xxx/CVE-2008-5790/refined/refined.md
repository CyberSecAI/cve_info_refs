{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Joomla! Recly!Competitions component allows for remote file inclusion due to the insecure use of the `mosConfig_absolute_path` variable in several PHP files. This variable is used in `require_once` statements to include other PHP files, but the value of this variable is taken directly from user input without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing them to gain control over the server and the Joomla application. This could lead to data theft, defacement of the website, or further attacks on other systems.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable PHP files within the `com_competitions` component. The attacker injects a malicious URL into the `GLOBALS[mosConfig_absolute_path]` or `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter, which will then be included by the `require_once` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! site. They do not need any prior authentication or privileges. The attacker also needs access to a publicly available or controllable web server hosting the malicious files to include."
