```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses user-supplied input from the 'page' and 'admin' GET parameters to include files without proper sanitization. Specifically, the application uses `file_exists()` to check file existence, and then uses `require()` to include the files, which is vulnerable if an attacker injects a path traversal payload with null byte.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Local File Inclusion (LFI), Path Traversal, Improper Input Validation
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can read arbitrary local files on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure or other attacks depending on the content of the files and capabilities of the server/interpreter.
- Attack vectors: HTTP GET requests with malicious `page` or `admin` parameters.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.
