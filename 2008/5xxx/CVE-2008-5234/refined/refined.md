- Vulnerability: Heap buffer overflow in xine-lib
- Affected component: demux_real.c
- Impact: Possible Remote Code Execution
- Root cause: Vulnerability lies within `real_parse_audio_specific_data()` function where a user-supplied height (codec_data_length) is used as the divisor when calculating frame_size. This may result in a divide by zero. Also, missing check for successful frame_buffer allocation which may result in NULL dereferences later. If `sps` is 0 and `w` and `h` are both 65535, then the frame_size will overflow resulting in an underallocation. It is also possible to incorrectly calculate the frame_size if sps is non-zero.
- Attack vector: By providing a specially crafted real audio file to xine.
- Details: `real_parse_audio_specific_data()` uses a user-supplied height (codec_data_length) as the divisor when calculating frame_size. It may be zero, resulting in a divide by zero. In addition, there is no check for successful frame_buffer allocation which may result in NULL dereferences later. In addition to a divide by zero, if sps is 0 and w and h are both 65535 (they are read as 16-bit ints), then the frame_size will overflow resulting in an underallocation. If sps is non-zero, it is also possible to incorrectly calculate the frame_size. It appears that this is exploitable. In `demux_real_send_chunk()`, if the audio type is BUF_AUDIO_COOK, ..._ATRK, ..._28_8, or ..._SIPRO, the frame buffer will be populated as the width and height are traversed. This allows for a direct overflow which is somewhat controllable. In particular, the easiest way to limit the total length is to truncate the source data after overflowing the buffer sufficiently. However, there are other tweaks which allow fine grain control. COOK and ATRK both use 'sps' to control the increment read while SIPRO uses the width (w), and 28_8 uses the 'cfs' -- all of these values user-supplied.
