Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5864:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection in the `id` parameter of the `com_tophotelmodule` Joomla component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application does not directly reveal the output of SQL queries, but an attacker can infer information by observing the application's response to crafted inputs. The `id` parameter in the URL is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, personal data, and other application data.
- Integrity impact: An attacker might be able to modify data in the database.
- Availability impact: An attacker might be able to disrupt application operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests are used to access the vulnerable component. The `id` parameter within the URL is manipulated to inject SQL queries.
- The vulnerable URL structure is: `http://demo.joomlahbs.com/p2/index.php?option=com_tophotelmodule&task=showhoteldetails&id=[SQL-vulnerability]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to construct appropriate payloads.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided exploit examples demonstrate the use of `substring` and `@@version` to probe the database version, indicating a blind SQL injection scenario.
- The component version `1.0.0` is vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is present in the `com_tophotelmodule` component of Joomla.
- The exploit examples use the `demo.joomlahbs.com` as the target server.
