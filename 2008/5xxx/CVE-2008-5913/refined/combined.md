## Details

USN-930-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox and Xulrunner. This update

provides updated packages for use with Firefox 3.6 and Xulrunner 1.9.2 on

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

Original advisory details:

If was discovered that Firefox could be made to access freed memory. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-1121](/security/CVE-2010-1121))

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1200](/security/CVE-2010-1200), [CVE-2010-1201](/security/CVE-2010-1201),

[CVE-2010-1202](/security/CVE-2010-1202), [CVE-2010-1203](/security/CVE-2010-1203))

A flaw was discovered in the way plugin instances interacted. An attacker

could potentially exploit this and use one plugin to access freed memory from a

second plugin to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1198](/security/CVE-2010-1198))

An integer overflow was discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into

viewing a malicious site, an attacker could overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1196](/security/CVE-2010-1196))

Martin Barbella discovered an integer overflow in an XSLT node sorting

routine. An attacker could exploit this to overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1199](/security/CVE-2010-1199))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the focus behavior of Firefox could be

subverted. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote

attacker could use this to capture keystrokes. ([CVE-2010-1125](/security/CVE-2010-1125))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the 'Content-Disposition: attachment'

HTTP header was ignored when 'Content-Type: multipart' was also present.

Under certain circumstances, this could potentially lead to cross-site

scripting attacks. ([CVE-2010-1197](/security/CVE-2010-1197))

Amit Klein discovered that Firefox did not seed its random number generator

often enough. An attacker could exploit this to identify and track users

across different web sites. ([CVE-2008-5913](/security/CVE-2008-5913))

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

firefox security, bug fix, and enhancement update (RHSA-2010-0500)

Original Release Date: June 25, 2010

Last Revised: July 7, 2011

Number: ASA-2010-165

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-1121](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1121.html), [CVE-2010-1200](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1200.html), [CVE-2010-1202](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1202.html) and [CVE-2010-1203](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1203.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way browser plug-ins interact. It was possible for
a plug-in to reference the freed memory from a different plug-in, resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1198](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1198.html) to this issue.

Several integer overflow flaws were found in the processing of malformed
web content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-1196](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1196.html) and [CVE-2010-1199](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1199.html) to these issues.

A focus stealing flaw was found in the way Firefox handled focus changes. A
malicious website could use this flaw to steal sensitive data from a user,
such as usernames and passwords. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1125](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1125.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the "Content-Disposition:
attachment" HTTP header when the "Content-Type: multipart" HTTP header was
also present. A website that allows arbitrary uploads and relies on the
"Content-Disposition: attachment" HTTP header to prevent content from being
displayed inline, could be used by an attacker to serve malicious content
to users. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1197](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1197.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the Firefox Math.random() function. This function could
be used to identify a browsing session and track a user across different
websites. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-5913](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2008-5913.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the Firefox XML document loading security checks.
Certain security checks were not being called when an XML document was
loaded. This could possibly be leveraged later by an attacker to load
certain resources that violate the security policies of the browser or its
add-ons. Note that this issue cannot be exploited by only loading an XML
document. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-0182](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-0182.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0500.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using RHEL4 with the affected version of firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | IALX 2.0 including 2.0 SP1 and 2.0 SP2 | Low | See recommended actions below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya Message Networking | MN 5.2.2 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to Message Networking 5.2.3 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

   Global intelligence

IBM Trusteer analyzes devices on several levels. Device attributes are reviewed and checked for spoofing and abnormalities. Devices are then checked for malware before being scanned for other cybercriminal tools
such as emulators, screen overlays and remote access tools.

Network information is crucial in determining the risk associated with a potential fraudulent activity. Trusteer checks for the location, carrier or hosting service while also detecting whether a VPN is being used or a call is in progress on the device because these are common social engineering techniques.

Behavior of a user can be assessed by looking at behavioral biometrics such as swipes, keystrokes, mouse movements, session length and more. These can be compared to previous user sessions and flagged if discrepancies are detected.

Data relating to the user’s accounts can be key in determining whether a cybercriminal is performing fraudulent activities. Transactional data such as amounts, targeted accounts and transactional types alongside account opening data can be analyzed and used to prevent funneling of funds to criminals.

IBM Trusteer employs a team of world-class threat experts that constantly monitor the dark web to identify emerging threats and devise ways to detect them. In addition, they tap into a global intelligence network of millions of devices across 190 countries by using a unique and persistent fingerprint for every device.

IBM Trusteer analyzes devices on several levels. Device attributes are reviewed and checked for spoofing and abnormalities. Devices are then checked for malware before being scanned for other cybercriminal tools
such as emulators, screen overlays and remote access tools.

Minimize to nav

Another year, another form of phishing. This one, I have to admit, is pretty good in terms of potentially fooling a user. Unlike most phishing attack vectors, it doesn't rely on the victim being ignorant and/or moronic. The new technique has been dubbed "in-session" phishing and it stays out of your e-mail altogether.

Security researchers with Trusteer have published a [report](http://www.trusteer.com/files/In-session-phishing-advisory-2.pdf) (PDF) on this new type of phishing along with a suitably vague description of how the attack works. As its name implies, in-session phishing requires that the victim first log into a secure website; Trusteer uses an online bank site as one example of a tasty target.

Here's how the attack works: A user *legitimately* logs into his bank, authenticates, and then does whatever he logged in to do. Once finished, he opens another browser tab (or browser window) and leaves the bank website open. Shortly thereafter, he encounters a website that has been injected with the malicious code in question. Once run, the malware creates a pop-up, supposedly from the bank or secure site that's still open in another tab or window. The "authentic" pop-up prompts the user to enter his login credentials again in order to resume the session. Trusteer notes that the attack could be used to present different types of lures including online surveys or mini-flash games (punch the Yeti, enter your personal data, and win a free Llama!).

In order for the attack to function, Trusteer states that two conditions must be met. First, a website must be compromised and infected—the higher traffic the better, obviously. Secondly, the downloaded malware must be able to identify whether or not the unknowing carrier is logged into a relevant website. Trusteer does not state how long the window of opportunity is open for this particular attack to execute, but does note that the malware infection is temporary.

Trusteer explains how the bug works. It is present in the JavaScript engine used by popular browsers like IE, Firefox, and Safari, as well as Chrome, and allows a site to determine whether a user is also logged into another site.

> The source of the vulnerability is a specific JavaScript function. When this function is called it leaves a temporary footprint on the computer and any other website can identify this footprint. Websites that use this function in a certain way are traceable. Many websites, including financial institutions, online retailers, social networking websites, gaming, and gambling websites use this function and can be traced.

The researchers recommend that users and companies deploy appropriate web security tools (which the company happens to sell), immediately log out of any secure sites once you've finished your tasks (good advice), and to be extremely wary of pop-ups that randomly drop in if you haven't clicked anything.

The JavaScript vulnerability that Trusteer has discovered obviously needs patching, but in-session phishing doesn't appear to be a major threat. In order to function successfully, the malware requires that a user have simultaneous browser windows open to both a login/secure site and an infected site, and that the secure site is on the malware's pregenerated list of targets. There are some rather simple ways for banks and other targeted institutions to fight back; options include rapid disconnects if a user becomes idle and prominent notifications of the company's login policy.

Many companies (Blizzard and AOL come to mind) prominently and repeatedly inform customers that neither the company nor its representatives will ever, ever, ask a user to disclose their password. A similar warning against in-session phishing might state that the company will never ask users to log in via a pop-up or any third-party service. Between currently available solutions and inevitable patches, I think in-session phishing is going to find its nets mostly empty.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 3.5.10, fixing various bugs
and security issues.
MFSA 2010-33 / CVE-2008-5913:
Security researcher Amit Klein reported that it was possible to reverse
engineer the value used to seed Math.random(). Since the pseudo-random
number generator was only seeded once per browsing session, this seed
value could be used as a unique token to identify and track users
across different web sites.
MFSA 2010-32 / CVE-2010-1197:
Security researcher Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive reported that
the Content-Disposition: attachment HTTP header was ignored when
Content-Type: multipart was also present. This issue could potentially
lead to XSS problems in sites that allow users to upload arbitrary
files and specify a Content-Type but rely on Content-Disposition:
attachment to prevent the content from being displayed inline.
MFSA 2010-31 / CVE-2010-1125:
Google security researcher Michal Zalewski reported that focus()
could be used to change a user's cursor focus while they are
typing, potentially directing their keyboard input to an unintended
location. This behavior was also present across origins when content
from one domain was embedded within another via an IFRAME. A malicious
web page could use this behavior to steal keystrokes from a victim
while they were typing sensitive information such as a password.
MFSA 2010-30 / CVE-2010-1199:
Security researcher Martin Barbella reported via TippingPoint's Zero
Day Initiative that an XSLT node sorting routine contained an integer
overflow vulnerability. In cases where one of the nodes to be sorted
contained a very large text value, the integer used to allocate a
memory buffer to store its value would overflow, resulting in too small
a buffer being created. An attacker could use this vulnerability to
write data past the end of the buffer, causing the browser to crash
and potentially running arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-29 / CVE-2010-1196:
Security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity reported that the routine
for setting the text value for certain types of DOM nodes contained an
integer overflow vulnerability. When a very long string was passed to
this routine, the integer value used in creating a new memory buffer
to hold the string would overflow, resulting in too small a buffer
being allocated. An attacker could use this vulnerability to write
data past the end of the buffer, causing a crash and potentially
running arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-28 / CVE-2010-1198:
Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported that two plugin instances
could interact in a way in which one plugin gets a reference to an
object owned by a second plugin and continues to hold that reference
after the second plugin is unloaded and its object is destroyed. In
these cases, the first plugin would contain a pointer to freed memory
which, if accessed, could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary
code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-27 / CVE-2010-0183:
Security researcher wushi of team509 reported that the frame
construction process for certain types of menus could result in a menu
containing a pointer to a previously freed menu item. During the cycle
collection process, this freed item could be accessed, resulting in the
execution of a section of code potentially controlled by an attacker.
MFSA 2010-26 / CVE-2010-1200 / CVE-2010-1201 / CVE-2010-1202 / CVE-2010-1203:
Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the
browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some
of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some
of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
MFSA 2010-25 / CVE-2010-1121:
A memory corruption flaw leading to code execution was reported by
security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity during the 2010 Pwn2Own
contest sponsored by TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative. By moving
DOM nodes between documents Nils found a case where the moved node
incorrectly retained its old scope. If garbage collection could
be triggered at the right time then Firefox would later use this
freed object. The contest winning exploit only affects Firefox 3.6
and not earlier versions. Updated (June 22, 2010): Firefox 3.5,
SeaMonkey 2.0, and Thunderbird 3.0 based on earlier versions of the
browser engine were patched just in case there is an alternate way
of triggering the underlying flaw.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Mozilla Firefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-930-1: Firefox and Xulrunner vulnerabilities

29 June 2010

Firefox could be made to run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file or website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Safe and easy web browser from Mozilla
* [firefox-3.0](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.0) - Safe and easy web browser from Mozilla
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9.2) - XUL + XPCOM application runner

## Details

If was discovered that Firefox could be made to access freed memory. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-1121](/security/CVE-2010-1121))

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1200](/security/CVE-2010-1200), [CVE-2010-1201](/security/CVE-2010-1201),

[CVE-2010-1202](/security/CVE-2010-1202), [CVE-2010-1203](/security/CVE-2010-1203))

A flaw was discovered in the way plugin instances interacted. An attacker

could potentially exploit this and use one plugin to access freed memory from a

second plugin to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1198](/security/CVE-2010-1198))

An integer overflow was discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into

viewing a malicious site, an attacker could overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1196](/security/CVE-2010-1196))

Martin Barbella discovered an integer overflow in an XSLT node sorting

routine. An attacker could exploit this to overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1199](/security/CVE-2010-1199))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the focus behavior of Firefox could be

subverted. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote

attacker could use this to capture keystrokes. ([CVE-2010-1125](/security/CVE-2010-1125))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the 'Content-Disposition: attachment'

HTTP header was ignored when 'Content-Type: multipart' was also present.

Under certain circumstances, this could potentially lead to cross-site

scripting attacks. ([CVE-2010-1197](/security/CVE-2010-1197))

Amit Klein discovered that Firefox did not seed its random number generator

often enough. An attacker could exploit this to identify and track users

across different web sites. ([CVE-2008-5913](/security/CVE-2008-5913))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox-3.0)
  -
  [3.6.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox-3.0/3.6.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1)
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2)
  -
  [1.9.2.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2/1.9.2.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [abrowser](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [3.6.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/3.6.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)
* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [3.6.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/3.6.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2)
  -
  [1.9.2.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2/1.9.2.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

Mozilla has changed the support model for Firefox and they no longer

support version 3.0 of the browser. As a result, Ubuntu is providing an

upgrade to Firefox 3.6 for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS users, which is the most current

stable release of Firefox supported by Mozilla. When upgrading, users

should be aware of the following:

* Firefox 3.6 does not support version 5 of the Sun Java plugin. Please use

  icedtea-java7-plugin or sun-java6-plugin instead.
* After upgrading to Firefox 3.6.6, users may be prompted to upgrade 3rd

  party Add-Ons. In some cases, an Add-On will not be compatible with

  Firefox 3.6.6 and have no update available. In these cases, Firefox will

  notify the user that it is disabling the Add-On.
* Upgrades to Ubuntu 8.10 from Ubuntu 8.04 LTS may break the browser.

  Ubuntu 8.10 is no longer officially supported and users are required to

  upgrade to 9.04 to receive active security support and a functional browser.
* Font configuration cannot be controlled via Gnome settings. This is a

  known issue being tracked in <https://launchpad.net/bugs/559149> and will

  be fixed in a later update.
* helix-player is not currently supported in Firefox 3.6. This is a known

  issue and may be fixed in a future update.
* RealAudio via the totem plugin is no longer supported in Firefox 3.6 in

  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. Affected users navigating to Real content will be

  prompted to install optional community supported packages.
* In Ubuntu 8.04 LTS the xine plugin is non-functional. After upgrading to

  Firefox 3.6, the plugin may cause the browser to crash, while in Firefox

  3.0 it would be silently ignored. Users are advised to uninstall

  xine-plugin and/or gxineplugin.
* Plugins using external helpers (such as Totem) may not close when using

  the Epiphany browser. This is a known issue being tracked in

  <https://launchpad.net/bugs/599796> and will be fixed in a later update.

  This issue only affects Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox and any

applications that use Xulrunner to effect the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Attached file
[reporter's paper (pdf)](attachment.cgi?id=456463)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=456463&action=edit)

Amit Klein of Trusteer reports that our previous fixes for [bug 464071](/show_bug.cgi?id=464071 "RESOLVED FIXED - User tracking via Math.random output and multipart/form-data boundary string") and [bug 475585](/show_bug.cgi?id=475585 "RESOLVED FIXED - Re-seed Math.random() for each window/frame/context") were insufficient and sends the attached paper.
He would like to know "within one (1) week from today, whether you confirm and acknowledge the technical nature of the vulnerabilities described in the attachment. Of course, I'm available for questions/discussions/suggestions at any time. If you need an extension, please let me know in advance."
He may be disclosing this issue in the future at "a security conference, in which case I would ask you to defer your own disclosure to a date as close to the conference as possible."
Abstract
--------
While Mozilla attempted to address the issues of cross domain information leakage (through Math.random) in Firefox 3.6.4 (and above), Firefox 3.5.10 and Firefox 4.0 (alpha and beta), there is still a security vulnerability in the way the isolation is implemented, which enables cross domain leakage. In fact, it may make it easier to attack Firefox in some cases, compared to previous versions.
Additionally, a concerned is raised on the entropy provided in the seed to the Math.random PRNG, which may enable more powerful attacks.

Gah. The patch in [bug 475585](/show_bug.cgi?id=475585 "RESOLVED FIXED - Re-seed Math.random() for each window/frame/context") could really have used a DOM reviewer...
Shouldn't we reseed the rng at the point where we clear the outer window scope during page navigation?

Yes, we should re-seed. And I also have very serious doubts about the severity of this attack. Math.random is a terrible PRNG, its completely underspecified and doesn't give you any guarantees what kind of randomness or entropy you get out of it. It shouldn't be used for anything but casual random number generation in the first place.

bz, we currently have the rng state in cx, but really it should be in the scope actually (global object). I can clear the cx the clear scope request comes in on, but thats conceptually not guaranteed to be the right one (its in our embedding I am pretty sure though).

> but really it should be in the scope actually
Conceptually, yes.
If there is api to reseed the rng, we could just call that in the DOM code...

Attached is a patch that re-seeds when the scope is cleared. Should we seed from /dev/random? I initialize libc's prng and seed with that, but stacking prngs is usually a bad idea.Assignee: general → gal

Please make this compile on Windows. As discussed, the seeding is a side-show; might not be worth worrying about.

After discussion today, we agreed that it would be nice if each context got its own Math.random() seed, to reduce the risk of things like cross-site tracking based on randomness seed.

The attached patch makes the RNG context-local and seeds it when the context is created. In addition to time the context pointer and its successor pointer are used for the seed, in case we bring up a number of contexts at the same time.

dmandelin suggested seeding with the context pointer. dolske suggested making sure we don't just seed with one pointer.

For the first context, |cx == cx->link.next| as I understand it, so the seed is thus |timeSecs ^ (a ^ a)|, which collapses to |(timeSecs ^ 0) == timeSecs|. The first context in the browser is apparently for the JS component loader, so it's going to be long-lived. If we're really worried about pages snooping on each other in this way, we should be worried about pages snooping on components which might possibly take user-affected inputs (foxyproxy would be one such component) and which use Math.random() (fewer still, but not out of the question). The first context even runs privileged code, making it more interesting to attack. I suggest making the last piece of this int64(JS\_LIKELY(cx->link.next != cx) ? cx->link.next : 0) as a precaution in this case so we'll actually do a small amount of fudging to an otherwise time-based seed in that case.

Although, I suppose in that case the reverse-engineer-the-JSContext\* attack is then feasible again; that probably doesn't matter that much, but if it does we could always use |cx->runtime| instead.
We really need to decide on a cryptographically-secure random number generation API, propose it for ES6, and implement it. This half-concern, half-you're-doing-it-wrong attitude we have is just making more and more work for us.

No, there's a header, rt->contextList.

No one is going to use a new API (especially one that can't be emulated if not supplied by older browsers) for years.
Anyway [bug 322529](/show_bug.cgi?id=322529 "RESOLVED FIXED - Upgrade Math.random() to the better XorShift128+ algorithm") proposes to strengthen Math.random() sufficiently. Then the only fear is stupid ND benchmarketing noticing the regression.

The only nit I might add is that cx ^ cx->link.next won't give you many bits if they're close to each other.

[bug 511328](/show_bug.cgi?id=511328 "RESOLVED FIXED - TM: make Math.random threadlocal") took over a large part of this (making rngSeed thread local). Will land the rest.

I take that back. This patch wants the seed in the context. So its just a simple re-basing.

Seriously lame that it took so long. Sorry. Jonathan, if you need this for any of the product branches, could you twiddle the flags and request approval accordingly? Otherwise this will flow into m-c with the next TM merge.

No sweat - let's see whether nightly testers uncover any excitement - feels pretty safe to take on branch, but I'm not clamoring for it yet, either. I'll tweak the flag anyhow, so that we get to it in the next triage pass.

Assuming this bakes on trunk without incident, it is a minor security fix and I think I understand Andreas to believe it's pretty safe as well.

I don't know yet if third party software use these APIs, but this patch breaks ABI on 1.9.2. On 1.9.1, it also slightly unbreaks ABI from the changes from [bug 511328](/show_bug.cgi?id=511328 "RESOLVED FIXED - TM: make Math.random threadlocal").

Good news, none of the third party software using libmozjs in debian use the js\_LeaveTrace and js\_CanLeaveTrace functions which binary compatibility is broken by this change.

You should probably audit that 3rd-party software to make sure that none of it uses js\_\* (contra JS\_\*), because those aren't API.

Backport for 1.9.0
This is a backport of the Math.random() changes (both [bug 511328](/show_bug.cgi?id=511328 "RESOLVED FIXED - TM: make Math.random threadlocal") and this bug) from 1.9.1.10 on 1.9.0.x. We need that on Debian for our stable users, even though Mozilla dropped support for that branch. This backport seems to work properly, though I haven't tested if it does what it is supposed to (is there a known exploit or testcase, btw?)
Anyways, I'd appreciate some more eyes taking a look at this patch.

Backport for 1.9.0
Since Mike posted the backport here and got reviews, I'm going to go ahead and request approval1.9.0.next on his patch so that we can get it in CVS for future non-MoCo-driven 1.9.0-based security releases.
Ordinarily I'd volunteer to check it in, too, except that AFAIK /js is still a restricted partition in CVS, so if this gets approval, I'll need to ask someone with access to the /js partition and who hasn't forgotten how to use CVS to check the backport in there. :(

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-33

## User tracking across sites using Math.random()

Announced
June 22, 2010
Reporter
Amit Klein
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.10
* Firefox 3.5.12
* Firefox 3.6.4
* Firefox 3.6.9
* SeaMonkey 2.0.5

### Description

Security researcher **Amit Klein** reported that it
was possible to reverse engineer the value used to
seed `Math.random()`. Since the pseudo-random number
generator was only seeded once per browsing session, this seed value
could be used as a unique token to identify and track users across
different web sites.

**Update** (October 27, 2010): After the Firefox 3.6.4
and Firefox 3.5.10 releases, Amit Klein reported that there was an
additional unfixed case where user tracking could occur using the
above-mentioned technique and a pop-up window or iframe that was
subsequently navigated by the user. This additional variant is
identified as CVE-2010-3171.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
