  "CVE-2008-5913": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the Firefox Math.random() function. This function could be used to identify a browsing session and track a user across different websites.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used by Math.random() was only seeded once per browsing session. This allowed an attacker to reverse engineer the seed value and use it as a unique token for tracking users across different websites.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient seeding of the pseudo-random number generator",
        "Predictable seed value generation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could use the predictable output of Math.random() to track users across different websites and potentially correlate browsing sessions, violating their privacy.",
       "attack_vectors": [
          "Visiting a malicious website",
         "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to load a malicious JavaScript on the user's browser. No special privileges are required."
    },
    "additional_details": [
        "The fix involves re-seeding the Math.random() PRNG for each window, frame, and context to make the output less predictable.",
        "This issue affected Firefox, SeaMonkey and other Mozilla-based products.",
         "Several vendors addressed this issue via updates in 2010."
