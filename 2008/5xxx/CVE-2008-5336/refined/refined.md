Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query within the WebStudio CMS. Specifically, the `pageid` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization. This allows attackers to infer information from the database by crafting SQL queries that return different responses based on the truthfulness of conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Compromise of the application:** Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to compromise the WebStudio CMS application.
*   **Access to sensitive data:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Modification of data:** Attackers could modify data within the database, potentially leading to data corruption or manipulation.
*   **Exploitation of latent database vulnerabilities:** The SQL injection could also be used to exploit other vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` page with a manipulated `pageid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without the need for local access.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication.
*   **Knowledge of SQL and the application:** The attacker needs to be aware of SQL syntax and have some basic knowledge of the application's structure to craft the queries.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `pageid` parameter of the `index.php` script.
*   Proof of concept (PoC) exploits are given, demonstrating how to cause a True or False response with crafted queries in the `pageid` parameter, such as:
    *   `http://localhost/index.php?pageid=1+and+1=1` (TRUE)
    *   `http://localhost/index.php?pageid=1+and+1=2` (FALSE)
*  Exploit examples show how to extract database version information
    *    `http://localhost/index.php?pageid=1+and+substring(@@version,1,1)=3` (TRUE)
    *   `http://localhost/index.php?pageid=1+and+substring(@@version,1,1)=4` (FALSE)
    *   `http://localhost/index.php?pageid=1+and+substring(@@version,1,1)=5` (FALSE)

**Additional Information:**
*   **Vendor:** BDigital Media Ltd.
*   **Affected Product:** WebStudio CMS.
*  **Google Dork:** "Powered by WebStudio".
*   **Solution:** The vulnerability is listed as unpatched, with a manual code edit suggested to sanitize user input.
*   **Severity:**  Critical, with CVSS base score of 7.5.
