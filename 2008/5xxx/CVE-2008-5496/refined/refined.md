Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5496:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw in the `showcategory.php` script of PozScripts Business Directory Script. The `cid` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a classic SQL injection. The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input (specifically, the `cid` parameter) before using it in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, including sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and other user data.
- **Data Manipulation:**  Besides reading data, an attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database.
- **Server Compromise:** In some circumstances, this could lead to complete server compromise depending on database privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a malicious HTTP GET request to the `showcategory.php` script. The `cid` parameter is manipulated to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote; no local access is necessary.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring prior authentication to the application.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to construct a working injection payload.

**Exploit Details:**
The provided exploit example is as follows:

```
www.[target].com/Script/showcategory.php?cid=-264+union+select+1,concat(user(),0x3e,version()),3,4,5--
```
This exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to inject SQL code. It attempts to retrieve the database user and version, which are then concatenated.
- `-264`: A negative value likely used to make the union work
- `union select 1,concat(user(),0x3e,version()),3,4,5`: The malicious SQL injection code. This query selects the database user and version by exploiting the SQL injection,  concatenating the user and version information.
- `--`: A comment to ignore the remaining part of the original query
This particular exploit aims to retrieve the database user and database version.
