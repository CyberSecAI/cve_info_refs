Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `com_allhotels` and `com_5starhotels` Joomla components are vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization when handling the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses:**
*   The `id` parameter in the `showhoteldetails` task is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and password hashes.
*   An attacker may be able to modify or delete data in the database.
*   Complete compromise of the database is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is performed via HTTP GET requests.
*   The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL with SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Joomla website.
*   No authentication or special privileges are needed.

**Technical Details:**
*   The provided exploits demonstrate how to inject SQL code using `UNION SELECT` to extract data from the database (e.g., usernames and password hashes from the `jos_users` table).
*   Examples:
    *   `http://www.leveltensolutions.net/spa/index.php?option=com_allhotels&task=showhoteldetails&id=1+and%20substring(@@version,1,1)=5`
    *   `http://www.leveltensolutions.net/spa/index.php?option=com_allhotels&task=showhoteldetails&id=1+and%20substring(@@version,1,1)=4`
   *  `$host = $target . "/index.php?option=com_5starhotels&task=showhoteldetails&id=1+union+select+1,".$column_name."+from/**/".$table_name."--";`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit for `com_5starhotels` is a Perl script that automates the injection process.
*   The `com_allhotels` example uses a blind SQL injection technique.
*   The provided content indicates that these exploits were first published on milw0rm.com.
