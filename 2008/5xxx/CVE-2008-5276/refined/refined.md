        "Integer Overflow",
        "Heap-based buffer overflow"

      "impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted RealMedia file, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
       "attack_vector": "A specially crafted RealMedia (.rm) file.",
