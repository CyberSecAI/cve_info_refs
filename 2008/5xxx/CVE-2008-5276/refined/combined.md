# VLC: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200812-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities in VLC may lead to the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/vlc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.8a** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.8a** |

### Background

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

### Description

Tobias Klein reported the following vulnerabilities:

* A
  stack-based buffer overflow when processing CUE image files in
  modules/access/vcd/cdrom.c (CVE-2008-5032).
* A stack-based
  buffer overflow when processing RealText (.rt) subtitle files in the
  ParseRealText() function in modules/demux/subtitle.c
  (CVE-2008-5036).
* An integer overflow when processing RealMedia
  (.rm) files in the ReadRealIndex() function in real.c in the Real
  demuxer plugin, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2008-5276).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted CUE
image file, RealMedia file or RealText subtitle file, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.9.8a"
```

Overflow Vulnerability
Advisory ID: TKADV2008-013
Revision: 1.1
Release Date: 2008/11/30
Last Modified: 2008/12/20
Date Reported: 2008/11/14
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: VLC media player < 0.9.8a
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Vendor URL: http://www.videolan.org/
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
CVE-ID: CVE-2008-5276
Patch development time: 18 days
======================
Vulnerability Details:
======================
The VLC media player contains an integer overflow vulnerability while
parsing malformed RealMedia (.rm) files. The vulnerability leads to a heap
overflow that can be exploited by a (remote) attacker to execute arbitrary
code in the context of VLC media player.
==================
Technical Details:
==================
Source code file: modules\demux\real.c
[...]
891 static void ReadRealIndex( demux\_t \*p\_demux )
892 {
...
900 uint32\_t i\_index\_count;
...
920 [1] i\_index\_count = GetDWBE( &buffer[10] );
...
931 [2] p\_sys->p\_index =
932 (rm\_index\_t \*)malloc( sizeof( rm\_index\_t ) \*
(i\_index\_count+1) );
933 if( p\_sys->p\_index == NULL )
934 return;
935
936 memset(p\_sys->p\_index, 0, sizeof(rm\_index\_t) \* (i\_index\_count+1));
937
938 [3] for( i=0; is, buffer, 14 ) < 14 )
941 return ;
942
943 [7] if( GetWBE( &buffer[0] ) != 0 )
944 {
945 msg\_Dbg( p\_demux, "Real Index: invaild version of index
entry %d ",
946 GetWBE( &buffer[0] ) );
947 return;
948 }
949
950 [4] p\_sys->p\_index[i].time\_offset = GetDWBE( &buffer[2] );
951 [5] p\_sys->p\_index[i].file\_offset = GetDWBE( &buffer[6] );
952 [6] p\_sys->p\_index[i].frame\_index = GetDWBE( &buffer[10] );
953 msg\_Dbg( p\_demux, "Real Index: time %d file %d frame %d ",
954 p\_sys->p\_index[i].time\_offset,
955 p\_sys->p\_index[i].file\_offset,
956 p\_sys->p\_index[i].frame\_index );
957
958 }
959 }
[...]
[1] User supplied data from the RealMedia file gets copied into
"i\_index\_count".
[2] The value of "i\_index\_count" is used to calculate the size of a heap
buffer. If the value of "i\_index\_count" is big enough (e.g. 0x15555555)
an integer overflow occurs while calculating the size of the heap
buffer. As a consequence it is possible to allocate a small heap buffer
by supplying a big value for "i\_index\_count".
[3] The value of "i\_index\_count" is used as a counter in this for() loop.
[4] User controlled data from the RealMedia file gets copied into the
previously allocated heap buffer (see [2]). As "i" is used as an array
index and the for() loop is executed until "i<i\_index\_count" it is
possible to overflow the heap buffer with user controlled data from the
RealMedia file.
[5] See [4]
[6] See [4]
As there is also an exit condition that can be triggered to stop the
overflow (see [7]) at any given point this leads to a fully controllable
heap overflow that can be exploited by a (remote) attacker to execute
arbitrary code in the context of VLC.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security Advisory 0811

```

Summary           : Buffer overflow in Real demuxer
Date              : November 2008
Affected versions : VLC media player 0.9.8 down to 0.9.0
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-0811
CVE reference     : CVE-2008-5276

```
## Details

When parsing the header of an invalid Real Media file
an integer overflow might occur then trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.

## Impact

If successful,
a malicious third party could trigger execution of arbitrary code
within the context of the VLC media player.

## Threat mitigation

Exploitation of this issue requires the user
to explicitly open a specially crafted file.

## Workarounds

The user should refrain from opening files from untrusted third parties
or accessing untrusted remote sites (or disable the VLC browser plugins),
until the patch is applied.

Alternatively, the Real demuxer plugin
(`libreal_plugin.*`)
can be removed manually from the VLC plugin installation directory.

## Solution

VLC media player 0.9.8a addresses this issue.
Patches for older versions are available
from the official VLC source code repository 0.9-bugfix branch.

## Credits

This vulnerability was reported by Tobias Klein.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
