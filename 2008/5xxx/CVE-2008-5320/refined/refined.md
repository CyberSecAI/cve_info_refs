      {
        "source": "www.exploit-db.com_b7d46b2f_20250124_143655.html",
        "root_cause": "The `usersettings.php` script in e107 versions prior to 0.7.13 is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data used in an SQL query.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "The vulnerability lies in how the keys of the `$_POST['ue']` array are used directly in an SQL update query without proper sanitization.",
          "Specifically, the code iterates through the `$_POST['ue']` array, cleans the values, but not the keys, which are then concatenated into the query string without any check."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information, modification of data, or denial of service.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `usersettings.php` script.",
          "The request includes a malicious SQL injection payload within the keys of the `ue` array."
        ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs a valid user account on the e107 system to trigger this vulnerability. The attacker is also able to send POST requests to the web application."
