      "summary": "The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in Pie Web M{a,e}sher version 0.5.3. Multiple files are vulnerable, some via the 'lib' parameter and others via the 'GLOBALS[pie][library_path]' parameter. An attacker can include a remote file by manipulating these parameters. Examples of vulnerable files include `lib/action/alias.php` and `lib/class/diff.php`." ,
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The application improperly handles user-supplied input by directly including files specified in the `lib` and `GLOBALS[pie][library_path]` parameters, without proper sanitization or validation.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "HTTP GET request with manipulated 'lib' or 'GLOBALS[pie][library_path]' parameters"

       "summary": "Pie Web M{a,e}sher 0.5.3 is vulnerable to Multiple Remote File Inclusion. The vulnerability can be exploited using the 'lib' parameter in multiple files within the `/lib/action/` directory and using the `GLOBALS[pie][library_path]` parameter in multiple files within the `/lib/class/`, `/lib/compiler/` and `/lib/share/` directories. The vulnerability has a high risk, with a CVSS base score of 10/10. It does not require authentication, has a low attack complexity, and can be exploited remotely, with complete impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",

            "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
        ],
        "impact": "Complete compromise of the server, leading to arbitrary code execution and potential full control over the application and underlying system. Complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",

          "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable scripts with crafted `lib` or `GLOBALS[pie][library_path]` parameters."
