      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to extract sensitive data (such as usernames and passwords) from the database, modify data, or even gain control of the database server. In this specific case, the provided exploit demonstrates how to retrieve login credentials from the 'admin_login' and 'users' tables.",

        "The vulnerability is accessible remotely through HTTP requests to the vulnerable 'riddle.php' script."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs no authentication and can exploit the vulnerability through a web browser or a tool that can send HTTP requests. The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with SQL injection payload in the 'riddleid' parameter."
