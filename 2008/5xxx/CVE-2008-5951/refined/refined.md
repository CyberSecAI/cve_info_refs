{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the `mcatid` parameter within `media_level.asp`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "File Disclosure"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can retrieve sensitive information such as user names and passwords from the database by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability. File disclosure is also possible through direct access of the database file `templatemonster.mdb`.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable `media_level.asp` page, specifically through the `mcatid` parameter. Direct access to the database file is also possible.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the application. No special privileges are required."
