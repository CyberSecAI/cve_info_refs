Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-5349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) handles certain RSA public keys. Specifically, a crafted RSA public key can cause the JRE to consume an excessive amount of CPU resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to a denial-of-service attack via crafted RSA keys. The JRE does not properly limit resource consumption when processing such keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CPU Exhaustion:** Successful exploitation leads to the JRE consuming excessive CPU resources, effectively causing a DoS condition. This can make the system running the vulnerable JRE unresponsive or severely degraded in performance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Client Interaction:**  A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted RSA public key to an application running within the vulnerable JRE environment. This key could be supplied as part of an application interaction, or it could be part of a network communication, for example.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to send malicious data (the crafted RSA public key) to a system running the vulnerable JRE. This could be over a network or by enticing a user to interact with a malicious application.
- **No Special Privileges:** The vulnerability can be exploited without special privileges on the target system, since the vulnerability resides in the JRE itself.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability impacts multiple security providers: IBMJCE, IBMPKCS11Impl, and IBMJCEFIPS.
- The vulnerability affects Sun JDK/JRE and IBM Java, and OpenJDK as well.
- Several vendors, such as Sun, IBM and Red Hat, have released patches to address this issue
- Exploitation may lead to "OS resource consumption" specifically with Kerberos authentication.
