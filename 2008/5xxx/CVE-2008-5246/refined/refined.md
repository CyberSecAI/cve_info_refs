Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5246:

**Summary:**

CVE-2008-5246 is a vulnerability affecting the xine-devel package. It's one of several buffer overflow issues discovered while parsing media files. These vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple buffer overflows occur during file parsing within the xine-devel library.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Multiple buffer overflows in xine-devel, specifically when parsing various media files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these buffer overflows can lead to remote code execution on the affected system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The attack vector involves parsing specially crafted media files, which an attacker would likely need to deliver to the target system via a suitable method. The specific attack vectors are not described beyond the processing of malicious files, so the method to get the file to the target is not explicit, but likely include email, websites, or file shares.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to create a malicious media file that triggers the specific buffer overflow and then deliver it to the victim's system and have them attempt to process it.

**Affected Products:**
* openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES9, SLE10-SP2

**Additional Notes:**

*   The SUSE security advisory lists CVE-2008-5246 along with several other related CVEs affecting the xine-devel package, all stemming from similar buffer overflow issues.
*   The advisory emphasizes that these bugs can lead to remote code execution.
*   The issue was resolved by updating the xine-devel package.
