Here's a breakdown of the information regarding CVE-2008-5517 from the provided documents:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the improper sanitization of shell metacharacters in the `gitweb` interface when processing certain commands related to `git_snapshot` and `git_object`. Specifically, arguments used in the Perl `open()` function were not properly sanitized. This lack of sanitization allowed for the injection of arbitrary commands.
- The vulnerability is related to the ability of `gitweb` to execute external diff commands based on the `diff.external` configuration parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Shell Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the injection of shell metacharacters. The lack of proper input validation or sanitization allows attackers to insert malicious shell commands.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The gitweb interface doesn't sanitize inputs used to construct arguments for the Perl `open()` function calls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the user running the gitweb CGI scripts.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Users with write access to the git repository configuration can exploit this vulnerability to run commands with the permissions of the git web server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability through crafted requests to the git web interface.
- **Local Attack:** A user with write access to the git repository can modify the `diff.external` configuration parameter to inject arbitrary commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote attacker:** Needs the ability to send crafted requests to the gitweb interface through the network.
- **Local attacker:** Needs write access to a git repositoryâ€™s configuration files.

**Technical Details & Descriptions:**

- The vulnerability resides in `gitweb`, a web interface for the Git version control system.
- The vulnerability affects the `git_snapshot` and `git_object` functionalities within `gitweb`.
- Patches include using `quote_command()` to sanitize input.
- The issues were fixed upstream in various Git branches, but the security implications were not immediately recognized.
-  There seems to be some confusion initially about which CVE was assigned to which issue: initially, the vulnerability regarding the `diff.external` setting was mistakenly associated with CVE-2008-5517 before it was corrected.

**Affected versions:**
- git versions *before* 1.5.6 are affected. Specifically, 1.5.x versions.
- Debian: Etch is affected, fixed in 1.4.4.4-4+etch1. Unstable/testing (lenny) were also affected.

**Mitigation:**

- Upgrade to a version that includes the fix (1.5.6 or later).
- Apply patches provided by distributions.

**Additional Notes:**

-   Some sources mention the diff.external parameter being used in exploitation, this was later clarified as CVE-2008-5916.
-   Red Hat initially fixed the vulnerability using the patch from <http://repo.or.cz/w/git.git?a=commitdiff;h=516381d5>
-   SUSE fixed this vulnerability along with CVE-2008-5516 using `quote_command()`.
-   Ubuntu:  Affected versions include 6.06, 7.10, 8.04, and 8.10.
-   Gentoo: `dev-util/git` versions prior to `1.6.0.6` are vulnerable.

In summary, CVE-2008-5517 describes a remote code execution vulnerability in the `gitweb` interface due to improper handling of shell metacharacters when processing commands, particularly impacting versions of `git` before 1.5.6. The vulnerability allows for remote code execution as the user running gitweb.
