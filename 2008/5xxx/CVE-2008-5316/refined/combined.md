Subject: CVE request: lcms (old issues)

Hi!

While digging around CVE-2007-2741, I found out that there are 2 other
issues that were quite silently fixed in the Little CMS updates tagged
as fixing CVE-2007-2741 as done by various vendors.

The issues are:

The ReadEmbeddedTextTag in src/cmsio1.c did not properly check amount
of data read from the input file to the buffer provided as one of it's
arguments.  Value read from the file was used as an upper bound without
any validation.

This issue was fixed upstream in 1.16.  Attached is the patch against
1.15 lcms packages as was used in SuSE security updates (original name
of the patch as used in SuSE and Mandriva SRPMS is
lcms-CVE-2007-2741.patch, but it is not a fix for CVE-2007-2741,
CVE-2007-2741 was fixed upstream in 1.15 and the correct patch for it
is named named liblcms-<version>-icc.diff in pre-1.15 SuSE / Mandriva
SRPMS).

Upstream CVS commit:
<http://lcms.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lcms/lcms/src/cmsio1.c?r1=1.33&r2=1.34>

Another issue is unsigned -> signed integer cast issue in cmsAllocGamma
in src/cmsgamma.c.  The argument to this function - nEntries - may be
read from the file and not validated before cmsAllocGamma is called.
As nEntries in cmsAllocGamma is signed integer, it's value may possibly
be negative and can result in an insufficient memory allocation.

This issue was fixed upstream in 1.17.  Again, attached is the patch
extracted from SuSE security updates for 1.15.  Original name was
lcms-gamma-overflow.patch.

Upstream CVS commit:
<http://lcms.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lcms/lcms/src/cmsgamma.c?view=diff&r1=1.16&r2=1.17>

As both of these fixes date back to 2007, and were used in the security
advisory in 2007, they may need 2007 CVE id.  Steven, can you get us
some?  Thank you!

CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-5316 CVE-2008-5317

Two vulnerabilities have been found in lcms, a library and set of
commandline utilities for image color management.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2008-5316

    Inadequate enforcement of fixed-length buffer limits allows an
    attacker to overflow a buffer on the stack, potentially enabling
    the execution of arbitrary code when a maliciously-crafted
    image is opened.

CVS-2008-5317

    An integer sign error in reading image gamma data could allow an
    attacker to cause an under-sized buffer to be allocated for
    subsequent image data, with unknown consequences potentially
    including the execution of arbitrary code if a maliciously-crafted
    image is opened.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.14-1.1+etch1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny), and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems are fixed in version 1.17.dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your lcms packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
