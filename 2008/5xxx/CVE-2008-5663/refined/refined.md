Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-5663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple unrestricted file upload issues in Kusaba versions 1.0.4 and earlier. Specifically, the `paint_save.php` and `load_receiver.php` scripts allow users to upload files without proper checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary weakness is the lack of restrictions on file uploads. Attackers can upload files with executable extensions, such as `.php`.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The application doesn't properly validate user-supplied data and file content.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a file containing malicious PHP code, attackers can achieve remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Complete Compromise:** The attacker can gain complete control over the affected system, as indicated by the CVSS subscores (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are all "Complete").

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload via `paint_save.php`:** An attacker can craft a special HTTP POST request to `paint_save.php`, embedding malicious PHP code within the image or animation data that gets saved as a PHP file with a name that is supplied by the attacker.
*   **File Upload via `load_receiver.php`:** If the `load_receiver.php` script has not been modified, an attacker can upload a file with a malicious PHP backdoor by submitting a specially crafted POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, i.e., from the internet.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, but only single time authentication is required.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The exploitation is straightforward, requiring low complexity.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to upload a PHP backdoor using both `paint_save.php` and `load_receiver.php`.
*   The backdoor uses `eval()` or `passthru()` to execute arbitrary commands passed via GET parameters `pc` or `sc`, respectively, after stripping slashes and URL-decoding the input.
*   The `paint_save.php` exploit requires sending specifically formatted data, including a shellcode payload, image data, and other parameters.
*   The `load_receiver.php` exploit takes advantage of a publicly available upload script that is part of the application and expects a password which by default is `changeme`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes links to other resources, such as Exploit-DB and SecurityFocus, which contain additional information about this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is related to CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 9.0, which indicates a critical severity level.
