# CVE-2008-5113

| **Name** | CVE-2008-5113 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | WordPress 2.6.3 relies on the REQUEST superglobal array in certain dangerous situations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct delayed and persistent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks via crafted cookies, as demonstrated by attacks that (1) delete user accounts or (2) cause a denial of service (loss of application access). NOTE: this issue relies on the presence of an independent vulnerability that allows cookie injection. |

Package: wordpress
Version: 2.0.7-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security

Hi,

Due to the completely incorrect usage of $_REQUEST almost all over the place
wordpress is subject to delayed attacks via cookies.

The attack can be performed as long as there is some way to inject a cookie
which is sent by the browser to the server. Note that this means that some
XSS vulnerability in wordpress or in any other service, or even by visiting a
malicious site under the same domain could lead to any of the following (and
even lots more) attacks.

Attack: Denial Of Service
Required cookies: GLOBALS=<anything>
Triggering file: index.php (just an example, basically any file including the
affected file)
Affected file: wp-settings.php
Effect: no request is processed as it aborts because of the presence of
GLOBALS in $_REQUEST

Attack: Deletion of users
Required cookies: action=dodelete, delete_option=delete, users[]=n (where n is
an integer)
Triggering file: wp-admin/users.php
Affected file: wp-admin/users.php
Note: this doesn't affect etch's version as it correctly uses $_POST

Attack: Denial Of Service
Required cookies: action=logout
Triggering file: wp-login.php
Affected file: wp-login.php
Effect: redirection loop, preventing the user from logging in

etc

Hi,

I don't think this is a grave security issue. It is only a DoS for one client
application, which requires another vulnerability to be present, can be
easily resolved by deleting the relevant cookies, and does no other harm. As
there are many ways to DoS (web)applications and the impact is small I
suggest to downgrade the severity to normal.

It would be good to fix the bug of course.

I agree that the problem exists but I don't think it's a grave one.
As you said, before exploiting wordpress we need to inject a maliciuos
cookie and if we can do such things I really don't think the problem is
going to be wordpress.

At the moment there are no known XSS isues for wordpress (in lenny/sid
and experimental) so I think the problem really applies to etch only
(for which we still have [CVE-2008-2068](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2068) and [CVE-2007-4483](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4483)).

At the moment the entire wordpress structure is base on the use of
$_REQUEST and this is obviously one of the worst errors developers could
do; the changes to apply to get rid of this bad use of $_REQUEST are
really important so I don't think I should do something without the help
of upstream developers.

As soon as the CVE gets confirmed I'll file a bug upstream asking to
modify wordpress to use $_GET $_POST and $_COOKIES.

Thank you very much for reporting this.

Cheers.

Andrea De Iacovo

It is not just about the DoS (because as I demonstrated, there are
other possible attacks).
The whole point is that wordpress' (ab)use of $_REQUEST is leading to
more and more possible attacks (as I also demonstrated by showing how
etch's version is less worst than lenny's).

> easily resolved by deleting the relevant cookies, and does no other harm. As

Yes, but it only applies to some cases. The users deletion attack can
only be noticed a) if you are paranoid and check the cookies before
you log in, b) when you wonder why wordpress says it deleted some
users without even asking you when all you did was take a look at the
users administration page!

> there are many ways to DoS (web)applications and the impact is small I

I do really believe it deservers to be considered as critical;
although if you (or anyone else from the team) really insists I would
not accept anything below important. Think about web hosting services
where they share the same domain but use a different subdomain, it is
possible for one site to inject cookies that will affect the others.

There are many other possible attacks via cookies, I only reported the
first ones I found via a quick grep on the source code.

bug*s*, and make sure upstream gets the "please stop using $_REQUEST!" message".

Think about this situation:
You have a blog hosting account at domain.tld, they provide you a
subdomain called 'myblog' (i.e. myblog.domain.tld). Other folks just
like you do also have their blogs or websites or they whatever hosted
by domain.tld (anotherblog.domain.tld, www.domain.tld,
myshop.domain.tld, etc).
If any of those many sites has a an XSS vulnerability, or anything
else that could lead to the injection of a cookie for the
'.domain.tld' domain *everyone* would be affected.

All attacks can be done only by setting malicious cookies.
With a standard apache/php configuration, cookies can only be set for
the current subdomain (foo.bar.com) and not for the entire domain
(.bar.com).
However you can act on the php.ini changing the domain value with a php
script but I don't think that's wordpress' fault if the server
administrator allows you to dinamically change such configuration with a
simple script! 99% of the public hoster which give you a
yourname.hoster.com do not allow you to change the domain value for the
cookies and so should people do if hosting multiple websites with teir
debian machine.

As I said if they allow such dangerous practises as dinamic change of
php.ini values that's not wordpress' fault.
You can exploit almost every web application overwriting it's cookies!

Being one of the folks working on the php5 package lately I don't know
of any such apache or php configuration that restricts the domain of a
cookie. PHP has session.cookie_domain, but it does only work for the
session cookies of PHP's built-in session manager.

You can also set cookies via javascript code, e.g.
<script>document.cookie = "GLOBALS=1;domain=.domain.tld"; </script>

Invalid argument for both reasons: a) there's no such directive in
php.ini b) if there were such a directive, it would have a security
exception just like for magic_quotes, safe_mode, and other b0rken by
design options.

> You can exploit almost every web application overwriting it's cookies!

The problem here is that a) they have predictable names, b) they are
not just storing data but actually making the script do something it
was not requested to do (cookies, just like GET and POST request
methods, have some specific purpose. $_REQUEST should only be used
where it doesn't matter at all what kind of request it is, IOW:
never).

Ok I was misinterpreting a man page.

ok that's true.

So let's see what we have:
1. $_REQUEST references are widely used in wordpress.
2. the standard EGPCS makes cookies overwrite GET and POST values in
$_REQUEST
3. such values are used in "dangerous" cases (such as user deletion or
logout after redirection).
4. "grave" data loss (user, post, comments deletion) could be avoided
not logging in as administrator (but only as a user with some
privileges)
5. the issue is related to wordpress only and does not influence other
parts of the system
6. we can try to prepare a workaround while we wait an officile fix from
upstream: maybe I could implement a function to check out if dangerous
cookies are present and stop any other operation until those cookies are
not removed.

So I agree that I absolutely have to solve the bug(s) but I keep
thinking it should be set as important instead of grave.

Thank you very much for all your help with the issue.
If you need more information just ask me, please.

Cheers.

Andrea

All fine, although 4 is more a social than a technical problem, as
there is no way we can force users to do that (although I definitely
agree that it is a way to mitigate many possible issues).

You better not, that's how the GLOBALS DoS work.

But please do work with upstream so the changes actually take place up there.
Like I said to Thijs: although I do believe that the whole situation
makes it a critical issue, I am ok if the consensus turns out to be
that it isn't critical, as long as the severity isn't dropped to
anything below important.

There is an easy fix suggestion at
<http://brian.moonspot.net/2008/01/17/responsible-use-of-the-_request-variable/>

$user_input = array_merge($_GET, $_POST);

or even better:

if(!empty($_POST)){
$user_input = $_POST;
} elseif {
$user_input = $_GET;
}

Now replace all usage of $_REQUEST with $user_input. Sounds safe, but
needs testing.. in case wordpress actually reads cookie values from
$_REQUEST (yuck).

Regards,

Richard

As for sure I can mention something in the readme file with the next
release.

I think I did not explain this well.
GLOBALS DoS works because the application simply dies without explicit
errors or something like that.
I think I could do something like:
	function check_maliciuos_cookies(){
		$malicius = array("action", "GLOBALS", "ANYTHING_ELSE");
		foreach ($_COOKIES as $cname => $cvalue)
			foreach ($malicious as $mname => $mvalue)
				if ($cname == $mname)
					die("Malicious cookie detected. Please delete cookies for this host
and come back");
	}

Obviously the code should have a better optimization, this was just an
example.

Richard, the solution you suggested would make me modify the whole
wordpress code. For such great changes I think it's better to work with
upstream.

Thank you all.

Cheers.

Andrea

Sure (OT: you may want to review the setup procedure too, because last

It works because it is incorrect. Being unclear is another problem, though.

The best solution is to respect the pourpose of GET, POST, and COOKIES.

I'm still not very much convinced because there are plenty of other attack
vectors out there in the code; it is just a matter of grepping for _REQUEST
in the source code and check what they are used for.

For example: another look at the code revealed that wp_get_referer can be
abused to redirect the admin to whatever site is specified in a cookie
called '_wp_http_referer' under certaim circumstances.

Also, setting a 'delete_comments' cookie will cause a minor DoS when trying to
perform several actions on the comments (via edit-comments.php). That would
be a nice play to prevent the admin from deleting spam comments for a while.

hi guys,

has anyone considered something like richard's suggestion in msg 48?  if the
sev is not going to be downgraded to important, that's probably the best
way forward wrt lenny...

it shouldn't be too hard to make a new global variable or function in some
centrally included location, and have that variable/function "safely" mimick
the REQUEST variable's behaviour.

regarding richard's comments about cases where cookie values might
be used via the REQUEST variable, i'd be highly skeptical that
this was going on, but then again we're dealing with a php webapp, so...
i think to rule that out you just need to cross-reference with a recursive
grep -i for cookie and make sure there are no overlapping variables in
usage of REQUEST.

Andrea, you are the maintainer, it's up to you to downgrade the bug if you
really believe that the severity is over-inflated.

I tend to agree that important is enough. It would be better to have a fix
but if we don't have any, it's not a reason to remove the package from
lenny.

You could however document the problem in README.Debian until it's
properly solved.

Andrea, how did it progress with upstream ?

Cheers,

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in wordpress, weblog
manager. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2008-6762

It was discovered that wordpress is prone to an open redirect
vulnerability which allows remote attackers to conduct phishing atacks.

CVE-2008-6767

It was discovered that remote attackers had the ability to trigger an
application upgrade, which could lead to a denial of service attack.

CVE-2009-2334

It was discovered that wordpress lacks authentication checks in the
plugin configuration, which might leak sensitive information.

CVE-2009-2854

It was discovered that wordpress lacks authentication checks in various
actions, thus allowing remote attackers to produce unauthorised edits or
additions.

CVE-2009-2851

It was discovered that the administrator interface is prone to a
cross-site scripting attack.

CVE-2009-2853

It was discovered that remote attackers can gain privileges via certain
direct requests.

CVE-2008-1502

It was discovered that the _bad_protocol_once function in KSES, as used
by wordpress, allows remote attackers to perform cross-site scripting
attacks.

CVE-2008-4106

It was discovered that wordpress lacks certain checks around user
information, which could be used by attackers to change the password of
a user.

CVE-2008-4769

It was discovered that the get_category_template function is prone to a
directory traversal vulnerability, which could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-4796

It was discovered that the _httpsrequest function in the embedded snoopy
version is prone to the execution of arbitrary commands via shell
metacharacters in https URLs.

CVE-2008-5113

It was discovered that wordpress relies on the REQUEST superglobal array
in certain dangerous situations, which makes it easier to perform
attacks via crafted cookies.

Subject:  CVE request: wordpress can be subject of delayed attacks via cookies

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

Due to the completely incorrect usage of $_REQUEST almost all over the place
wordpress is subject to delayed attacks via cookies.

The attack can be performed as long as there is some way to inject a cookie
which is sent by the browser to the server.

More info at <http://bugs.debian.org/504771>

Could a CVE id be assigned please?

Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,
