Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-5113:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from WordPress's improper use of the `$_REQUEST` superglobal array in multiple locations throughout the code. This array combines the values from `$_GET`, `$_POST`, and `$_COOKIE`, which leads to the possibility of malicious cookie injection overriding expected request data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via Cookie Injection:** The primary issue is that attackers can inject crafted cookies. Because `$_REQUEST` is used to access data, these injected cookies can be used to perform actions on the WordPress site without the user's consent.
- **Incorrect use of `$_REQUEST`:**  The application uses `$_REQUEST` instead of using the appropriate `$_GET`, `$_POST`, or `$_COOKIE` arrays for their intended purposes which allows for cookie values to be used in contexts where they should not be.
- **Lack of input validation:** The application lacks proper validation and sanitization of input parameters, making it vulnerable to crafted requests via cookies.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can inject a `GLOBALS` cookie which causes the application to abort and prevents legitimate requests from processing. Another DoS can be achieved by injecting an `action=logout` cookie, which causes a redirect loop and prevents the user from logging in.
- **User Account Deletion:** An attacker can inject cookies with parameters like `action=dodelete`, `delete_option=delete`, and `users[]=n` (where n is an integer representing the user id) to delete user accounts.
- **Other potential attacks:** As noted in the bug report, the improper usage of `$_REQUEST` could lead to further attacks. For example, the `wp_get_referer` function could be exploited with a `_wp_http_referer` cookie to redirect the administrator to a malicious site, and the `delete_comments` cookie could create a denial of service when managing comments.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Cookie Injection:** The attack relies on the attacker's ability to inject cookies into the victim's browser that will be sent to the vulnerable WordPress site. This injection can happen in different ways:
    - **XSS Vulnerability:** Exploiting an existing XSS vulnerability on the WordPress site or another site under the same domain.
    - **Malicious Site:** The user visiting a malicious website that is capable of setting cookies for the same domain as the WordPress site.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to inject cookies:** The attacker needs to be able to inject cookies that are sent to the WordPress site.
- **No direct interaction with the application required:** The attacks happen when a victim visits the WordPress site with the injected cookies.
- **Vulnerable WordPress version:**  The target must be running a vulnerable version of WordPress (2.6.3 or earlier).

**Additional Notes**
- The issue is made more serious by the fact that in shared hosting environments, a vulnerability in one subdomain could potentially be used to inject cookies for other subdomains in the same domain.
- The bug report also mentions that a proposed fix is to make `$_REQUEST` only use `$_GET` and `$_POST` values and not `$_COOKIE`.
- The severity of the bug was initially set to grave, then changed to important due to the required cookie injection vector being an additional vulnerability.
