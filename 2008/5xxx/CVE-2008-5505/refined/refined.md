{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `persist` attribute in XUL elements allows storing cookie-like data bypassing usual cookie restrictions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `persist` attribute in XUL elements can store information even when cookies are disabled. It also bypasses cookie size and number limits, creating a persistent and difficult to manage tracking mechanism. This mechanism is not controlled by the user's cookie preferences.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A website could track users across browsing sessions even when cookies are disabled, store large amounts of persistent data, and bypass user privacy settings regarding cookies.",
  "Attack vectors": "By using a XUL page with the persist attribute, any site can use this to store tracking information",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious or compromised XUL page."
