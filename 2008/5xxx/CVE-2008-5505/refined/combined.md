List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Core :: XUL

For bugs in the [XUL
language](http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe/xptoolkit/xulintro.html). (XUL is an XML-based language which specifies Mozilla's user interface.)

If you're not actually writing XUL code, this is probably not the right place for your bug.

Examples of appropriate bugs: Duplicate window ID causes infinite loop; or Scrollbars disappear after loading XUL document

When user turns off cookies, I still can write cookie-like information by using
the xul persist attribute on a remote page.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
<xul:element id="test" persist="att1,att2" />
Store:
document.getElementById('test').setAttribute('att1','xxx');
Restore:
alert(document.getElementById('test').getAttribute('att1'));
Expected Results:
I expect a remote XUL page being able to work with the persist attribute but
onla when the user allows cookies from this site.

They're entirely separate concepts and expecting that a policy about cookies
automatically applies to any form of persistent data is a false assumption.
That said, this seems to be more of a privacy issue than of actual security.
There's also the aspect that even if you load "foo.xul" in a hidden iframe from
a third party (in order to track in a pseudo-cookie manner) this is of far less
value, since manipulating the content in the hidden iframe would/should fail a
same-origin check.

There are definite privacy implications here. Not so much in the default case
since cookies are on by default, but this easily bypasses restrictions on cookie
size and number, and could not be managed or deleted by users.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWComponent: Security → XP Toolkit/Widgets: XULEver confirmed: trueFlags: blocking-aviary1.1?Keywords: [privacy](/buglist.cgi?keywords=privacy&resolution=---)Product: Firefox → CoreQA Contact: firefox → xptoolkit.xulWhiteboard: [sg:fix]Version: unspecified → Trunk

Hish, I tried to create a testcase to illustrate this but failed to reproduce
the described behavior. I'm not much of a XUL coder, so it is probably my
failing. Could you attach a XUL file containing a working testcase illustrating
the problem?

We should require at least UniversalBrowserWrite to persist information, if not
restrict it to chrome entirely. nsXULTreeBuilder already requires chrome privs
to use anything other than an in-memory datasource, so that's a consistent
choice and quite possibly the easiest.
<http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/content/xul/templates/src/nsXULTreeBuilder.cpp#798>

xul:persist is an important part of remote XUL and we should not remove the
capability arbitrarily. If we want to come up with some solution to restrict it
based on cookie prefs etc. that's ok.

Exactly. Restricting it to UniversalBrowserWrite would again mean to cut a
feature. At the end of the day this persistency is nothing else but a cookie
which the user might reject. Best would be if could optionally be able to treat
it like a session cookie.

Treat it like a cookie? You mean let any site store as much as they want (unlike
cookies which have a limit) without the average user knowing (this wouldn't show
up in the cookie viewer) until the whole thing blows up on us like the Flash
"PIE" thing recently did? Except Flash \*did\* have a built in mechanism for
limiting remote storage and simply chose generous defaults, and we don't even
have that.
I was going to recommend that XUL apps just \*use\* cookies and take advantage of
all of the existing user controls and security checks, but the document.cookie
mechanism is apparently not supported in XUL. It probably should be, it looks
like a whole lot less work than adding a parallel set of controls and limits.

IMHO the best solution here would be to extend our various cookie mechanisms
such that we can treat persistent attributes just like cookies. This means
limiting the storage size of each individual sites usage and the total storage
size (though chrome xul should override these limits). It also means making
persisted attributes show up in the cookie manager and make them be cleared
along with cookies in the FF privacy-thingie (don't remember the name).
I do realize that this might be non-trivial though.
But if this is done well enough we could also let pages persist other things,
such as form-values and even parts of the DOM tree.

|  | |

I should add that doing that would probably be more of a long term solution. For
now maybe we could make xul support .cookies and limit persitent attributes to
chrome?

#8: Use cookies within xul. Sounds good.
#10: What do you think we need persists here? Window sizes and positions,
selected states etc. within remote apps. When you limit that to chrome then
another important feature of remote apps is broken.
Like Daniel Veditz I think that storing unlimited data via persist is dangerous.
But what I'm talking about less than 1k per app.
So why not treating persist like a cookie. They have their defined limitations,
the user knows (or should know) what they are, and in fact 'xul persist' is
nothing else.
I'm viewing the whole discussion from my well known remote-app perspective and
I'm really curious if we end like most of the time in disabling a feature
instead of fixing the problem.

I defenetly agree that the best solution is not to kill the persist feature, but
to fix it. However it's a matter of what we can do quick enough for a security
release.
If we enable cookies instead of persist you can still do the exact same thing
and persist positions etc, you just have to go through a little bit of a trouble
to copy attribute-values into a cookie when the window is closed and then copy
it back from the cookie when its opened. You could probably even write a utility
function that did this automatically.
But yeah, ideally i'd like to see the RightThing done right away.
Maybe a relativly simple fix is to hack the persist code so that it behaves
similar to the cookie code for now.

It seems to me that implementing xul:persist in terms of cookies would not be
all that hard for remote content, I can look at that possibility for 1.0.6/1.1b.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=190749&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=295994&attachment=190749)

I am going to attach two versions of this patch: this one (the smaller one)
keeps the existing "restore" codepath from localstore which restores attributes
even if they don't have a persist attribute any more.
The second version uses a nsContentList enumerator and walks the tree to
restore persist in both the localstore and cookie cases, which will fix the
mostly-duplicate [bug 231333](/show_bug.cgi?id=231333 "NEW - Unexpected persist when the persisted attribute name contains another"), [bug 231334](/show_bug.cgi?id=231334 "NEW - Persisted attribute values should be removed after the attribute is removed from persist list"), and [bug 251273](/show_bug.cgi?id=251273 "NEW - Better attribute persistence"), but has a much higher
chance of causing Ts/TXul regressions.

Part 2, rev.2 - Use cookies to persist/restore in nsXULDocument
>+ // The format of a persist cookie is <URIspec>#<ID>#<attname>
>+ nsCAutoString cookiename;
>+ rv = mDocumentURI->GetSpec(cookiename);
So a URI with a '#' in it is going to mess you up, right? I guess it's not too
likely to happen in normal practice, but could anything malicious be done with
it? Are there elements we don't allow to persist that this could be used to get
some persistence for anyway?
We probably want to set the cookie path from the documentURI so this cookie
doesn't pollute higher level pages on the site. If we've got the right path
would it be enough to use just the filename instead of the full URI? That
assumes we can QI to nsIURL and get the extra filename/query/ref etc bits out
of the location, but for http: and ftp: we can.
Is there a better separator that's not legal in either URIs or ID's?
What happens for non-chrome XUL documents that don't have a host? We wouldn't
want a local file:// testpage to accidentally share a jar:<http://foo.com/>
persist cookie (although maybe we handle jar:http: cookies correctly). Maybe
the full URI in the cookie name is the right thing afterall, though verbose.
>+ // we pick a value for expire that is 100 years in the future.
Seems a little extreme.

No. We always form the URI the same way, we never "parse" a cookie looking for
URL/ID/attribute.

Sounds reasonable.

I wanted "forever", but we don't really support that. What is extreme about it?
The user's max-age cookie preferences are still obeyed.

I misread your comment a bit... I think we should still always set the full URL
in the cookie, but I have also set the cookie path/ when available to avoid
polluting the cookiespace more than necessary.

Hmm... so the new Cookie Service interface exists for performance? Is the cost
of building up a cookie string really that significant?

Setting cookies doesn't look especially perf-intensive: \*parsing\* the cookie
string does look quite complicated and very hard to make perf-efficient.

Parsing cookie strings is expensive relative to what? To page load time?
Surely not. That said, it's not that I'm against the new API. It just seems
like extra engineering for very little gain :-/

Maybe it can be made not part of a critical codepath if we arrange the code
correctly (get the cookies before entering the contentlist loop), but it's still
a lot of parsing code which I frankly don't know how to write (I never learned
to use cookies from the DOM, and there seem to be lots of "extras" that require
special handling), and to do it efficiently I think I'd have to keep a
parsed-cookie hashtable on the stack while I'm resolving persistence. Overall I
tend to think that the current approach reduces the overall amount of code and
performs better.

why does this need to be scriptable? if possible, i'd prefer this interface to
be internal - it exposes details of cookies that can easily change in future,
so there should be no illusion of API compat. (i'm not sure if we have a
convention either way, but perhaps nsICookieServiceInternal would be a better
name?)

can you document the fact that it returns the first cookie found if there are

Part 2, rev. 2.2 - Use cookies to persist/restore in nsXULDocument
The nsXULDocument.h include changes should probably be removing both
halves, or as much as possible of both so things still compile.
In PersistToCookie, at the very least assert right after
mDocumentURI->GetSpec that cookiename does not contain '#' (but it
should be a runtime check if it could be needed; I'm not sure if it is).
(Likewise for ApplyPersistFromCookies, I think.)
In PersistToCookie, you shouldn't depend on the ID attribute not having
a '#' in it. You should either add code to escape it or bail out if it
contains a '#'.
(Likewise for ApplyPersistFromCookies, I think.)
Then again, if it's \*only\* the ID attribute that could have a '#' then
at least persistence couldn't get crossed, so this isn't a problem, as
long as ApplyPersistFromCookies builds up the string rather than
enumerating cookies (which would probably be superior, but isn't what
you're doing).
In PersistToCookie, you should probably put the expiry initialization
within |if (rv == NS\_CONTENT\_ATTR\_HAS\_VALUE)| for two reasons: (1) save
the work of initializing expiry (PR\_Now() may not be cheap) and (2) the
way the current code is structured, it's easy for somebody to
accidentally add an assignment to rv between the assignment from
GetAttr's result and the check.
I really don't understand why you use the domain and path values for the
cookie that you do, but SetCookieValue doesn't seem all that well
documented. Is what you're doing the right way to make the cookie
specific to the page? If so, say so in a comment, since it's not clear
to me.
In ApplyPersistFromCookies, nsContentList is reference counted; you
shouldn't delete it. It's also got expensive liveness code; do you
really need that? (I didn't check that the constructor call actually
makes sense; I didn't find good documentation for what those constructor
parameters mean.)
Why does ApplyPersistFromCookies pass PR\_FALSE for aNotify to SetAttr
when ApplyPersistFromLocalstore passes PR\_TRUE?
I didn't review the new version of ApplyPersistFromLocalstore; this
should be superreviewed before it is enabled.
Is it a problem that you're changing the behavior when an attribute used
to be part of the persist attribute (and has a persisted value) but no
longer is part of that attribute? I think this change is probably good,
but it should be documented, it could easily break things, and so far
you're changing only for the cookie case, since the ifdef for new
persistence code for localstore isn't enabled. You're also currently
changing this only for the persistence to cookie case, since the
CONTENTLIST ifdefs aren't enabled, but it would be easy to make it true
for all cases even with the non-nsContentList code by checking the
persist attribute before restoring. And enumerating and checking the
persist attribute before restoring might generally be a
better-performing solution for both cases (I'm assuming that elements
with IDs are added to a map when they're created so it's easy to find
them). (Have you tested the performance of this nsContentList
solution?)
Another place where you're breaking compatibility (although without the
CONTENTLIST ifdef only for the cookie case) is what I'd also consider a
bug fix, but it should probably be document: previously
persist="abcdef" persisted attributes "abcdef", "a", "c", "cde", etc.,
since nsXULDocument::AttributeChanged only did a substring check. We'll
\*still\* be doing the work to persist those (but probably shouldn't be),
but we'll never restore them, at least for some of the persistence
codepaths. That deserves at least an XXX comment, but we probably
shouldn't persist them at all if we're not going to restore them.

Question about this patch:
1) Is it going to happen for FF 1.5?
2) How will this impact web traffic if a remote XUL application persists some
stuff? It seems to me that the web traffic would start to include a bunch of
cookies, or am I missing something?

Why is this not blocking 1.9? Unlimited, unclearable, unblockable, invisible "cookies" are bad. Look at the rumblings as people discover DOM globalStorage, and that actually has a defensible privacy story.Flags: blocking1.9- → blocking1.9?

I suspect its not a blocker because its sg:low at this point.
I'm tempted to just break persist in remote XUL by default, but I think that remote XUL is something we want to kill in the medium to long term in favour of better HTML. I'm not yet ready to have that battle, I think that's best timed for Moz2.
Right now the globalStorage stuff gets cleared when cookies get cleared, is tying xul persist to this, and the global cookie prefs (like domstorage also already does) sufficient? I think its unlikely that anyone using this wouldn't also be using cookies, so anyone caring enough to blocklist sites will be covered without having to be aware of alternate forms of persist. If this is sufficient, can we do this? Doesn't seem massively bad, especially if we add a global (hidden) pref to disable this for people who really want only visible cookies.

Honza: thanks for that. I think instead of calling IsChromeURI you might want to check the document's principal, IsCapabilityEnabled "UniversalBrowserWrite". That would allow any trusted XUL document to use persistence.
After you're happy with the patch you should ask for review, probably from Jonas Sicking (jonas@sicking.cc).

You should call NodePrincipal() (lives on nsINode) rather than getting the principal from the channel.

Backed out since this is likely the cause of a reftest failure:
<http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=Firefox/1207304616.1207306050.2695.gz#err0>
That test uses a xul document with persistence, so this seems like the one. :) Probably the reftest should be fixed, rather than this bug?

Backing this out did indeed clear the mac and windows failures (linux is still cycling as I type). Given the simplicity of the patch and the clearly deliberate disabling of persist for xul content, I suspect the test should be neutered or changed, but I'll defer to the experts here.
Jonas, you reviewed the patch, bz, you wrote the test, thoughts? :)

The test is explicitly testing that persistence works for a particular toolkit widget. It's testing a bug originally reported against chrome (as you can see if you read the bug corresponding to the test name). So the right thing to do here is probably to change that test to run against chrome, somehow.

The current test is about testing persistence of the selectedIndex in a tab box. So, have a chrome (mochi) test checking its value after reload should be enough. I will create such a test.

Does that new test fail if the patch for the relevant bug is backed out? I distinctly recall that my initial test looked like that and didn't actually test the bug because the property was out of sync with the display....

When the patch for this bug is backed out the new (fixed) test will pass either. The patch for this bug only disallows for foreign xul and all html pages use of the persistent attributes. As I understand.
The test (original and the new fixed one too) verifies whether the persistent attribute works for selectedIndex of tabboxes.

My backout accidentally reverted the reftest.list change without re-adding the removed files, so I relanded that part. All that needs to be relanded are the new/changed files when the test failure is addressed.

Hmm.. this won't be that easy. I added by hacking of layout/tools/reftest/jar.mn the resource file for the test to be in the chrome of the test framework. I get the following error:
Security Error: Content at file:///D:/mozilla/layout/reftests/bugs/
398289-1.html may not load or link to chrome://reftest/content/bugs/398289-resou

The path is correct. File resides in \_obj/dist/bin/chrome/reftest/content/bugs/. I am afraid we will need a chromereftest framework.

I'd say create a test that can be run manually to test your patch. File a bug on getting a chrome-ref-test framework (or expand the reftest framework to support chrome files). Stick your manual test into that bug.
That way we can for now know that your patch is correct. And later make sure it doesn't regress.

If I add the test html and ref html to a chrome (I hack the reftest chrome again) and I add to the test list line "== chrome://reftest/content/bugs/398289-1.html chrome://reftest/content/bugs/398289-1-ref.html" it almost works. With one exception. [Bug 371075](/show_bug.cgi?id=371075 "NEW - should reftest use CheckLoadURI?") added checking if the URL could be loaded by reftest framework. URLs are tested against the path to the test list (to the file URL) that doesn't allow load of any chrome.
I changed the test to check against the location of window of the test (chrome://reftest/content/reftest.xul) and then the framework works with chrome URLs in a list. But I am not sure we may change it this way, David, can you give an advise here please?

Could you explain the reftest.js changes?
Waldo might have some better ideas on how to this. Seem like maybe we might have a way in the manifest to load the files with chrome privs rather than having to give them chrome: URLs.

Nothing really springs to mind; we really should make reftest create its own profile which we could customize to make the source tree accessible for chrome: tests. It wouldn't be hard to do (I think there's a script in build/ to create profiles), but it would need to be done.

I created a script that creates new profile, adds privilege preferences to the pref file and runs the test list. Preferences are:
user\_pref("capability.principal.codebaseTrusted.p0.granted", "UniversalXPConnect UniversalBrowserRead UniversalBrowserWrite UniversalPreferencesRead UniversalPreferencesWrite UniversalFileRead");
user\_pref("capability.principal.codebaseTrusted.p0.id", "file://");
user\_pref("capability.principal.codebaseTrusted.p0.subjectName", "");
user\_pref("signed.applets.codebase\_principal\_support", true);
This still doesn't help - xul iframe in our test has not got access granted. I get:
"JavaScript error: chrome://global/content/bindings/dialog.xml, line 186: Permission denied to get property XPCComponents.classes"
The test perfectly works with my changes to the test framework. The reftest.js changes modifies the uri against we do the permission test. Before it were testing against URL of the test list file (maybe a real bug?), with my changes it test against the URL of the file test file.

I googled this and came across the following Mochitest documentation: <http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mochitest#How_can_I_get_around_the_error_.22Permission_denied_to_get_property_XPCComponents.classes.22.3F>. So, I guess one would need to include that line of JS in each test file in order for this approach to work.
Interestingly enough, that documentation suggests adding a hack to Mochitest that would essentially do what your aforementioned patch has done for reftest.

Current progress: I modified my script to use the same approach as mochitest to access the source/test files from chrome. There is no need to modify preferences and actually no need to have a profile. However, I still have this feature. It works on windows, but it will take additional time to port it to Mac OS and I don't have a way to test this on linux (don't have a linux machine). This script still needs the change in reftest.js.
If you agree this approach is correct then let me know please. Otherwise my first patch is probably sufficient, at least because we need to get this in ASAP (the patch fixing this real bug hangs only on a failing test for completely different bug).

So personally I think it's ok to check in this patch without automated tests, as long as we have manual tests that can be used to verify the fix. We can add automated tests once we have chrome-reftests or reftests-with-custom-profile.

The problem is not that \_this\_ patch can't be tested, but that other existing regression tests no longer work with this patch. So it's not verifying this fix that's worrisome, but preventing the other bugs from regressing...

This doesn't look right. You need to make sure to use the principal of the document. This looks like it'll use the principal of whatever javascript happen to be running when we end up in this function.

I thought it was wrong. However, using this code:
nsIPrincipal\* principal = GetPrincipal();
rv = principal->IsCapabilityEnabled(aCapabilityLabel, nsnull, &enabled);
also doesn't look right to me. When the second parameter (actually a hashtable where values are stored) is null the capability is always false. So, it cannot be set to true by user or any other preference. I don't know where to take the annotation of the document, there is no example in lxr.
However, the patch as would be with the snippet above disallows attribute persistence (fixes the bug).

> So, it cannot be set to true by user or any other preference.
That's correct, so it's actually equivalent to an IsSystemPrincipal check at the moment. The idea was that if we later create a way to associate expanded privileges with a principal (and not just a JSStackFrame), things here would Just Work.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2008-63

## User tracking via XUL persist attribute

Announced
December 16, 2008
Reporter
Hish
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.5

### Description

Security researcher **Hish** reported that
the `persist` attribute in XUL elements can be used to
store cookie-like information on a user's computer which could later
be read by a website. This creates a privacy issue for users who have
a non-standard cookie preference and wish to prevent sites from
setting cookies on their machine. Even with cookies turned off, this
issue could be used by a website to write persistent data in a user's
browser and track the user across browsing sessions. Additionally,
this issue could allow a website to bypass the limits normally placed
on cookie size and number.
