{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way multiple Anti-Virus (AV) software products handle and scan web pages, particularly HTML files. By prepending a malicious HTML file with an MZ header (used for executable files) and changing its extension (e.g., to .txt or removing the extension), the AV software can be tricked into not properly scanning the file, allowing malicious code to bypass detection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation of file types and formats.",
      "Failure to properly parse and scan files with unexpected headers and extensions.",
      "Reliance on file extension for file type identification.",
      "Lack of robust heuristic analysis."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows malicious web pages to bypass AV detection, potentially leading to compromise of a user's system by executing malicious scripts within the web browser (IE6 & IE7). This could result in various attacks, including remote buffer overflows as demonstrated by the included POC.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious web pages hosted on a server.",
      "Social engineering to trick users into visiting the malicious URL.",
     "The malicious HTML page is disguised by using a false extension or no extension. The attacker uploads the modified malicious file to a webserver."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to create and modify HTML files.",
      "Knowledge of the 'magic of magic byte' technique to add MZ headers to files.",
      "Ability to host files on a web server.",
      "Ability to deceive a user into accessing the malicious URL."
