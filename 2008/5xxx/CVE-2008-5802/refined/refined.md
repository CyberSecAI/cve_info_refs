```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the 'cat_id' parameter in the URL.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the application's database, potentially allowing them to extract sensitive data (user(), database()), modify data, or potentially gain further access to the underlying system.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the 'cat_id' parameter in the URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
