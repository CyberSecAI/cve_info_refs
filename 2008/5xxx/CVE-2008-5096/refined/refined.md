The provided content is a security bulletin from TYPO3, specifically **TYPO3-20080919-1**, which details multiple vulnerabilities in various third-party extensions. This information is relevant to CVE-2008-5096 since it addresses multiple SQL injection and arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities in TYPO3 extensions.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Several extensions suffer from SQL injection vulnerabilities. This means that user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or escaped before being used in SQL queries. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query, potentially extracting sensitive information or modifying data.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** One extension has an arbitrary code execution vulnerability, which means an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server. This vulnerability likely involves some form of unsafe handling of user-supplied data or files.
*   **Information Disclosure:** One extension has an information disclosure vulnerability which could lead to unintended access to information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Unsanitized user inputs leading to SQL Injection
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Vulnerability that allows execution of malicious code.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Allowing unauthorized access to information

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Data breaches: Attackers can access sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   Data manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Privilege escalation: In some cases, SQL injection can lead to the attacker gaining administrative access to the system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**
    *   Full control of the server: Attackers can execute system commands on the server leading to complete compromise.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based attacks:** All vulnerabilities are likely exploited via HTTP requests, targeting the vulnerable extensions within the TYPO3 CMS.
*   **Malicious input:** Attackers provide malicious input to the vulnerable extension's forms, parameters, or requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable TYPO3 instance.
*   **Basic understanding of web requests and SQL:** For SQL injection attacks, the attacker needs to understand how to manipulate SQL queries. For arbitrary code execution, they must have the knowledge of how to insert and trigger code execution.

**Specific Vulnerable Extensions:**

The following extensions were listed as vulnerable in the bulletin:

*   **auto BE User Registration (autobeuser):** SQL Injection (Uninstall recommended)
*   **Swigmore institute (cgswigmore):** SQL Injection (Updated version available)
*   **FE address edit for tt_address & direct mail (dmaddredit):** SQL Injection (Uninstall recommended)
*   **File List (file\_list):** Information disclosure (Uninstall recommended)
*   **HBook (h\_book):** Blind SQL Injection (Uninstall recommended)
*   **Secure Directory (kw\_secdir):** Arbitrary code execution (Updated version available)
*   **Simple Random Objects (mw\_random\_objects):** SQL Injection (Uninstall recommended)
*   **My quiz and poll (myquizpoll):** SQL Injection (Updated version available)
*   **Diocese of Portsmouth Church Search (pd\_churchsearch):** Blind SQL Injection (Updated version available)
*  **Random Prayer Version 2 (ste_prayer2):** SQL Injection (Updated version available)
*   **Another Backend Login (wrg\_anotherbelogin):** Blind SQL Injection (Updated version available)
