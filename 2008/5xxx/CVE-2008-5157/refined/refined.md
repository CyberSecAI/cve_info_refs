Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5157

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure creation of temporary files within the `tau` software package. Specifically, the `tau_cxx`, `tau_f90`, and `tau_cc` scripts create temporary files in the `/tmp` directory with predictable names (`/tmp/makefile.tau.*.#####`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Symlink Attack:** The primary vulnerability is a symlink attack. An attacker can create a symbolic link with the same name as a temporary file that the vulnerable scripts are going to create. When the script tries to write to the file, it will instead write to the location pointed to by the symlink.
*   **Predictable Temporary File Names:** The scripts generate temporary file names in a predictable manner which allows attackers to anticipate the name of the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A successful exploit allows a local user to overwrite arbitrary files on the system with the content of the temporary file that the vulnerable script writes. This could lead to a denial of service or allow a malicious user to replace system files or gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack:** The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have an account on the system.
*   **Symlink Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the vulnerable system.
*   **Write Access to /tmp:** The attacker needs write access to the /tmp directory (or at least to be able to create symlinks there).
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to create the symlink before the vulnerable script creates the temporary file.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects `tau` versions up to 2.16.4.
* The fix involves preventing files from being overwritten via the symlink attack, and in later versions, the problematic scripts were removed altogether since they were not useful.
* The vulnerability is considered 'serious' in Debian, and was initially marked as 'important'.
* The initial fix in version 2.16.4-1.3 was incomplete, thus requiring a later fix in version 2.17.3.1.dfsg-4.
