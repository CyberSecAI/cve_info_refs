  "CVE-2008-5811": {
    "is_related": true,
    "summary": "The Joomla! Component PAX Gallery 0.1 is vulnerable to blind SQL injection.",
    "details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The component does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'gid' parameter when handling requests.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Blind SQL Injection"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database through the vulnerable 'gid' parameter, allowing for potential unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of data, or complete compromise of the application and potentially the server.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable URL, specifically by manipulating the 'gid' parameter."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, no prior authentication or specific privileges are required.",
         "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present in the com_paxgallery component. The attacker can use SQL injection techniques, such as substring and ascii functions to extract data from the database in a blind fashion. The example exploit and demo URLs shows a basic payload for the 'gid' parameter."
