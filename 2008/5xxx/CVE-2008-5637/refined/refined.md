Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL Injection flaw in the `blog.asp` file of ParsBlogger. The `wr` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `wr` parameter in the `blog.asp` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to read sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  Through SQL Injection, attackers may gain elevated access by manipulating database queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request with a crafted `wr` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL to craft the injection payload.

**Exploit Example:**
The exploit example given in the content is:
```
site.ir/blog.asp?wr=-5+union+all+select+1,2,concat(username,0x3a,password),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13+from+writer--
```
This example demonstrates how to use a `UNION` SQL injection technique to extract usernames and passwords from the `writer` table.

The exploit utilizes a crafted SQL query to retrieve database information by exploiting the vulnerable `wr` parameter in `blog.asp`.
