{
  "CVE-2008-5666": {
    "Description": "WinFTP Server 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack via the PASV mode. By repeatedly sending PASV commands, followed by a NLST command, an attacker can cause the server to become unresponsive when trying to send data.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way WinFTP Server handles PASV mode connections. It appears the server does not properly manage the resources allocated for these passive connections and subsequent data transfers, causing exhaustion upon repeated requests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper resource management for passive connections",
      "Lack of proper rate-limiting or connection management"
    ],
     "Impact": "Denial of service. The server becomes unresponsive to further connections and data transfer requests.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a series of specific FTP commands (USER, PASS, PASV, NLST, QUIT)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Network connectivity to the vulnerable server",
      "Ability to send FTP commands"
    ],
    "Additional Details": "The exploit code provided sends the necessary FTP commands, including 'PASV' and 'NLST -1', repeatedly to cause the denial of service. The vulnerability can be triggered even with anonymous login."
