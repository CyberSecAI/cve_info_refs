Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in the `password_recovery.php` file of NetCat CMS version 3.12. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Blind SQL injection: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query string, which is then executed by the database server. Due to the blind nature, the attacker cannot see the query results directly, but can infer the results based on the server's response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, specifically user logins and password hashes.
- The attacker can use the extracted information to gain unauthorized access to the NetCat CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker sends specially crafted HTTP GET requests to `modules/auth/password_recovery.php` with a modified query string containing SQL injection code.
- The vulnerability is exploited through the `http_connect()` function in the provided exploit code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable NetCat CMS server.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication on the system.
- The attacker needs to know or be able to guess/enumerate the user IDs to be able to extract the usernames and password hashes.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code automates the process of extracting the username and password hash by using the blind SQL injection. It iterates through characters and positions to extract the data by checking the response to each crafted request.
- The exploit targets the `Login` and `Password` columns within the `USER` table.
- The exploit utilizes the `ASCII`, `lower`, `SUBSTRING` and `limit` SQL functions in the SQL injection payload to extract data character by character.

This information is consistent with the identified CVE.
