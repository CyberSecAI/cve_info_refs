# VLC Media Player < 0.9.6 .RT File Buffer Overflow (Stack Based)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Exploit by SkD <skdrat@hotmail.com>
#
# This should work on a fully up-to-date Windows XP SP3. If you want it to work
# on your OS version, just find a "jmp esp" address in one of the dlls loaded
# with VLC :).
# Have fun.  Remember that VLC will open the file .rt automatically with a video
# of the same name (example: s.mov with s.rt in the same folder).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# VLC: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200812-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities in VLC may lead to the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/vlc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.8a** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.8a** |

### Background

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

### Description

Tobias Klein reported the following vulnerabilities:

* A
  stack-based buffer overflow when processing CUE image files in
  modules/access/vcd/cdrom.c (CVE-2008-5032).
* A stack-based
  buffer overflow when processing RealText (.rt) subtitle files in the
  ParseRealText() function in modules/demux/subtitle.c
  (CVE-2008-5036).
* An integer overflow when processing RealMedia
  (.rm) files in the ReadRealIndex() function in real.c in the Real
  demuxer plugin, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2008-5276).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted CUE
image file, RealMedia file or RealText subtitle file, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.9.8a"
```

Hash: SHA1
Advisory: VLC media player RealText Processing Stack Overflow
Vulnerability
Advisory ID: TKADV2008-011
Revision: 1.1
Release Date: 2008/11/05
Last Modified: 2008/12/20
Date Reported: 2008/11/03
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: VLC media player < 0.9.6
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Vendor URL: http://www.videolan.org/
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
CVE-ID: CVE-2008-5036
Patch development time: 2 days
======================
Vulnerability details:
======================
The VLC media player contains a stack overflow vulnerability while parsing
malformed RealText (rt) subtitle files. The vulnerability can be trivially
exploited by a (remote) attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context
of VLC media player.
VLC handles subtitles automatically. It just checks the presence of a
subtitle file with the same name of the loaded video. If such a subtitle
file is found, VLC loads and parses the file.
==================
Technical Details:
==================
Source code file: modules\demux\subtitle.c
[...]
1843 static int ParseRealText( demux\_t \*p\_demux, subtitle\_t \*p\_subtitle,
int i\_idx )
1844 {
1845 VLC\_UNUSED( i\_idx );
1846 demux\_sys\_t \*p\_sys = p\_demux->p\_sys;
1847 text\_t \*txt = &p\_sys->txt;
1848 char \*psz\_text = NULL;
1849 [1] char psz\_end[12]= "", psz\_begin[12] = "";
1850
1851 for( ;; )
1852 {
1853 int h1 = 0, m1 = 0, s1 = 0, f1 = 0;
1854 int h2 = 0, m2 = 0, s2 = 0, f2 = 0;
1855 const char \*s = TextGetLine( txt );
1856 free( psz\_text );
1857
1858 if( !s )
1859 return VLC\_EGENERIC;
1860
1861 psz\_text = malloc( strlen( s ) + 1 );
1862 if( !psz\_text )
1863 return VLC\_ENOMEM;
1864
1865 /\* Find the good begining. This removes extra spaces at the
1866 beginning of the line.\*/
1867 char \*psz\_temp = strcasestr( s, "]%[^\n\r]",
1873 psz\_begin, psz\_end, psz\_text) != 3 ) &&
1874 /\* Line has begin and no end \*/
1875 [3] ( sscanf( psz\_temp,
1876 "<%\*[t|T]ime
%\*[b|B]egin=\"%[^\"]\"%\*[^>]%[^\n\r]",
1877 psz\_begin, psz\_text ) != 2) )
1878 /\* Line is not recognized \*/
1879 {
1880 continue;
1881 }
[...]
[1] The stack buffers "psz\_end" and "psz\_begin" can be overflowed
[2] The sscanf() function reads its input from a user controlled character
string pointed to by "psz\_temp". The user controlled data gets stored
in the stack buffers "psz\_end" and "psz\_begin" without any bounds
checking. This leads to a straight stack overflow that can be trivially
exploited by a (remote) attacker to execute arbitrary code in the
context of VLC.

# Security Advisory 0810

```

Summary           : Buffer overflows in VLC RealText and CUE demuxers
Date              : November 2008
Affected versions : VLC media player 0.9.5 down to 0.5.0
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-0810
CVE reference     : CVE-2008-5032, CVE-2008-5036

```
## Details

When parsing the header of an invalid CUE image file
or an invalid RealText subtitle file,
stack-based buffer overflows might occur.

## Impact

If successful,
a malicious third party could trigger execution of arbitrary code
within the context of the VLC media player.

## Threat mitigation

Exploitation of this issue requires the user
to explicitly open a specially crafted file.

## Workarounds

The user should refrain from opening files from untrusted third parties
or accessing untrusted remote sites (or disable the VLC browser plugins),
until the patch is applied.

Alternatively, the VCD and Subtitles plugins
(`libvcd_plugin.*` and `libsubtitle_plugin.*`)
can be removed manually from the VLC plugin installation directory.
However, this will **prevent use of subtitle files**
and Video CD altogether.

## Solution

VLC media player 0.9.6 addresses this issue.
Patches for older versions are available
from the official VLC source code repository 0.9-bugfix branch.

## Credits

These vulnerabilities were reported by Tobias Klein.

Could you split that up into two CVE ids? I ask because the
realtext issue doesn't affect versions < 0.9.x which is the
case for the version we have in Debian so I can not use a
fixed version + not-affected for one CVE id in our security
tracker.

Kind regards
Nico

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Message-Id: <200811052317.11277.rem@videolan.org>
Date: Wed, 5 Nov 2008 23:17:11 +0200
From: Rémi Denis-Courmont <rem@...eolan.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: VideoLAN security advisory 0810

Summary           : Buffer overflows in VLC RealText and CUE demuxers
Date              : November 2008
Affected versions : VLC media player 0.9.5 down to 0.5.0
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-0810
CVE reference     : None yet.

- Details -

When parsing the header of an invalid CUE image file or an invalid RealText
subtitle file, stack-based buffer overflows might occur.

- Impact -

If successful, a malicious third party could trigger execution of arbitrary
code within the context of the VLC media player.

- Threat mitigation -

Exploitation of this issue requires the user to explicitly open a specially
crafted file.

- Workarounds -

The user should refrain from opening files from untrusted third parties or
accessing untrusted remote sites (or disable the VLC browser plugins), until
the patch is applied.
Alternatively, the VCD and Subtitles plugins (libvcd_plugin.* and
libsubtitle_plugin.*) can be removed manually from the VLC plugin
installation directory. However, this will prevent use of subtitle files and
Video CD altogether.

- Solution -

VLC media player 0.9.6 addresses this issue. Patches for older versions are
available from the official VLC source code repository 0.9-bugfix branch.

- Credits -

These vulnerabilities were reported by Tobias Klein.
