Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5636:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `cate.php` file of the Lito Lite CMS. Specifically, the `cid` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to:
    - Retrieve sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords.
    - Modify or delete data in the database.
    - Potentially gain further control over the server, depending on the database user's permissions and server configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `cate.php` file, specifically the `cid` parameter.
- A remote attacker can craft a malicious URL containing SQL injection payloads within the `cid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Lito Lite CMS application.
- No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit code provided demonstrates the injection technique:

```
$target."/cate.php?cid=1%27%20and%201=2%20union%20select 1,2,3,concat(0x3a3a3a,username,0x3a3a,password,0x3a3a3a),5,6,7,8,9,10%20from%20mx_user%20limit%201%20offset%20".$start."--+and+1=1"
```

This crafted URL injects SQL code to extract usernames and passwords from the `mx_user` table.  The `offset` parameter is used to retrieve multiple rows of data.
The `magic_quotes_gpc` setting needs to be off for the exploit to work.

**Additional notes:**
- The exploit code provided is written in Perl.
- The Exploit-DB entry verifies the vulnerability.
