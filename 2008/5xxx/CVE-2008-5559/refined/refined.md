Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-5559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection within the `sendcard.cfm` script of the PostEcards application. This is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input (`cid` parameter) when constructing SQL queries.
*   **Database Disclosure:**  The application's database file (`postcards.mdb`) is publicly accessible, leading to database disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `cid` parameter in `sendcard.cfm` is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query, which could be used to extract sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The direct access to the database file (`postcards.mdb`) allows for unauthorized viewing and downloading of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive user data (usernames, passwords, etc.) from the database via SQL injection.
*   **Database Exposure:** Attackers can directly download the database file containing sensitive information via exposed path.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:**  With the user credentials, attackers may be able to gain administrative access and further compromise the web server or other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET requests:** Vulnerable URLs are accessed through HTTP GET requests.
*   **Manipulation of URL parameters:** Exploitation is achieved by manipulating the `cid` parameter in the `sendcard.cfm` URL with SQL injection payloads.
*   **Direct access to database file:** The database file can be accessed directly via a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:**  The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Basic understanding of SQL injection:**  The attacker should have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft appropriate injection payloads.
*   **Basic understanding of database access:** The attacker should be able to access and download a database if path is provided

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit examples provided demonstrate the retrieval of username and password data via SQL injection.
*   The vulnerable application is identified as "PostEcards".
*   The identified exploit includes a live demo link that points to an instance of the vulnerable application.
*   The vulnerability was reported by "AlpHaNiX".
*   The exploit-db entry also mentions the associated CVE-2008-5560.
