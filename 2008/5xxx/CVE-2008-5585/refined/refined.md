```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses unsanitized user-supplied input in include statements. Specifically, the `phpbb_root_path` parameter is used directly within `include()` and `require_once()` functions, allowing for the inclusion of arbitrary remote files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, leading to the execution of malicious code on the server. This could result in complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request by manipulating the `phpbb_root_path` parameter in the URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."
