Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5293:

**Summary:**
CVE-2008-5293 is a blind SQL injection vulnerability found in WebStudio eHotel. The vulnerability is located in the `pageid` parameter of the application's URL.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `pageid` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection. This means that the attacker does not see the results of their injected queries directly. Instead, they must infer the results based on the application's behavior (e.g., timing differences, response codes).
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not sanitize or validate user input before using it in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to access sensitive data stored in the database. This could include user credentials, personal information, financial data, or other confidential information.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database, potentially disrupting the application or causing data integrity issues.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database privileges, an attacker might be able to escalate their privileges and gain control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `pageid` parameter of the HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to understand blind SQL injection techniques to craft appropriate payloads to extract information.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit example demonstrates how a blind SQL injection is performed:
- The attacker manipulates the `pageid` parameter by injecting SQL statements with `AND` and `substring` operators to check for specific values of the database version.
- For example:
    - `http://www.webstudioehotel.com/index.php?pageid=50+and+substring(@@version,1,1)=3` would return true if the first character of database version is 3.
    - `http://www.webstudioehotel.com/index.php?pageid=50+and+substring(@@version,1,1)=4` would return false if the first character of database version is not 4.
- By observing the application's response to different injected queries, an attacker can deduce information about the database structure and its content.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit was published on November 25, 2008.
- The vulnerable application is "WebStudio eHotel".
- The vulnerability affects a `PHP` based application.
- The exploit-db entry also provides dorks (`"Powered by WebStudio eHotel"`) that can be used to locate vulnerable installations using search engines.
