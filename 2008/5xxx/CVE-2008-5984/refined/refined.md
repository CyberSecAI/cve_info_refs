{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2008-5984",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the insertion of the current working directory (cwd) at the beginning of the Python module search path by the `PySys_SetArgv` function in Python versions prior to 2.6.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default search path for Python modules.",
      "Use of current working directory as part of the Python module search path."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious Python file with the same name as an imported module in the current working directory when running a vulnerable application.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation requires a local user to create a malicious Python file in the current working directory of a vulnerable application.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to write files to the filesystem and execute vulnerable applications that use the Python interpreter.",
        "Affected applications": [
      "epiphany",
      "csound",
      "dia",
      "eog",
      "gedit",
      "xchat",
      "vim",
      "nautilus-python",
      "Gnumeric"
    ],
        "More details": "The issue is related to how `PySys_SetArgv` function in Python sets the `sys.path`. This function inserts an empty string '' at the beginning of `sys.path`. This makes Python look for modules in the current working directory first before any other directory in the system. If an attacker places a malicious python module in the same directory as where the vulnerable application is being run, the malicious module would be loaded instead of the original."
