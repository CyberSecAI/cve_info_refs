Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5957

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection flaw in the `mydyngallery` component for Joomla. Specifically, the `directory` parameter in the URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `directory` parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  **Database access:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
-   **Data Breach:** The attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords, as shown in the provided exploit example which extracts `username` and `password` from the `jos_users` table.
- **Data Modification:** The attacker can modify or delete data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a specifically crafted `directory` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla installation. No special access to the server is required.
- Knowledge of SQL syntax and Joomla's database schema is beneficial to craft effective attacks.

**Exploit Code:**
```
http://Site/[joomla_path]/index.php?option=com_mydyngallery&directory=zzz'+union+select+0,1,2,concat(0x3C703E,username,0x7c,password,0x3C2F703E),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31+from+jos_users/*
```
This exploit example uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `jos_users` table, specifically concatenating the `username` and `password` fields.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a DORK `inurl:option=com_mydyngallery` which can be used to find vulnerable Joomla websites via search engines.
- The vulnerable application is the `mydyngallery` component for Joomla version 1.4.2
