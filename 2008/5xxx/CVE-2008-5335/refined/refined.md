```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the messages.php file of PHP-Fusion 7.00.1.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'subject' parameter of a message, which allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.
- Lack of input validation: The application fails to validate the data being passed into the SQL query.
- The exploit specifically requires 'magic_quotes' to be off.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary SQL commands can be executed on the database server.
- This could lead to data theft, modification, or deletion.
- In some instances, it could lead to full control of the database server and, therefore, the application.
- The provided exploit code shows how to potentially read files from the server.

Attack vectors:
- Remote attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable "messages.php" file.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to have a valid login and password for the PHP-Fusion application to get the cookies.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests.
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft the injection.
- The target server needs to have 'magic_quotes' turned off for the attack to succeed.
