Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5216

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an insecure MySQL query within the `category_list.php` script of ZeusCart.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection.  The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `cid` parameter of `category_list.php`, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary MySQL Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database.
- **Data Breach:** This allows the attacker to potentially read, modify, or delete data stored within the database. As demonstrated in the exploit, an attacker can retrieve admin credentials stored in plain text.
- **Full Compromise:** Successful SQL injection can lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server depending on database privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `category_list.php` script.
- **`cid` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `cid`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting ZeusCart.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
- **Basic Web Request Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to craft web requests with malicious URL parameters.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit example demonstrates how an attacker can use a crafted URL to retrieve admin credentials:
  `http://site.com/category_list.php?cid=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/CONCAT(user_name,char(58),password),2/**/FROM/**/admin/*`

**Additional Information:**
- The passwords are stored in plaintext in the database. This is a separate weakness that exacerbates the impact of SQL injection.
- The vendor has not been notified.
- The vulnerability affects ZeusCart version 2.0 and prior.
