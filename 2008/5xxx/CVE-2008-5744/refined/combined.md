Affected files are indeed part of the zaptel SRPM, but according to the build logs, they are not built or shipped in any of the (binary) RPMS.  The code does not seem to be part of the upstream kernel, and Fedora does no longer permit shipping kernel modules packages.  Can anyone clarify this?  This looks like notabug for Fedora.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=475446#c7)  Jeffrey C. Ollie    2009-01-20 18:37:59 UTC  ``` Yes, Fedora only ships the userspace libraries.  The zaptel/dadhi modules are not in the upstream kernel and Fedora prohibits kernel modules shipped outside of the kernel RPM.  I'd agree this is notabug.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=475446#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-20 18:44:56 UTC  ``` Jeffrey, thanks for quick confirmation!  Closing.   ``` |  |

Message-Id: <1229693532.19341.23.camel@iankko.englab.brq.redhat.com>

Subject: CVE Request - Incomplete dahdi/zaptel tor2.c patch for
	CVE-2008-5396

Hello Steve,

  Eugene Teo has discovered the tor2 upstream
patch for CVE-2008-5396 was incomplete.

<http://bugs.digium.com/file_download.php?file_id=20796&type=bug>

We were checking if lc->sync is in range of 0-63
kernel/tor2.c:#define MAX_TOR_CARDS 64, but then
lately in the code we used:

zaptel/kernel/tor2.c:

    216         /* if a sync src, put it in the proper place */
    217         if (lc->sync) {
    218                 p->tor->syncs[lc->sync - 1] = span->spanno;
    219                 p->tor->psyncs[lc->sync - 1] = p->span + 1;
    220         }

The problem is 'syncs/psyncs' is defined as array with only 4 items (from zaptel/kernel/tor2.c)

     79 struct tor2 {
     80         /* This structure exists one per card */
     81         struct pci_dev *pci;            /* Pointer to PCI device */
     82         int num;                        /* Which card we are */
     83         int syncsrc;                    /* active sync source */
     84         int syncs[SPANS_PER_CARD];      /* sync sources */
     85         int psyncs[SPANS_PER_CARD];     /* span-relative sync sources */

where 'SPANS_PER_CARD' is defined as:
tor2.c:#define SPANS_PER_CARD  4

so the array index would overflow.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
