Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5215:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `profil.php` script. Specifically, the `link` parameter in the URL is not sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS in the `calendrier.php` script. The `mois` and `annee` parameters in the URL are not sanitized before being included in the HTML output, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The `profil.php` script is susceptible to SQL injection.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79):** The `calendrier.php` script is susceptible to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can use SQL injection to:
    *   Extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials (usernames and passwords).
    *   Modify data in the database.
    *   Potentially gain control over the database server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker can use XSS to:
    *   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    *   Steal user session cookies, potentially leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious SQL payload in the `link` parameter of `profil.php`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `mois` and `annee` parameters of `calendrier.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No special privileges on the server side are required to exploit these vulnerabilities. The attacker just needs to craft the malicious requests.

**Additional Details (From Exploit-DB content):**

*   The vulnerable application is ClanLite V2.
*   Exploit examples for both vulnerabilities are given:
    *   SQL injection payload using `UNION SELECT` to extract user credentials from the `clanlite_user` table.
    *   XSS payload injecting JavaScript to display the document's cookie using an `alert()` function.
*   Dorks to locate vulnerable sites are provided.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by ZoRLu.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on May 12, 2008

**Summary:**

CVE-2008-5215 is related to a vulnerability in ClanLite V2 which allows remote attackers to perform SQL Injection and Cross Site Scripting attacks by crafting malicious URLs.
