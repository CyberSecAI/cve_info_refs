Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5992

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to **multiple SQL injection flaws** in the `diger.php` and `sayfalar.php` files of the Jetik Emlak ESA 2.0 System Script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `KayitNo` parameter in `diger.php` and `sayfalar.php`, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Access:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete data.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The exploit examples provided show how an attacker can extract sensitive database information like the user, database name, and version, using `UNION SELECT` and `concat` SQL statements.
*   **Potential System Compromise:** In severe cases, successful SQL injection may lead to complete system compromise depending on the database user privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP GET requests to `diger.php` and `sayfalar.php` with malicious SQL code injected into the `KayitNo` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic SQL knowledge:** The attacker should have basic knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit examples illustrate how an attacker can craft malicious URLs to exploit the SQL injection.

```
http://localhost/script_path/diger.php?KayitNo=[SQL]
http://localhost/script_path/sayfalar.php?KayitNo=[SQL]

[SQL]= -99999999+union+select+null,null,concat(user(),0x3a,database(),0x3a,version()),null,null/*
```

The `[SQL]` portion of the URL shows the injected SQL payload which uses:
   - A negative integer (`-99999999`) is likely used to ensure that no existing data is returned before the UNION SELECT query is executed.
    - `union select`: To append the attacker's SQL query to the original one.
    - `null,null`: Placeholders for original queryâ€™s column selection
    - `concat(user(),0x3a,database(),0x3a,version())`: To concatenate database user, name, and version with a colon separator.
    -  `null, null`: Again, placeholders for remaining columns to match original column selection in the vulnerable query.
    - `/*`: To comment out any remaining parts of the original query.
