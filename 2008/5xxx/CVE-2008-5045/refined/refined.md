Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5045:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap overflow in FTP Now version 2.6 server when handling long responses. Specifically, the server breaks responses into buffers either of length 1024 or at '\r\n'. Each buffer is appended with a null byte (`\x00`) without proper bounds checking. If a response has exactly 1024 characters, the appended null byte overwrites the heap.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap overflow due to missing bounds check when appending a null byte to a response buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The overflow leads to a crash of the FTP server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted FTP commands that elicit a 1024-character response from the server.
- The provided Perl script exploits this by sending a sequence of commands such as "USER", "PASS", "syst", "CWD", "PWD" or others that trigger the vulnerable response construction path, forcing a 1024 character response with a final \r\n

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server.
- No special privileges are needed for the exploit, it can be performed remotely.
