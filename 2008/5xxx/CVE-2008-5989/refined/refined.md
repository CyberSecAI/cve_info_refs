```
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization in the `defs.php` script. Specifically, the script directly includes a file based on the value of the `l` parameter in the GET request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP files from the server. This allows the attacker to potentially read sensitive files, execute arbitrary code on the server and compromise the application and/or server.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `defs.php` with a malicious `l` parameter.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and needs knowledge of the file system structure in order to craft the malicious file paths for inclusion."
