**Summary of CVE-2008-5027:**

The vulnerability in Nagios allows a low-privileged, authenticated user to bypass authorization checks. By crafting a custom form or using a browser addon, an attacker can submit unauthorized commands to the Nagios process. These commands are then executed with the privileges of the Nagios process, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary programs on the Nagios server.
