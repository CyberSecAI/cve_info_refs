Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5930

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `blog_comments.asp` file within the "ASPIred2Blog" application.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application suffers from **SQL Injection (SQLi)** vulnerability. It also allows **Direct Directory (DD) access** which can lead to file disclosure.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This could compromise the entire database.
    *   **File Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive files such as the `blog.mdb` database which may contain sensitive user information or application secrets.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The `BlogID` parameter in the `blog_comments.asp` script is vulnerable to SQL injection, using a specially crafted URL. Specifically, the vector is `http://site.com/[Path]/admin/blog_comments.asp?BlogID='[SQL]`
    *   **File Disclosure:** Direct access to `http://site.com/[Path]/admin/blog.mdb` allows an attacker to download the database.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, meaning they can be on the same network or remote.
    *   The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit-db entry also lists **CVE-2008-5931**, however, that CVE is not present in the official CVE database, this suggests this may be a misattribution.
*   The "ASPIred2Blog" application is identified, with a link to the vendor's site ([http://thenetguys.us/Home/Blog.asp](http://thenetguys.us/Home/Blog.asp)). This helps with identification and reproduction of the issue.
*   The exploit-db entry clearly states the vulnerability type as "SQL,DD" with descriptions of both issues.
*   The entry also links to a vulnerable victim site at http://thenetguys.us/ASPired2/Blog/index.asp, for verification.
*   The vulnerability is present in the application's admin panel which is often not as well protected.
