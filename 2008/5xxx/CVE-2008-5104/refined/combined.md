# USN-670-1: VMBuilder vulnerability

13 November 2008

VMBuilder vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [shadow](/security/cves?package=shadow) -
* [vm-builder](/security/cves?package=vm-builder) -

## Details

Mathias Gug discovered that vm-builder improperly set the root

password when creating virtual machines. An attacker could exploit

this to gain root privileges to the virtual machine by using a

predictable password.

This vulnerability only affects virtual machines created with

vm-builder under Ubuntu 8.10, and does not affect native Ubuntu

installations. An update was made to the shadow package to detect

vulnerable systems and disable password authentication for the

root account. Vulnerable virtual machines which an attacker has

access to should be considered compromised, and appropriate actions

taken to secure the machine.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [passwd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/shadow)
  -
  [1:4.1.1-1ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/shadow/1%3A4.1.1-1ubuntu1.1)
* [python-vm-builder](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/vm-builder)
  -
  [0.9-0ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/vm-builder/0.9-0ubuntu3.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [passwd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/shadow)
  -
  [1:4.0.18.2-1ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/shadow/1%3A4.0.18.2-1ubuntu2.1)

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [passwd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/shadow)
  -
  [1:4.0.18.1-9ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/shadow/1%3A4.0.18.1-9ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [passwd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/shadow)
  -
  [1:4.0.13-7ubuntu3.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/shadow/1%3A4.0.13-7ubuntu3.3)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

Mathiaz reported that vm created for ec2 could be logged on to the root account using ! as a password

It was later verified that this problem could be reproduced on any vm generated by python-vm-builder and some version of ubuntu-vm-builder.

Security fix for uvb in hardy fixed this but was later on reverted in the version in -proposed

Test:

Â Create a vm using "sudo vmbuilder kvm ubuntu --addpkg openssh-server"

Â Start the VM

Â Log in using ssh root@vm with password !

This fix breaks logging into our OpenVZ and Linux-VServer virtual machines created from debootstrapped templates. The routine by which you check whether the root login should be disabled is wrong:

if printf '!\0' | unix\_chkpwd root nullok ; then

Â Â echo 'root:!' | chpasswd -e

fi

This should become:

if printf '!\0' | unix\_chkpwd root nonull ; then

Â Â echo 'root:!' | chpasswd -e

fi

This bug will affect everybody who has "\*" as their root password, hence not using password, hence probably exclusively using SSH keys or something such. This should have been tested better before releasing a package that will lock many people out of their template-created machines (virtual or not).

A disabled empty root password (ie '\*' in /etc/shadow) works fine. Eg, using the below 'test.sh' script:

#!/bin/sh -e

for i in nullok nonull ; do

Â Â Â Â echo -n "$i: "

Â Â Â Â if printf '!\0' | unix\_chkpwd root $i ; then

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â echo "matched"

Â Â Â Â else

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â echo "did not match"

Â Â Â Â fi

done

$ sudo head -1 /etc/shadow

root:\*:14215:0:99999:7:::

$ sudo ./test.sh

nullok: did not match

nonull: did not match

What will match with nullok but not nonull is an enabled empty root password:

$ sudo head -1 /etc/shadow

root::14215:0:99999:7:::

Of course, an enabled empty root password allows passwordless root login via ssh and the console which is not at all needed for ssh keys logins.

Hi Jamie,

Firstly, I'm curious with what sshd\_config settings does sshd allow you to connect having such root line in /etc/shadow without supplying password.

Because even if I supply this config (neither of which I use in practice):

PermitRootLogin yes

PasswordAuthentication yes

I still can't login as root with empty password via SSH.

Secondly, while my original suggestion was wrong and nonull or nullok is not the main problem (it's just a coincidence that using nonull helps in my case), when you're disabling root login like this (exclamation mark in the password field, which has a special meaning of locking the account), do you realize you disable root login by SSH keys as well? It would have been much better to replace with an asterisk which achieves what you need to do and does not lock other people out.

/etc/shadow

1. I should have said "an enabled empty root password makes possible passwordless root login via ssh and the console". In other words, /etc/securetty and /etc/pam.d/common-auth need to be (mis)configured.

2. ssh public key logins are not disabled by the use of '!'. Eg:

/etc/shadow

root:!:14196:0:99999:7:::

/var/log/auth.log

Dec 15 18:17:59 sec-intrepid-amd64 sshd[5654]: Accepted publickey for root from 192.168.122.1 port 43391 ssh2

sshd\_config has:

1. OK

2. I may not know enough detail here, but why would it then be that root password '!' prevents me from logging with SSH key, but root password of '\*' allows me to do so? I was under impression that '!' in /etc/shadow password field is used to disable logins for that account entirely.

Part of the reason there's been a problem here is that the root user is initially set up by base-passwd as follows:

root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

I don't think the blank password is defensible in this day and age, and will change this. I wouldn't like to backport this to Intrepid immediately, though - I think it could bear a bit of shaking out just in case there are unexpected consequences.

This bug was fixed in the package base-passwd - 3.5.21

---------------

base-passwd (3.5.21) unstable; urgency=low

\* Set up the root user without a password by default, rather than giving

Â Â Â Â it an empty password. In this day and age the latter is not really a

Â Â Â Â defensible default (LP: [#296841](/bugs/296841)).

Â Â \* Update description of dip group, based on a suggestion by Osamu Aoki

Â Â Â Â (closes: #512938).

base-passwd (3.5.20) unstable; urgency=medium

\* Document that the staff group is typically root-equivalent (thanks, Guy

Â Â Â Â Hulbert).

Intrepid Ibex reached end-of-life on 30 April 2010 so I am closing the

report. The bug has been fixed in newer releases of Ubuntu.

I respectfully disagree with Jamie Strandboge regarding his statement: "ssh public key logins are not disabled by the use of '!'."

OpenSSH, when \*not\* relying on PAM for account checking (ie "UsePAM no"), will itself consider an account "locked" if the user's password field in the shadow file is prefixed with "!". See <http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-ssh/openssh.git/tree/auth.c?id=ce470e3bc0e39e71be0dbb809e29621466ac2bac#n139> and <http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-ssh/openssh.git/tree/configure.ac?id=ce470e3bc0e39e71be0dbb809e29621466ac2bac#n770> .

You can clearly see in your example that you were using PAM (though the log file explicitly shows that sshd was using PAM for session processing, that implicitly reveals that sshd was using PAM also for account processing as both are used when "UsePAM yes"). When sshd uses PAM for account processing, PAM does not regard the exclamation mark or asterisks (ie "!" or "\*") as locking the account and PAM does not prevent the SSH session from proceeding as OpenSSH does when performing accounting checking itself.

I found this bug report when searching the internet for 'ssh "User root not allowed because account is locked"' and through the tip that "!" and "\*" are sometimes treatly differently in regard to OpenSSH, I was able to figure out the difference in detail.
