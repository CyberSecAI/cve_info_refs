Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2008-5104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `vm-builder` tool was improperly setting the root password when creating virtual machines. Specifically, it was setting a default password of "!" for the root account.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable Password:** The use of a default, easily guessable password ("!") for the root account on virtual machines created by `vm-builder`.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The `vm-builder` tool did not properly handle the setting of the root password during VM creation, leading to a security vulnerability.
- **Incorrectly disabled root password:** The fix to the problem initially locked the root account instead of just disabling password login for the root user via an asterisk '\*' in the password field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Root Access:** An attacker could exploit the predictable password to gain root privileges on the virtual machine.
- **Compromised Virtual Machines:** Virtual machines created using the vulnerable `vm-builder` are considered compromised if an attacker has access to them.
- **Unauthorized access** Using the default password, an attacker could access the virtual machine without proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access (SSH):** An attacker could attempt to log into the virtual machine remotely using SSH with the default password "!" for the root account.
- **Console Access:** An attacker could log into the virtual machine locally with the default password "!" for the root account if console access is available.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network or console access to the virtual machine to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be aware of the default password for root set by vulnerable versions of `vm-builder`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affected virtual machines created by `vm-builder` under Ubuntu 8.10 and possibly other versions.
- The vulnerability does not affect native Ubuntu installations.
- The fix involved changes to the `shadow` package to disable password authentication for the root account on vulnerable systems.
- The `vm-builder` package was also updated to not set this insecure default password.
- The original fix was later found to cause problems for users relying on SSH keys for root login when not using PAM, because the exclamation point "!" in the password field disables login for that account entirely in that scenario. However this was not considered to be the standard way to configure SSH for root login.
