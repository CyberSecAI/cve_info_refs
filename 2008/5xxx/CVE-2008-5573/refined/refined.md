Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5573

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the authentication mechanism of Poll Pro 2.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries through user-supplied input.
- **Authentication Bypass:** By exploiting the SQL injection flaw, an attacker can bypass the authentication process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application's administrative interface or other protected areas.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface by manipulating login credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access before launching the attack.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses the following SQL injection payload in the username and password fields during login:
  - `username: ' or '1'='1`
  - `password: ' or '1'='1`
- This payload is used to bypass authentication because the resulting SQL query will always evaluate to true due to the injected condition.
