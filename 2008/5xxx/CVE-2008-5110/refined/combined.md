How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Syslog-ng: Chroot escape — GLSA **200907-10**

Syslog-ng does not properly initialize its chroot jail allowing for an
escape if a separate vulnerability in Syslog-ng is exploited.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/syslog-ng** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.1.3** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.0.10**>= **2.1.3** |

### Background

Syslog-ng is a flexible and scalable system logger.

### Description

Florian Grandel reported that Syslog-ng does not call chdir() before
chroot() which leads to an inherited file descriptor to the current
working directory.

### Impact

A local attacker might exploit a separate vulnerability in Syslog-ng
and use this vulnerability to escape the chroot jail.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Syslog-ng 2.0 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/syslog-ng-2.0.10"
```

All Syslog-ng 2.1 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/syslog-ng-2.1.3"
```

| [Description](#c0)  stupendoussteve    2008-11-17 22:04:14 UTC  ``` Syslog-ng does not call chdir() before chroot() which may allow the application to break out of a chroot jail.  CVE is new and has not yet been uploaded.  Ref: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/11/17/3> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tobias Heinlein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-05-22 19:00:54 UTC  ``` Seems this bug has been overlooked for some time.  I just investigated this issue. Here are my results:  Debian's patch suggests using chdir(chroot_dir) and then chroot(chroot_dir). The thread on openwall linked in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=247278#c0), however, raises some concerns about race conditions and suggests using either chdir(chroot_dir) and then chroot("."), or chroot(chroot_dir) first and then chdir("/"). Upstream used the latter approach and also solved all the other concerns raised in the openwall thread.  This leads us to the fixed versions: 2.0.* until 2.0.9 is vulnerable, 2.0.10 is fixed. 2.1.* until 2.1.2 is vulnerable, 2.1.3 is fixed.  2.1.3 is already stable on all arches, so no stabilization needs to be done here. Since the issue at hand is only exploitable with another separate vulnerability, I don't think a GLSA is necessary. In fact, I wasn't even able to find a detailed (upstream) advisory about this. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-07-10 11:11:22 UTC  ``` not a vulnerability in itself, but this is a high profile daemon and bringing visibility to this kind of vulnerability is a good thing. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-07-12 17:51:37 UTC  ``` GLSA 200907-10 ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Request (syslog-ng)

Hi Steve,

I'm pretty sure this one deserves a CVE id.

<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=505791>

syslog-ng doesn't call chdir() before calling chroot().  The chroot(2) man page is
quite clear that if you don't call chdir() first, the process will inherit a '.'
that is outside of the chroot.

By itself this isn't really a flaw (you'll need some other exploit to even attempt to break out of the chroot), and chroot can be broken out of various other ways.
Typically chroot() should not be considered secure, but I suspect this should
probably get an ID if for no other reason than avoiding future confusion.

Thanks.

Subject: syslog-ng doesn't chdir before chroot
Date: Sat, 15 Nov 2008 10:49:14 -0200
```
Package: syslog-ng
Version: 2.0.9-1ubuntu3
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

I have not had the time to analyze all of syslog-ng code. But by reading
the code section near the chroot call and looking at strace results I
believe that syslog-ng does not chdir to the chroot jail's location
before chrooting into it.

This opens up ways to work around the chroot jail.

See <http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/chroot-practices.html>
(especially the point "Explicitly chdir into the jail")

I'll see whether I can provide a patch at a later stage.
