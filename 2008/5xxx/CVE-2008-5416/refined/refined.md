Here's an analysis of the provided documents regarding CVE-2008-5416:

**Summary:**

CVE-2008-5416 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Microsoft SQL Server sp\_replwritetovarbin extended stored procedure due to improper parameter validation.  Successful exploitation could allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SQL Server service account.  The attack can be local or remote, and could also be exploited via SQL injection.

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `sp_replwritetovarbin` extended stored procedure of Microsoft SQL Server. The procedure does not properly validate input parameters.

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation.
*   **Vulnerability:** Heap overflow.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote code execution, complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, create new accounts with full user rights.
*   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system and could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

**Attack Vector:**

*   An attacker could create a query that calls the vulnerable extended stored procedure with an invalid parameter, causing the heap to overflow and allowing code execution.
*   SQL Injection: A separate SQL injection vulnerability in a web application could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to exploit the `sp_replwritetovarbin` vulnerability with the user credentials of the web application.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated attacker:**  Requires a valid SQL Server account or SQL injection.
*   **Local or remote:** The attack can be launched locally or remotely.

**Solutions and Workarounds:**

*   **Apply an update:** Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-004 addresses this issue.
*   **Workaround:** Deny execute permissions on `sp_replwritetovarbin` or remove it using `sp_dropextendedproc`. This may impact applications using transactional replication with updatable subscriptions.

**Exploit Availability:**

*   Exploit code is publicly available.

**Additional details:**

*   The `sp_replwritetovarbin` extended stored procedure is used by transactional replication with updatable subscribers.
