3. Problem Description
```
```
 a. vCenter Server and vCenter Update Manager update Microsoft
    SQL Server 2005 Express Edition to Service Pack 3
```
```
    Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition (SQL Express)
    distributed with vCenter Server 4.1 Update 1 and vCenter Update
    Manager 4.1 Update 1 is upgraded from  SQL Express Service Pack 2
    to SQL Express Service Pack 3, to address multiple security
    issues that exist in the earlier releases of Microsoft SQL Express.
```
```
    Customers using other database solutions need not update for
    these issues.
```
```
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2008-5416, CVE-2008-0085, CVE-2008-0086,
    CVE-2008-0107 and CVE-2008-0106 to the issues addressed in MS SQL
    Express Service Pack 3.
```
```
    Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
    remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
    available.
```

  * Hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Fusion.
```
```
 b. vCenter Apache Tomcat Management Application Credential Disclosure
```
```
    The Apache Tomcat Manager application configuration file contains
    logon credentials that can be read by unprivileged local users.
```
```
    The issue is resolved by removing the Manager application in
    vCenter 4.1 Update 1.
```
```
    If vCenter 4.1 is updated to vCenter 4.1 Update 1 the logon
    credentials are not present in the configuration file after the
    update.
```
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft SQL Server fails to properly validate parameters to the sp\_replwritetovarbin extended stored procedure

#### Vulnerability Note VU#696644

Original Release Date: 2008-12-24 | Last Revised: 2009-02-11

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Microsoft SQL Server sp\_replwritetovarbin extended stored procedure could allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected server.

### Description

| Some versions of Microsoft SQL Server contain a vulnerability in the sp\_replwritetovarbin stored procedure. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify heap memory and potentially execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is described in SEC Consult Security Advisory < [20081209-0](http://www.sec-consult.com/files/20081209_mssql-sp_replwritetovarbin_memwrite.txt) >. Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-004](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-004.mspx) provides further details, including affected database versions and workarounds.  In order to access sp\_replwritetovarbin, an attacker would need to authenticate to the database first. A separate SQL injection vulnerability in a web application could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to exploit the sp\_replwritetovarbin vulnerability with the user credentials of the web application. Microsoft Security Advisory ([954462](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/954462.mspx)) provides detection and mitigation advice for SQL injection vulnerabilities.Exploit code is publicly available for this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local or remote authenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SQL Server on the affected system. In the case of a SQL injection vulnerability in a web application that uses a vulnerable database, a remote attacker may be able to exploit the sp\_replwritetovarbin vulnerability with credentials of the web application. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-004](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-004.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**Deny execute permissions on sp\_replwritetovarbin as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-004](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-004.mspx).Alternatively, remove sp\_replwritetovarbin using [sp\_dropextendedproc](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa933290%28SQL.80%29.aspx) as described in SEC Consult Security Advisory < [20081209-0](http://www.sec-consult.com/files/20081209_mssql-sp_replwritetovarbin_memwrite.txt) > and "[Removing an Extended Stored Procedure from SQL Server](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa215995%28SQL.80%29.aspx)."Removing execute permissions or removing sp\_replwritetovarbin may impact application functionality. |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## SQL Server sp\_replwritetovarbin Limited Memory Overwrite Vulnerability - CVE-2008-5416

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that SQL Server checks parameters in the "sp\_replwritetovarbin" extended stored procedure. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if untrusted users have access to an affected system or if a SQL injection vulnerability exists on an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-5416](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-5416).

#### Mitigating Factors for SQL Server sp\_replwritetovarbin Limited Memory Overwrite Vulnerability - CVE-2008-5416

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* This issue does not affect supported editions of Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 Service Pack 4, Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Service Pack 3, and Microsoft SQL Server 2008.
* This vulnerability is not exposed anonymously. An attacker would need to either authenticate to exploit the vulnerability or take advantage of a SQL injection vulnerability in a Web application that is able to authenticate.
* By default, MSDE 2000 and SQL Server 2005 Express do not allow remote connections. An authenticated attacker would need to initiate the attack locally to exploit the vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for SQL Server sp\_replwritetovarbin Limited Memory Overwrite Vulnerability - CVE-2008-5416

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Deny permissions on the sp\_replwritetovarbin extended stored procedure**

  Use one of the following procedures:

  **To deny access to the stored procedure**, connect to SQL Server as a sysadmin using osql.exe or sqlcmd.exe or through SQL Server Management Studio and execute the following T-SQL script:

  `use masterdeny execute on sp_replwritetovarbin to public`

  **To deny access to the stored procedure using SQL Server administration**:

  For SQL Server 2000:

  1. Connect to SQL Server using Enterprise Manager as a sysadmin
  2. From the SQL Server Enterprise Manager window, select the desired server
  3. Expand the databases
  4. Expand **Master**
  5. Click **Extended Stored Procedures.** A list of stored procedures appears.
  6. From the list of stored procedures, right-click **sp\_replwritetovarbin** and select **Properties**
  7. In the Properties window, click **Permissions**
  8. Under Users/Database Roles/Public, find **Public**, then click the box in the **EXEC** column. The box turns into a red **X**.
  9. Click **OK** twice

  For SQL Server 2005:

  1. Connect to SQL Server using SQL Server Management Studio as a sysadmin
  2. From the Object Explorer window, select the desired server
  3. Expand the databases and the system databases
  4. Expand **Master**
  5. Expand **Programmability**
  6. Click **Extended Stored Procedures.** A list of stored procedures appears.
  7. From the list of stored procedures, right-click **sp\_replwritetovarbin** and select **Properties**
  8. In the Properties window, click **Permissions**
  9. Click **Deny execution** beside the desired user IDs and click **OK**

  To apply the workaround to all running instances of SQL Server on a local computer, a VB script is available and has been previously provided in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 961040](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/961040).

  **Impact of Workaround:** Disabling the sp\_replwritetovarbin extended stored procedure prevents updates to subscription tables by all users. The impact of this workaround only affects customers that use transactional replication with updatable subscriptions. Customers using transactional replication with read-only subscriptions, bi-directional transactional replication, or peer-to-peer transactional replication are not impacted. For more information on transactional replication with updatable subscriptions, see [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms151718%28sql.90%29.aspx).

  **How to undo the workaround**

  Connect to SQL Server as a sysadmin using osql.exe or sqlcmd.exe or through SQL Server Management Studio and execute the following T-SQL script:

  `use mastergrant execute on sp_replwritetovarbin to public`

  To restore access to the stored procedure via SQL Server administration:

  For SQL Server 2000:

  1. Connect to SQL Server using Enterprise Manager as a sysadmin
  2. From the SQL Server Enterprise Manager window, select the desired server
  3. Expand the databases
  4. Expand **Master**
  5. Click **Extended Stored Procedures.** A list of stored procedures appears.
  6. From the list of stored procedures, right-click **sp\_replwritetovarbin** and select **Properties**
  7. In the Properties window, click **Permissions**
  8. Under Users/Database Roles/Public, find **Public**, then click the box in the **EXEC** column. The box turns into a green checkmark.
  9. Click **OK** twice

  For SQL Server 2005:

  1. Connect to SQL Server using SQL Server Management Studio as a sysadmin
  2. From the Object Explorer window, select the desired server
  3. Expand the databases and the system databases
  4. Expand **Master**
  5. Expand **Programmability**
  6. Click **Extended Stored Procedures.** A list of stored procedures appears.
  7. From the list of stored procedures, right-click **sp\_replwritetovarbin** and select **Properties**
  8. In the Properties window, click **Permissions**
  9. Click **Grant execution** beside the desired user IDs and click **OK**

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

MS09-004 Vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server Could Allow Remote Code
Execution (959420)

Original Release Date: February 12, 2009

Last Revised: February 12, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-055

Risk Level: None

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Microsoft issued a security bulletin which contained security
advisory MS09-004. This security update resolves a vulnerability that
could allow remote code execution if untrusted users access an affected
system or if a SQL injection attack occurs to an affected system. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2008-5416](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5416) to this issue. A description of the vulnerability may
be found at:

* <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-004.mspx>

Certain Avaya products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and may be
affected by this vulnerability.

No Avaya system products are vulnerable, as Microsoft SQL Server is
not installed by default.

## 2. Avaya System Products with Microsoft SQL Server installed: None

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose
operating systems. Occasionally
vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or applications that come with the operating system.
These vulnerabilities often do not impact the
software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of
the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are
not affected by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Microsoft
Windows
platform may be. For affected Microsoft Operating Systems,
Microsoft recommends installing patches. Detailed instructions for
patching the Operating System are given by Microsoft at the following
link:
