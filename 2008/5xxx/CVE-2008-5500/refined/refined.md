  "CVE-2008-5500": {
    "description": "Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. These problems could allow an attacker to crash the browser and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the layout engine, leading to a potential DoS or memory corruption. The same-origin check in Firefox could be bypassed by utilizing XBL-bindings. An attacker could exploit this to read data from other domains. Several problems were discovered in the JavaScript engine. An attacker could exploit feed preview vulnerabilities to execute scripts from page content with chrome privileges. Firefox did not properly handle redirects to an outside domain when an XMLHttpRequest was made to a same-origin resource. It's possible that sensitive information could be revealed in the XMLHttpRequest response.  Firefox did not properly protect a user's data when accessing a same-domain Javascript URL that is redirected to an unparsable Javascript off-site resource. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker may be able to steal a limited amount of private data.  Firefox did not properly parse URLs when processing certain control characters. Firefox did not properly handle an escaped null character. An attacker may be able to exploit this flaw to bypass script sanitization.  Flaws were discovered in the session-restore feature of Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to perform cross-site scripting attacks or execute arbitrary Javascript code with chrome privileges.",
    "root_cause": "A combination of vulnerabilities was found in the browser engine, including a layout engine issue, XBL binding bypass, Javascript engine issues, redirect handling, and session restore flaws.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Same-origin policy bypass",
      "Cross-site scripting",
      "Improper URL handling",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could crash the browser, execute arbitrary code with user privileges, read data from other domains, steal private data, bypass script sanitization, perform cross-site scripting attacks, or escalate privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By tricking a user into opening a malicious website",
       "Exploiting a specially crafted URL",
      "By manipulating XBL bindings",
      "By manipulating XMLHttpRequests",
      "Through malicious Javascript redirects and code",
      "Exploiting vulnerabilities in feed preview functionality"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious website or interact with a manipulated document or URL."
