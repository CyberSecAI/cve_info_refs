{
  "cve": "CVE-2008-5713",
  "description": "Flavio Leitner discovered that a local user can cause a denial of service by generating large amounts of traffic on a large SMP system, resulting in soft lockups.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "Linux kernel 2.6.18"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `qdisc_run` loop in the Linux kernel's network scheduler lacks a preemption point and can run indefinitely in a softirq context on systems with a large number of CPU cores (SMP), when under heavy network load.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unbounded loop in softirq context",
        "Lack of preemption point"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can cause a denial of service, including system soft lockups, which can make applications unresponsive for extended periods.",
    "attack_vector": "A local user generates a high network load on the system.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user on a system with multiple CPU cores and the ability to generate network traffic. It's not required to be privileged user.",
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability occurs in the `__qdisc_run()` function, specifically at line 84 in `net/sched/sch_generic.c`. The patch addresses the issue by adding a preemption point and a check for changes in the jiffies value to prevent the unbounded loop from running for too long."
