Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `slogin_lib.inc.php` file uses a variable `$slogin_path` in include statements. If this variable is not set, it defaults to null, leading to the ability to inject a remote file URL.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** The script stores usernames and passwords in a plain text file (`slog_users.txt`), which is directly accessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**  Unsanitized user-controlled variable (`$slogin_path`) used in `include_once` statements, allowing remote file inclusion.
*   **Sensitive Data Storage:** Storing user credentials in a plain text file without any encryption or hashing.
*   **Insecure Default Configuration**: The path variable is not set in the code, leading to potential RFI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **RFI:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable system, potentially leading to complete compromise.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain usernames and passwords, enabling unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **RFI:** The attacker would provide a malicious URL as the `slogin_path` parameter in a GET request to `slogin_lib.inc.php`. For example:  `/[path]/slogin_lib.inc.php?slogin_path=[remote_txt_shell]`
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** The attacker would directly request the `slog_users.txt` file via the web server. For example: `/[path]/slog_users.txt`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **RFI:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and have access to a server hosting the malicious file they want to include.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server, and the file must be accessible via the webserver.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerable script is named "Simple Text-File Login script (SiTeFiLo) 1.0.6"
*   The `slogin_lib.inc.php` file is the main source of RFI vulnerability.
*   The default user file name `slog_users.txt` is the source of sensitive data exposure.
*   The exploit suggests a fix of including the files directly:  `include_once ("header.inc.php")`
