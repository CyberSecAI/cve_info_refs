Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5189:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from missing input sanitization in the `rubygem-actionpack` component, specifically within the handling of URLs passed to the `redirect_to` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **HTTP Header Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers via specially crafted URLs. This is possible because the `redirect_to` function takes a URL as input and uses it to set the `Location` header in the HTTP response. If the URL contains newline characters (`\r` or `\n`), an attacker can insert additional headers after the `Location` header, potentially leading to various attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary HTTP Header Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP headers. This can lead to various attacks including:
  - **Session Hijacking:** Injecting a `Set-Cookie` header to set a session cookie for the attacker.
  - **Cache Poisoning:** Injecting headers that could manipulate caching mechanisms and potentially serve malicious content from a poisoned cache.
  - **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Though not explicitly mentioned, header injection can be a vector for delivering XSS payloads via crafted headers like `Content-Type` or through other header-based vulnerabilities.
- **Redirection to Malicious Sites**: By manipulating the `Location` header, an attacker could redirect users to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Crafted URLs:** Attackers craft URLs containing newline characters (`\r` or `\n`) and potentially other malicious content, which are then processed by the vulnerable `redirect_to` function in the `rubygem-actionpack`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, meaning they do not need to have local access to the server.
- **Ability to Influence Redirect URL:** The attacker needs the ability to influence the URL parameter that is eventually passed to the `redirect_to` function in the vulnerable application. This could occur in various ways such as through user input fields or other vulnerabilities that allow parameter injection.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided code diff shows the fix involves two changes:
    1. Removing newline characters from the URL before setting the `Location` header:
         ```
        self.headers["Location"] = to_url.gsub(/[\r\n]/, '')
         ```
    2. Escaping the URL before embedding it in the HTML body of the redirect response:
        ```
         self.body = "<html><body>You are being <a href=\"#{CGI.escapeHTML(to_url)}\">redirected</a>.</body></html>"
        ```
- The vulnerability affects multiple SUSE products, as listed in the SUSE Security Summary Report (SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0).

In summary, CVE-2008-5189 is an HTTP header injection vulnerability in `rubygem-actionpack` that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers through specially crafted URLs passed to the `redirect_to` function.
