1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- squirrelmail
Insufficient input checks could allow remote attackers to conduct a
cross site scripting (XSS) attack (CVE-2008-2379).
Affected Prodcuts: 10.3
- gnutls
gnutls did not properly verify x509 certificate chains. An attacker
could exploit that to trick client programs into trusting servers
that would normally get rejected (CVE-2008-4989).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.3, 11.0
- rubygem-activerecord
Missing sanity checks of the :limit and :offset parameters in SQL
queries could potentially be exploited to conduct SQL injection
attacks (CVE-2008-4094).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- rubygem-actionpack
Missing input sanitation in rubygem-actionpack allowed remote
attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers via specially crafted
URLs (CVE-2008-5189).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- samba
Malicious clients could potentially retrieve arbitrary memory
content from a samba server (CVE-2008-4314).
Affected Products: SLES10, 11.0
- dbus-1
Local users could crash services connected to the D-bus
(CVE-2008-3834).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- pdns
Remote attackers could crash pdnsd if the daemon was configured with
distributor-threads=1. With the default configuration pdns is not
affected by this problem (CVE-2008-5277).
Affected Products: 10.3, 11.0
- php5
The php imap module used an old API of the imap client library. The
library aborts programs that use too large buffers. Specially
crafted emails could therefore crash php applications that use imap
(CVE-2008-2829).
Affected Products: 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- pam\_krb5
Insufficient file access permissions checks allowed users to read
Kerberos tickets of other users if pam\_krb5 was configured with the
option "existing\_ticket" (CVE-2008-3825).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

provided that the advisory is not modified in any way. In particular, the
clear text signature should show proof of the authenticity of the text.
