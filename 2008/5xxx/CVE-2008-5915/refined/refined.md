The provided content discusses a new phishing technique called "in-session" phishing, which leverages a vulnerability in JavaScript engines of popular browsers (IE, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome). While not directly referencing CVE-2008-5915, the description of the JavaScript vulnerability could be related. This vulnerability allows a compromised website to detect if a user is logged into another site, creating an opportunity for "in-session" phishing attacks.

Here's a breakdown based on the provided information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A specific JavaScript function leaves a temporary "footprint" on a computer when called. This footprint can be identified by other websites, allowing them to track if the user is logged into another site.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The JavaScript vulnerability allows a malicious website to determine if a user is logged into a specific target website (e.g., online banking).
-  The vulnerability is present in popular browsers including IE, Firefox, Safari and Chrome.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can exploit this to present a fake login popup to users while they have legitimate sessions open in other browser tabs or windows, tricking them into revealing their credentials.
- The attack can present different types of lures beyond fake login prompts such as online surveys or mini-flash games.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user must be logged into a secure website (e.g., online bank).
- The user then encounters a website that has been compromised and injected with malicious code.
- The malicious code detects open secure sessions in other tabs or windows.
- The code then presents a fake login popup from the secure website, prompting the user to re-enter their credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to compromise a website and inject it with malicious JavaScript code.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable JavaScript function, to detect the "footprint".
- The attacker needs to know the target websites that users are likely to have open in other browser tabs or windows.
- The attacker can use social engineering techniques to lure users to the malicious website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The malware infection is temporary.
- The attack requires a user to have simultaneous browser windows open to both a secure site and an infected site.
- The secure site needs to be on the malware's pregenerated list of targets.

This is more detailed than the placeholder description given in the CVE description.
