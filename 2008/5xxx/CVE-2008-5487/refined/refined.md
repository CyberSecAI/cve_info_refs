Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, related to CVE-2008-5487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `admin.php` script of TurnkeyForms Text Link Sales, specifically in the handling of the `id` parameter. This allows for both SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize user input before displaying it back to the user, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will execute in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, retrieve sensitive information, modify data, or even compromise the entire database server.
*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts to perform actions in the context of the victim user, such as stealing cookies or performing actions on the website without the user's knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector for both vulnerabilities is the `id` parameter in the `admin.php` script, specifically in the URL:
`http://<target>/script/admin.php?a=users&id=[malicious_payload]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Understanding of SQL syntax and HTML/Javascript:** For SQL Injection, the attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL and for XSS, the attacker needs to know HTML/Javascript.
*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   **SQL Injection Exploit:**
    The provided example uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract database information:
    `http://demo.turnkeyforms.com/textlinkads/admin.php?a=users&id=999+union+select+1,user(),database(),version(),5,6,7--`
    This injects the SQL code `union+select+1,user(),database(),version(),5,6,7--` into the query and can reveal the user, database and version information.
*   **XSS Exploit:**
    The provided example injects a simple JavaScript alert:
    `http://demo.turnkeyforms.com/textlinkads/admin.php?a=users&id="><script>alert()</script>`
    This injects `<script>alert()</script>` which, when executed by the user's browser, will display an alert box.
