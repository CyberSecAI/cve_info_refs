Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5174:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The `jokeid` parameter in `joke.php` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Specifically, the `jokeid` parameter in the `joke.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including administrator login credentials (`login` and `password` from the `admin_login` table) and member login credentials (`login` and `password` from the `users` table).
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** With access to the database and potentially administrator credentials, an attacker could gain full control of the application or the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL with a specially crafted `jokeid` parameter. For example,
    `www.site.me/patch/joke.php?jokeid=-9999999+union+select+0,concat(login,0x3a,password),2,3,4,5,6,7+from+admin_login/*` is used to extract admin credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker should have some knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit information includes two specific attack vectors, one to retrieve administrator information and another to retrieve member information.
*   The exploit is demonstrated using a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `admin_login` or `users` table.
*   The Exploit Database entry provides a detailed exploit example.
*   The affected application is "Easysitenetwork Jokes Complete Website 2.1.3".
