Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `init.inc` file of the emergecolab application, specifically how it handles the `sitecode` parameter passed through the GET method. The script directly includes a file based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI. The application takes the `sitecode` GET parameter, converts it to lowercase, and includes it directly in a path, without sanitizing it.  This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the `sitecode` parameter, making it vulnerable to path traversal attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server that the web server user has access to, including sensitive system files such as `/etc/passwd`. This can lead to information disclosure and further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to `connect/index.php`, by injecting path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../`) into the `sitecode` parameter. The URL provided in the exploit is:
   `http://site.com/emerge-1.0/connect/index.php?sitecode=../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **No Authentication Required**: This exploit does not require authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit uses null byte injection (`%00`) to potentially truncate file extensions which can further enhance the success rate of the exploit in some circumstances.
- The vulnerability exists in `emergecolab 1.0`.
- The vulnerable code snippet is located in the `init.inc` file:
```php
if (isset($_GET["sitecode"])) {
    #first load the global settings
    include ("conf/global.conf");
    #echo "got get var";
    $_SESSION["sitecode"]=$_GET["sitecode"];
    #set the session variable with the site folder for now just to default
    $_SESSION['sitefolder']='site';
    include ("conf/".strtolower($_GET["sitecode"]).".conf");    // LFI
}
```
