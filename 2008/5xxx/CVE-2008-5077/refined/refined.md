Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2008-5077 from the provided documents:

**CVE-2008-5077: OpenSSL Improper Certificate Validation**

**Root Cause:**

*   The core issue is that the `EVP_VerifyFinal` function within the OpenSSL library, and other functions like `DSA_verify` and `DSA_do_verify`, do not properly check return values.  Specifically, they do not treat a malformed signature as an error.
*   This allows a malformed signature to be treated as a valid one.
*   This flaw exists in how OpenSSL handles certificate chain verification using DSA and ECDSA keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The code does not correctly validate digital signatures during certificate verification.
*   **Return Code Neglect:** The return value from the `EVP_VerifyFinal` function is not properly checked to detect signature verification failures.
*   **Incorrect Handling of Malformed Signatures:** Malformed signatures, instead of being rejected, are incorrectly treated as valid.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Attackers can perform man-in-the-middle attacks by impersonating trusted servers or users.
*   **Bypass Certificate Validation:** The attacker can bypass proper certificate validation when connecting to an SSL/TLS server by presenting a malformed certificate.
*  **Unauthorized Access:**  In some contexts such as with HP-UX, the vulnerability could allow for remote unauthorized access.
*   **Data Injection:** In the case of HP SSL for OpenVMS, this can lead to remote unauthorized data injection and denial of service (DoS).
*   **Spoofing Attacks**: In the case of BIND, an attacker could present a malformed DSA certificate, bypassing validation, potentially allowing spoofing attacks on systems using DNSSEC.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality**: Interception of sensitive information due to bypassing SSL/TLS protection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle**: Attackers can position themselves between the client and server to intercept traffic.
*   **Malicious Server**: An attacker can control a malicious server that presents a malformed signature during the SSL/TLS handshake.
*   **Malicious Certificate:** An attacker can present a malformed signature within a certificate chain during a connection attempt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Positioning**: An attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the server (man-in-the-middle) or to operate a malicious server.
*   **Technical Expertise:** Requires a good understanding of SSL/TLS protocol and digital signature verification mechanisms.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects multiple software products that use the vulnerable OpenSSL library. This includes operating systems (HP-UX, OpenVMS, Red Hat, openSUSE, Slackware, VMware ESX, Apple Mac OS X), applications (BIND, NTP, Sun Grid Engine, Lasso, ZXID, etc.), and various components within these platforms.
*   **Patches and Fixes:** Vendors have released patches to correct the improper return value checks, and update OpenSSL to the version with the fixes (0.9.8j and above).
*   **Impact Severity**: The impact ranges from remote unauthorized access, data injection, to denial of service, depending on the affected software.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   HP-UX: (AV:R/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) - Base Score: 5.0
*   HP OpenVMS: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P) - Base Score: 5.8

**Specific examples found in the provided text:**
*   HP-UX, HP SSL for OpenVMS, and HP System Management Homepage (SMH) were impacted by this vulnerability.
*   VMware ESX service console updates for OpenSSL also addressed this vulnerability.
*   Red Hat, Slackware and openSUSE issued updates for their OpenSSL packages to address the issue.
*   Avaya Communication Manager and other Avaya products that use openssl were also vulnerable.
*   Apple addressed it in Mac OS X updates.
*   oCERT coordinated fixes with various projects affected by the same OpenSSL issue and identified several packages using OpenSSL insecurely like BIND, Lasso, ZXID, and NTP
