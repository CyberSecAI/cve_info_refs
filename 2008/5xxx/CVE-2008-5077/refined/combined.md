#####

##### 3. Problem Description

a. Updated OpenSSL package for the Service Console fixes a security issue.
OpenSSL 0.9.7a-33.24 and earlier does not properly check the return value from the EVP\_VerifyFinal function, which could allow a remote attacker to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature for DSA and ECDSA keys.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-5077 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

#####

b. Update bind package for the Service Console fixes a security issue.
A flaw was discovered in the way Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) checked the return value of the OpenSSL DSA\_do\_verify function. On systems using DNSSEC, a malicious zone could present a malformed DSA certificate and bypass proper certificate validation, allowing spoofing attacks.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2009-0025 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

\* hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

#####

c. Updated vim package for the Service Console addresses several security issues.
Several input flaws were found in Visual editor IMproved's (Vim) keyword and tag handling. If Vim looked up a document's maliciously crafted tag or keyword, it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4101 to this issue.
A heap-based overflow flaw was discovered in Vim's expansion of file name patterns with shell wildcards. An attacker could create a specially crafted file or directory name, when opened by Vim causes the application to stop responding or execute arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-3432 to this issue. Several input flaws were found in various Vim system functions. If a user opened a specially crafted file, it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-2712 to this issue. A format string flaw was discovered in Vim's help tag processor. If a user was tricked into executing the "helptags" command on malicious data, arbitrary code could be executed with the permissions of the user running VIM.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-2953 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0004)

## Topic

Updated OpenSSL packages that correct a security issue are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, and 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and
Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength,
general purpose, cryptography library.

The Google security team discovered a flaw in the way OpenSSL checked the
verification of certificates. An attacker in control of a malicious server,
or able to effect a "man in the middle" attack, could present a malformed
SSL/TLS signature from a certificate chain to a vulnerable client and
bypass validation. (CVE-2008-5077)

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to resolve these issues. For the update to take effect,
all running OpenSSL client applications must be restarted, or the system
rebooted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

openssl security update (RHSA-2009-0004)

Original Release Date: February 6, 2009

Last Revised: June 2, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-038

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and
Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength,
general purpose, cryptography library.

The Google security team discovered a flaw in the way OpenSSL checked
the
verification of certificates. An attacker in control of a malicious
server,
or able to effect a "man in the middle" attack, could present a
malformed
SSL/TLS signature from a certificate chain to a vulnerable client and
bypass validation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2008-5077](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5077) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0004.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with openssl installed:

**Recommended Actions:**
For all vulnerable system products,
Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should

# OpenSSL: Certificate validation error — GLSA **200902-02**

An error in the OpenSSL certificate chain validation might allow for
spoofing attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.8j** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.8j** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

### Description

The Google Security Team reported that several functions incorrectly
check the result after calling the EVP\_VerifyFinal() function, allowing
a malformed signature to be treated as a good signature rather than as
an error. This issue affects the signature checks on DSA and ECDSA keys
used with SSL/TLS.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability and spoof arbitrary
names to conduct Man-In-The-Middle attacks and intercept sensitive
information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8j"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**oCERT-2008-016 multiple OpenSSL signature verification API misuse**

**Description**:

Several functions inside the [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org)
library incorrectly check the result after calling the EVP\_VerifyFinal function.

This bug allows a malformed signature to be treated as a good signature
rather than as an error. This issue affects the signature checks on DSA and
ECDSA keys used with SSL/TLS.

The flaw may be exploited by a malicious server or a man-in-the-middle
attack that presents a malformed SSL/TLS signature from a certificate chain to
a vulnerable client, bypassing validation.

A patch fixing the issue with proper return code checking and further
important recommendations are described in the original OpenSSL Team
advisory.

At the request of the OpenSSL team, oCERT has aided in the remediation
coordination for other projects with similar API misuse vulnerabilities.
In addition to EVP\_VerifyFinal, the return codes from DSA\_verify and
DSA\_do\_verify functions were being incorrectly validated, and packages
doing so are affected in a similar fashion as OpenSSL.

**Affected version**:

[OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org) <= 0.9.8i [1]

The following packages were identified as affected by the same OpenSSL
vulnerability, as they use OpenSSL EVP\_VerifyFinal function and incorrectly
check the return code.

[NTP](http://www.ntp.org) <= 4.2.4p5 (production), <= 4.2.5p150 (development)

[Sun GridEngine](http://gridengine.sunsource.net) <= 5.3

[Gale](http://www.gale.org) <= 0.99

[OpenEvidence](http://www.openevidence.org) <= 1.0.6

[Belgian eID middleware - eidlib](http://eid.belgium.be) <= 2.6.0 [2]

Freedom Network Server <= 2.x

The following packages were identified as affected by a vulnerability
similar to the OpenSSL one, as they use OpenSSL DSA\_verify and/or DSA\_do\_verify function and
incorrectly check the return code.

[BIND](http://www.isc.org) <= 9.4.3

[BIND](http://www.isc.org) 9.0 (all versions), 9.1 (all versions), >= 9.3.0 & <= 9.3.6, >= 9.4.0 & <= 9.4.3, 9.5.0, 9.5.1, 9.6.0

[Lasso](http://lasso.entrouvert.org) <= 2.2.1

[ZXID](http://www.zxid.org) <= 0.29

1 - use of OpenSSL as an SSL/TLS client when connecting to a server
whose certificate uses an RSA key is **NOT** affected. Verification of
client certificates by OpenSSL servers for any key type is **NOT**
affected.

2 - Belgian eID middleware latest versions are not available in source
form, therefore we cannot confirm if they are affected

**Fixed version**:

[OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org) >= 0.9.8j

[NTP](http://www.ntp.org) >= 4.2.4p6 (production), >= 4.2.5p153 (development)

[Sun GridEngine](http://gridengine.sunsource.net) >= 6.0

[Gale](http://www.gale.org), N/A

[OpenEvidence](http://www.openevidence.org), N/A

[Belgian eID middleware - eidlib](http://eid.belgium.be), N/A

Freedom Network Server, N/A

[BIND](http://www.isc.org) >= 9.3.6-P1, >= 9.4.3-P1, >= 9.5.1-P1, >= 9.6.0-P1

[Lasso](http://lasso.entrouvert.org) >= 2.2.2

[ZXID](http://www.zxid.org), N/A
