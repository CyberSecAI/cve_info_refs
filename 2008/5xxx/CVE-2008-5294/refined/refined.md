Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5294:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection found in the `WebStudio eCatalogue` application. Specifically, the `pageid` parameter in the application's URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically within the `pageid` parameter, which allows an attacker to inject SQL code. The nature of it being blind means the attacker does not see the results of the injected query directly in the response, rather they infer the results via application behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database such as user credentials, product details, or other confidential data.
*   The attacker could also potentially modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP requests, by manipulating the `pageid` parameter in the URL.
*   The specific vulnerability lies in the following:
    ```
    http://www.bdigital.biz/index.php?pageid=218
    ```

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific prior authentication is required to exploit this.
*   The attacker must have knowledge of SQL syntax and how to craft SQL queries for blind injection.

**Additional details:**
*   The exploit-db entry provides example URLs to demonstrate the blind SQL injection:
