```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The application allows including local files through the 'page' and 'admin' parameters in index.php. The application does not properly sanitize user input passed to the 'page' and 'admin' parameters before using them in a 'require' statement.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization and path traversal. The application uses `file_exists()` before including the file with `require()`, which doesn't prevent the LFI. The vulnerability exists in index.php via the 'page' and 'admin' GET parameters.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by exploiting the LFI vulnerability, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, or other critical data.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the `index.php` script with manipulated 'page' or 'admin' parameters, containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../..`) and a null byte (`%00`).

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker can be remote and doesn't need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They require the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
