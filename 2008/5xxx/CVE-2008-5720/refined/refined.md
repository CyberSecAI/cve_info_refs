Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-5720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in the default error page of Mayaa, a Java template engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is that the default error page of Mayaa does not properly sanitize or encode user-provided input (specifically, exception messages). This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary script code into the error page, which will then be executed in the context of the user's browser.
* The specific conditions are when a page handles `org.seasar.mayaa.impl.engine.PageNotFoundException` as the standard error page, or when an exception message containing user input is set and displayed by the standard error page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's web browser.
*   This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Performing actions on the user's behalf within the application.
    *   Defacing web pages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack can be carried out over the network using crafted requests.
*   **Specifically:** By triggering an exception that is handled by the vulnerable default error page. This can be achieved by sending requests for non-existent pages or by causing exceptions through other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Low Expertise:** The complexity to exploit this vulnerability is low since it's related to cross-site scripting, which requires little expertise to execute.
* **No user interaction required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any specific action by the user.
*   The attacker must be able to send requests to the server where the vulnerable Mayaa instance is running, and somehow trigger the exception.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   **Affected Versions:** Mayaa 1.1.22 and earlier are vulnerable.
*   **Solutions:**
    *   Upgrade to Mayaa 1.1.23 or later.
    *   Use a custom error page that is not susceptible to XSS.
*   **Severity:** JPCERT/CC rates this as a "High" severity vulnerability.
*   **CVSS:** The CVSS v2 base score is 4.3 (Medium), with an access vector of Network, medium access complexity, no authentication, partial integrity impact, and no confidentiality or availability impact.
