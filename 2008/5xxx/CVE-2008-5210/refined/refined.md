{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the insecure handling of user-supplied input in several PHP files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "System access. The attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and full system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests. The attacker injects a malicious URL into the 'PATH_TO_CODE' parameter in vulnerable PHP scripts.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is mentioned in this exploit, so no specific user level is required."
