Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5290:

**Verification:**

The content from `www.exploit-db.com` directly references CVE-2008-5290, and provides details about the vulnerability, so it is considered related to this CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `full_txt.php` script of Clean CMS 1.5. Specifically the `id` parameter is not sanitized.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** The `id` parameter in `full_txt.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection, which could allow an attacker to extract data or potentially manipulate the database.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The same `id` parameter is vulnerable to XSS attacks, enabling an attacker to inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the victim's browser.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed within the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The `id` parameter in the `full_txt.php` script is the main attack vector.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable parameter `id` in the `full_txt.php` script

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit examples demonstrate how to test for blind SQL injection using a time-based approach (`substring(@@version,1,1)`).
*   The XSS example shows that any javascript code can be injected into the `id` parameter, which will then be executed by the browser of the user loading the page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides more detail than the basic CVE description, including specific examples of how to exploit both SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
*   The exploit examples are basic, but they show the vulnerable parameters.
