How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : flamethrower (0.1.8-1+etch1)
Vulnerability  : insecure temp file generation
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-5141
Debian Bug     : 506350

Dmitry E. Oboukhov discovered that flamethrower creates predictable temporary
filenames, which may lead to a local denial of service through a symlink
attack.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.1.8-1+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.8-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your flamethrower package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch
- -------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

DEO> Package: mplayer nws ppp twiki
DEO> Severity: grave
DEO> Tags: security

DEO> This message about the error concerns a few packages  at  once.   I've
DEO> tested all the packages on my Debian mirror.  (post|pre)(inst|rm)  and
DEO> config scripts were tested.

DEO> In some packages I've discovered scripts with errors which may be used
DEO> by a user for damaging important system files.

DEO> For example if a script uses in its work a temp file which is  created
DEO> in /tmp directory, then every user can create symlink  with  the  same
DEO> name in this directory in order to  destroy  or  rewrite  some	system
DEO> file.

DEO> I set Severity into grave for  this  bug.   The  table	of  discovered
DEO> problems is below.

Package: flamethrower
Version: 0.1.8-1
Severity: important
Tags: security

Hi,

The following CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) id was published for
flamethrower.

[CVE-2008-5141](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5141)[1]:
> flamethrower in flamethrower 0.1.8 allows local users to overwrite
> arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a /tmp/multicast.tar.#####
> temporary file.

Please note that a more careful inspection of the script reveals that even
more insecure paths are used, not just the one mentioned in the CVE.
Searching for /tmp and $tmp_dir and the other vars taking $tmp_dir as their
value will reveal the rest.

If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the CVE id in
the changelog entry.
