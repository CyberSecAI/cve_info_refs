Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5779

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `lpro.php` script of the FLDS 1.2a application. Specifically, the `id` parameter is not validated before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw (CWE-89). This occurs because the `id` parameter in the `lpro.php` script is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and password hashes.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  Gaining access to database credentials can lead to more severe attacks, such as modifying data, or potentially taking over the server if additional vulnerabilities are present.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `lpro.php` script with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests.
*   **SQL Knowledge:**  Some knowledge of SQL syntax is necessary to construct effective injection queries.

**Technical Details**
The provided exploit demonstrates the vulnerability using a `UNION SELECT` statement:

```
http://localhost/[path]/lpro.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,concat(username,0x3a,password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 from users
```

This SQL injection query aims to bypass the original SQL query, to retrieve the usernames and passwords from the `users` table. The `concat(username,0x3a,password)` part combines the username and password (separated by a colon) into a single output column.

**Additional Notes:**
* The content mentions that the script is "full of bugs like this".
* The identified vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.5/10, and is rated as having high risk, low complexity, and remote exploitability.
