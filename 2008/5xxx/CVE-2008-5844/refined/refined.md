  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The filter extension in PHP has a flaw where the 'unsafe_raw' filter does not apply any sanitization or encoding of special characters when used as a default filter even when flags are specified. This is because of an intentional bypass in the php_sapi_filter() function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The 'unsafe_raw' filter, when set as the default filter, does not honor flags like FILTER_FLAG_STRIP_LOW, which are meant to strip or encode special characters.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "If magic_quotes_gpc is enabled, the magic quotes functionality is broken, as it remains off even when set to on. User submitted data is not filtered or sanitized when FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW is set as the default filter and specific flags that perform sanitization such as FILTER_FLAG_STRIP_LOW are enabled.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can supply malicious input data via GET, POST or COOKIE parameters that will bypass any sanitization intended by the 'unsafe_raw' filter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests with malicious data via GET, POST, or COOKIE parameters to an application using PHP and having the described vulnerability. The attacker does not require any special access or privileges to perform the attack."
