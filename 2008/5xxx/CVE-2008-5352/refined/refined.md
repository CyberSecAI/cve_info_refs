{
  "CVE-2008-5352": {
    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with unpacking applets and Java Web Start applications using the \"unpack200\" JAR unpacking utility. This may allow an untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges, granting itself permissions to read and write local files or execute local applications accessible to the user.",
    "Root cause": "Buffer overflow in the 'unpack200' JAR unpacking utility within the Java Runtime Environment.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could escalate privileges, potentially gaining the ability to read, write, or execute local files and applications.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious JAR file",
      "Untrusted applet",
      "Java Web Start application"
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted JAR file to the user. This could be achieved by hosting the malicious file on a website, sending it as an email attachment, or through another file-sharing mechanism."
