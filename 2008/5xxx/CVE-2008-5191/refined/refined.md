```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the 'poll_id' parameter of the poll.php script and the 'sp_id' parameter of the staticpages.php script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, potentially including usernames and passwords.
- Attack vectors: By crafting malicious SQL queries in the poll_id and sp_id parameters of the respective scripts.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
