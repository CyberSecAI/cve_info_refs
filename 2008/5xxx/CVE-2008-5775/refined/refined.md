Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in Aperto Blog 0.1.1:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application uses user-supplied input from the `action` and `get` GET parameters in `admin.php` and `index.php` respectively, directly in `include()` statements without sufficient sanitization, allowing inclusion of arbitrary local files.
*   **SQL Injection:** The application uses user-supplied input from the `id` GET parameter in `categories.php` directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsanitized Input:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-provided input before using it in file inclusion or SQL query operations.
*   **Direct Inclusion:** The `include()` function is used directly with user input in `admin.php` and `index.php`.
*   **Direct SQL Query:** The `mysql_query()` function is used directly with unsanitized user input in `categories.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **LFI:** Successful exploitation of the LFI vulnerability could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, or other critical data.
*   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation of the SQL Injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** Both vulnerabilities are exploitable through specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable PHP files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely via HTTP requests, without needing any special access to the server other than network connectivity to the web application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided information suggests that no prior authentication is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Specific Vulnerable Files and Parameters:**

*   `admin.php` with `action` parameter
*   `index.php` with `get` parameter
*   `categories.php` with `id` parameter

**Exploit Examples:**

*   **LFI:**
    *   `http://localhost/[path]/admin.php?action=[LFI]`
    *   `http://localhost/[path]/index.php?get=[LFI]`
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   `http://localhost/[path]/categories.php?id=[SQL]`
