Only opensuse 11.0 and 11.1 were affected by diff.external
issue and packages have been released for that.
opensuse 10.3 was only affected by the remote hole and
not by diff.external. packages were already released, too.

# git: Multiple vulnerabilties — GLSA **200903-15**

Multiple vulnerabilities in gitweb allow for remote execution of arbitrary
commands.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-util/git** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.0.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.0.6** |

### Background

GIT - the stupid content tracker, the revision control system used by
the Linux kernel team.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in gitweb that is part of
the git package:

* Shell metacharacters related to git\_search are not properly sanitized
  (CVE-2008-5516).
* Shell metacharacters related to git\_snapshot and git\_object are not
  properly sanitized (CVE-2008-5517).
* The diff.external configuration variable as set in a repository can be
  executed by gitweb (CVE-2008-5916).

### Impact

A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands via
shell metacharacters in a query, remote attackers with write access to
a git repository configuration can execute arbitrary commands with the
privileges of the user running gitweb by modifying the diff.external
configuration variable in the repository and sending a crafted query to
gitweb.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All git users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/git-1.6.0.6"
```
### References

--=-=-=

Current gitweb has a possible local privilege escalation bug that allows a
malicious repository owner to run a command of his choice by specifying
diff.external configuration variable in his repository and running a
crafted gitweb query.

Recent (post 1.4.3) gitweb itself never generates a link that would result
in such a query, and the safest and cleanest fix to this issue is to
simply drop the support for it.  Maintenance release v1.6.0.6, v1.5.6.6,
v1.5.5.6 and v1.5.4.7 are already available at k.org (see the announcement
for v1.6.0.6 I sent out a few minutes ago), and the master branch and
others pushed out tonight have the same fix.

This message contains two patches (credits go to Matt McCutchen, Jeff King
and Jakub Narebski) to do the fix yourself:

 (1) for Git 1.5.4.X, 1.5.5.X, and 1.5.6.X, and

 (2) for Git 1.6.0.X.

Distro packagers and people on the vendor security list have been notified
about this fix earlier this week; people running gitweb from vendor
supplied binaries should be able to get updates from them as well.

Subject: [PATCH] gitweb: do not run "git diff" that is Porcelain

Jakub says that legacy-style URI to view two blob differences are never
generated since 1.4.3.  This codepath runs "git diff" Porcelain from the
gitweb, which is a no-no.  It can trigger diff.external command that is
specified in the configuration file of the repository being viewed.

This patch applies to v1.5.4 and later.

--=-=-=
Current gitweb has a possible local privilege escalation bug that allows a
malicious repository owner to run a command of his choice by specifying
diff.external configuration variable in his repository and running a
crafted gitweb query.
Recent (post 1.4.3) gitweb itself never generates a link that would result
in such a query, and the safest and cleanest fix to this issue is to
simply drop the support for it. Maintenance release v1.6.0.6, v1.5.6.6,
v1.5.5.6 and v1.5.4.7 are already available at k.org (see the announcement
for v1.6.0.6 I sent out a few minutes ago), and the master branch and
others pushed out tonight have the same fix.
This message contains two patches (credits go to Matt McCutchen, Jeff King
and Jakub Narebski) to do the fix yourself:
(1) for Git 1.5.4.X, 1.5.5.X, and 1.5.6.X, and
(2) for Git 1.6.0.X.
Distro packagers and people on the vendor security list have been notified
about this fix earlier this week; people running gitweb from vendor
supplied binaries should be able to get updates from them as well.

Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=0001-hotfix-1.5.456.X.txt
Content-Description: gitweb hotfix for 1.5.[456].X series
>From dfff4b7aa42de7e7d58caeebe2c6128449f09b76 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Junio C Hamano <gitster@pobox.com>
Date: Tue, 16 Dec 2008 19:42:02 -0800
Subject: [PATCH] gitweb: do not run "git diff" that is Porcelain
Jakub says that legacy-style URI to view two blob differences are never
generated since 1.4.3. This codepath runs "git diff" Porcelain from the
gitweb, which is a no-no. It can trigger diff.external command that is
specified in the configuration file of the repository being viewed.
This patch applies to v1.5.4 and later.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-723-1: Git vulnerabilities

18 February 2009

Git vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [git-core](/security/cves?package=git-core) -

## Details

It was discovered that Git did not properly handle long file paths. If a user

were tricked into performing commands on a specially crafted Git repository, an

attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-3546](/security/CVE-2008-3546))

It was discovered that the Git web interface (gitweb) did not correctly handle

shell metacharacters when processing certain commands. A remote attacker could

send specially crafted commands to the Git server and execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the Git web server. This issue only applied to Ubuntu

7.10 and 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-5516](/security/CVE-2008-5516), [CVE-2008-5517](/security/CVE-2008-5517))

It was discovered that the Git web interface (gitweb) did not properly restrict

the diff.external configuration parameter. A local attacker could exploit this

issue and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Git web server.

This issue only applied to Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and 8.10. ([CVE-2008-5916](/security/CVE-2008-5916))
