Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2008-5916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `diff.external` configuration variable within Git repositories. This variable, when set, allows Git to use an external diff command instead of its built-in diff functionality. Gitweb, the web interface for Git repositories, did not properly sanitize or restrict the use of this variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted `diff.external` Configuration:** Gitweb did not prevent the execution of the `diff.external` command specified in a repository's configuration. This allows for arbitrary command execution.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Gitweb failed to sanitize or validate the `diff.external` variable, allowing a malicious user to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A remote attacker with write access to a Git repository configuration can modify the `diff.external` variable to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting Gitweb. These commands would run with the privileges of the user running the Gitweb process.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker, with the ability to modify repository configurations, could exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges on the system hosting Gitweb.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack (with write access):** An attacker with write access to a Git repository can modify the `diff.external` configuration variable within the repository itself. When a crafted query is sent to gitweb that triggers a diff operation the value of the `diff.external` variable is executed as a command.
*   **Local Attack (with write access to repo config):** A local attacker with the ability to modify the `diff.external` variable can trigger arbitrary command execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** Must have write access to the Git repository configuration to modify the `diff.external` variable. Additionally, must be able to send a request to the server via gitweb to trigger a diff operation.
*   **Local Attacker:** Requires the ability to modify a repository's configuration which is local to the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to how Gitweb handles the `diff.external` configuration variable.
*   The vulnerability is present in older versions of Git, specifically prior to 1.6.0.6.
*   Patches for the vulnerability primarily involve removing the functionality that allows for execution of `diff.external` commands from within the web interface, and preventing the legacy style URI.
*   The vulnerability is described as a local privilege escalation in some sources. However remote exploitation is possible if the attacker has write access to the git repository configuration.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Git version 1.6.0.6 or later.
*   Apply the provided patches for older versions of Git.
