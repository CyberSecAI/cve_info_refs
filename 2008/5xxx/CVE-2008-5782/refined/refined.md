Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5782:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `bannerclick.php` script of ZEEMATRI v3.0. Specifically, the `adid` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `adid` parameter of the `bannerclick.php` script before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This can lead to the following:
    -  Retrieval of sensitive information from the database (e.g., admin usernames and passwords, as shown in the provided exploit).
    -  Potential modification or deletion of data within the database.
    -  Complete compromise of the application and possibly the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to the `bannerclick.php` script, by manipulating the `adid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of SQL. No prior authentication is required for the attack.

**Exploit Details:**
The provided exploit demonstrates how to extract the admin username and password:
```
www.[target].com/Script/bannerclick.php?adid=-5+union+select+1,2,concat(name,0x3e,pwd),4,5,6,7,8,9+from+admin--
```
This exploit utilizes a UNION SELECT statement to extract the `name` and `pwd` columns from the `admin` table.
