Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5123

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the insecure cookie authentication mechanism implemented in CCLeague Pro version 1.2 and earlier. The application relies on easily manipulated cookie data for user authentication and authorization. Specifically, the application checks if the `PHPSESSID` cookie matches the current session ID, and if a `type` cookie is set to `admin`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Insecure Cookie Validation:** The application trusts client-side cookie values to determine if a user is authenticated and has admin privileges. The `PHPSESSID` check is ineffective as it returns an empty string if a session isn't already created which is easily spoofed by setting a cookie with an empty string.
2.  **Lack of Proper Session Management:** The script does not implement proper server-side session handling.
3.  **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** It relies solely on client-controlled cookies to grant administrative access.
4. **SQL Injection:** While the primary vulnerability is insecure cookie validation, the exploit also mentions a SQL injection vulnerability in the `admin.php` file in the line that retrieves admin config if magic quotes are off.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the administrative authentication and gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel of the CCLeague Pro application. This grants complete control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack is performed through the following steps:
1.  Crafting a malicious JavaScript code that sets two cookies: one setting the type cookie to "admin" and the other setting PHPSESSID cookie to empty string "".
2.  (If no errors when accessing admin panel) Using another malicious Javascript to set a cookie named "u" with an administrator's email. This bypasses the check where admin preferences are loaded based on this cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker requires the following:
1.  The ability to execute JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable web application (e.g., by pasting the javascript code into the browser's address bar).
2.  Knowledge of an existing admin's email for setting cookie "u"

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit details mention that the vendor has not been notified.
- The vulnerability also allows for SQL injection, if magic quotes are disabled, in the administrator settings retrieval query, though this is not the primary exploit detailed for this CVE.
- The exploit provides JavaScript code snippets to create the necessary cookies for gaining administrative access.
