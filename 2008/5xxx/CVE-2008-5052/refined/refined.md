  "summary": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in the JavaScript engine of Mozilla products (Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey) related to improper handling of XML attribute values. This results in memory corruption and a crash. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely via crafted XML input. The root cause is a flaw in the `AppendAttributeValue` function and specifically in the `js_RepeatChar` function, which causes an invalid memory write. The issue is identified by `e4x/extensions/regress-410192.js` test case."
