# FreeBSD 6x/7 - 'protosw' Local Privilege Escalation

#### EDB-ID:

###### 7581

#### CVE:

###### N/A

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Don Bailey](/?author=898)

#### Type:

###### [local](/?type=local)

---

#### Platform:

###### [FreeBSD](/?platform=freebsd)

#### Date:

###### 2008-12-28

**Vulnerable App:**

```
/*
 * This is a quick and very dirty exploit for the FreeBSD protosw vulnerability
 * defined here:
 * http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-08:13.protosw.asc
 *
 * This will overwrite your credential structure in the kernel. This will
 * affect more than just the exploit's process, which is why this doesn't
 * spawn a shell. When the exploit has finished, your login shell should
 * have euid=0.
 *
 * Enjoy, and happy holidays!

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\* FreeBSD <= 6.4-RELEASE Netgraph Exploit
\* by zx2c4
\*
\*
\* This is an exploit for CVE-2008-5736, the FreeBSD protosw
\* and loosely based on Don Bailey's 2008 exploit -
\* http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/7581/ . The thing with
\* Don's exploit is that it relies on having a known location
\* of allproc, which means having access to the kernel or
\* debugging symbols, either of which might not be available.
\* Initial attempts included a general memory search for some
\* characteristics of allproc, but this was difficult to make
\* reliable. This solution here is a much more standard - get
\* the current thread, change its permissions, and execl to
\* shell. Additionally, it breaks out of chroots and freebsd
\* jails by reparenting to pid 1 and copying its fds.
\*
\* This reliably works on kernels on or below 6.4-RELEASE:
\*
\* $ gcc a.c
\* $ ./a.out

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-08:13.protosw Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: netgraph / bluetooth privilege escalation
Category: core
Module: sys\_kern
Announced: 2008-12-23
Credits: Christer Oberg
Affects: All FreeBSD releases
Corrected: 2008-12-23 01:23:09 UTC (RELENG\_7, 7.1-PRERELEASE)
2008-12-23 01:23:09 UTC (RELENG\_7\_1, 7.1-RC2)
2008-12-23 01:23:09 UTC (RELENG\_7\_0, 7.0-RELEASE-p7)
2008-12-23 01:23:09 UTC (RELENG\_6, 6.4-STABLE)

2008-12-23 01:23:09 UTC (RELENG\_6\_3, 6.3-RELEASE-p7)
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The FreeBSD kernel provides support for a variety of different types of
communications sockets, including IPv4, IPv6, ISDN, ATM, routing protocol,
link-layer, netgraph(4), and bluetooth sockets. As an early form of
object-oriented design, much of the functionality specific to different
types of sockets is abstracted via function pointers.
II. Problem Description
Some function pointers for netgraph and bluetooth sockets are not
properly initialized.
III. Impact
A local user can cause the FreeBSD kernel to execute arbitrary code.
This could be used by an attacker directly; or it could be used to gain
root privilege or to escape from a jail.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems without local untrusted users
are not vulnerable. Furthermore, systems are not vulnerable if they
have neither the ng\_socket nor ng\_bluetooth kernel modules loaded or
compiled into the kernel.
Systems with the security.jail.socket\_unixiproute\_only sysctl set to
1 (the default) are only vulnerable if they have local untrusted users
outside of jails.
If the command
# kldstat -v | grep ng\_
produces no output, the system is not vulnerable.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 6-STABLE, or 7-STABLE, or to the
RELENG\_7\_0, RELENG\_6\_4, or RELENG\_6\_3 security branch dated after the
correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 6.3, 6.4,
and 7.0 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 6.x]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:13/protosw6x.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:13/protosw6x.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 7.x]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:13/protosw.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:13/protosw.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch.
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.
