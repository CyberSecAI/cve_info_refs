{
  "CVE-2008-5736": {
    "Description": "Some function pointers for netgraph and bluetooth sockets are not properly initialized.",
    "Root cause": "Uninitialized function pointers in the netgraph and bluetooth socket implementations within the FreeBSD kernel.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of uninitialized function pointers"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user can cause the FreeBSD kernel to execute arbitrary code, leading to privilege escalation (potentially root) or escape from a jail.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Local exploitation via specially crafted netgraph or bluetooth socket operations."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Local user access on a vulnerable FreeBSD system. The system needs to have either the `ng_socket` or `ng_bluetooth` kernel modules loaded or compiled into the kernel. The exploit does not require a known memory location of `allproc` or kernel debugging symbols.",
      "Additional details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by performing a shutdown on a socket of type `PF_NETGRAPH`, `SOCK_DGRAM`, and `NG_DATA` which results in a null dereference. The exploit overwrites the null page with code that elevates the privileges of the current process to root, escapes from chroot and FreeBSD jail environments and then executes `/bin/sh`."
