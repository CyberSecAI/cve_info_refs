How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Gallery 1.5.10 and 1.6-RC3 Released - Last G1 Releases from us!

Submitted by ckdake on Fri, 2008-11-21 21:35

Gallery 1.5.10 and Gallery 1.6-RC3 are now available for download. These releases fix one **security issue** and a handful of other small issues.

**These releases are also the last official releases of Gallery 1 from the Gallery project.**

We **strongly recommend** that all users of Gallery 1.5.9, 1.6-RC2, and earlier upgrade to this release to **protect your Gallery installation**. You can download them from the [Gallery 1](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7130&package_id=7239) download page on SourceForge. [Upgrade instructions](http://codex.gallery2.org/index.php/Gallery1%3AUpgrading) are available on our documentation site. Read on for some more details about what is happening to Gallery 1.

These releases address a security issue that allowed malicious users to gain administrative access if "register globals" is enabled in web server configuration. We thank John Hisdock for responsibly reporting this to us and are happy to award him with a [security bounty](http://codex.gallery2.org/Bounties).

Gallery 1 has been good to us! From Bharat's [first public code release](http://gallery.menalto.com/node/4) in July 2000, to [Gallery 1.0](http://gallery.menalto.com/node/20) on June 4th 2001, to the multi-year behemoth of Gallery 2 and on to the current Gallery 3 product, over 2 million of you have downloaded Gallery 1 and loved it.
Gallery 1 was the [SourceForge project of the month in 2003](http://sourceforge.net/potm/potm-2003-10.php), and even now, more than 3 years after the [Gallery 2.0 release](http://gallery.menalto.com/node/3630), several thousand of you still download Gallery 1 every month. We thank you for this ongoing support!

As much as we'd like to keep giving you Gallery 1 enhancements forever, it is a very old product and we've already completely stopped work on Gallery 2 to give us more time to work on Gallery 3. Gallery 3 is going to be great and we're sure that you'll love it as it is strongly influenced by all the lessons we learned working on Gallery 1 and Gallery 2, but for those of you that really don't want to change...

Those of you who have already migrated to the Gallery 1.6 release candidates will be pleased to hear that Jens Tkotz (long time and last remaining Gallery 1 developer) has forked Gallery 1 into [Jallery](http://www.jallery.com/) where he will continue development on what would have been Gallery 1.6. He does this with the team's blessing and our best wishes (but secretly we're also hoping that he will stick around here to work on Gallery 3 too!)

No future development will be done on Gallery 1 as part of this project, and the only future Gallery 1 code from us will be critical security fixes (and we don't expect any of these!) As for support services like the forums here: as soon as Jens' versions of these are available on [jallery.com](http://www.jallery.com/), we will be disabling new posts related to G1 here.

As always, we thank you for your continued support!

well, too bad!

not long ago there seemed to be something like a commitment to at least bring Gallery 1.6 to a stable release ([Week of Gallery 1.6](http://gallery.menalto.com/week_of_gallery_1.6)). unfortunately this is not going to happen.

and for the alternative:

[www.jallery.com](http://www.jallery.com) does not seem to be alive, I only get this, which is not exactly encouraging:

`Fatal error: Class 'views_plugin_row' not found in /home/Special/jallery/public_html/sites/all/modules/project/project.views.inc on line 330`

will Gallery 3 include a direct upgrade path for Gallery 1 users?

cheers,

-- Peter

So here I've been staying with Gallery 1 for ages, waiting patiently for Gallery 2 to become something I feelt good about upgrade to and now it seems like I'll just have to forget Gallery 2 and start waiting for Gallery 3 instead...

It seems odd that Gallery 1.6 is so close to release (as the version name RC3 name suggests) and then just drop it. Why not release a final 1.6 build first?

Or am I just fooled by the version name and 1.6 is nowhere near a final version? (I haven't tried it yet.)

AdrianB- Jens has been the only person working on G1.6 here, so the fact that he is now working on it as "Jallery" is no change in it's momentum! I think it's pretty close to a "1.0" release.

As for the Gallery 3 timeline, more news on that next week, but it will be soon!
