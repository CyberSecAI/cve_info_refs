ElcomSoft Claims Adobe Acrobat 9 Is a Hundred Times Less Secure

Moscow,  Russia  –  November  26,  2008  –  ElcomSoft  Co.  Ltd.
announces the availability of an updated version of Advanced PDF
Password  Recovery  5.0,  a  product  to  unlock  password-protected
PDF files created by Adobe Acrobat and compatible products. The
new version supports  the new  Adobe Acrobat  9  format,  offering a
hundred  times  increase  in  password  recovery  speed  for  the  new
format  thanks  to  a security  weakness discovered  by  the company
in Adobe Acrobat 9.

ElcomSoft,  the  company  that  discovered  a  security  weakness  in  Adobe's
eBook  software  back  in  2001,  has  found  vulnerability  in  another  Adobe
Product.  While  Adobe  advertises  Acrobat  9  as  the  most  secure  PDF
production  tool  ever  with  enhanced  256-bit  encryption,  ElcomSoft  has
discovered that the new PDF protection system implemented in Acrobat 9
is even faster to recover than in previous versions. In fact, a hundred times
faster.  “The  new  version  of  Adobe  Acrobat  is  easier  to  break”,  claims
ElcomSoft CEO Vladimir Katalov, quoting a speed increase of two orders
of magnitude for the new format. “The new product has surprisingly weak
protection”,  he  adds.  According  to  ElcomSoft’s  CEO,  using  256-bit  AES
encryption  per  se  is  not  enough  to  achieve  ultimate  security  without
employing complex approach and consideration of the entire security system.

ElcomSoft claims that the time required to recover an original password-to-open is reduced in the new Acrobat due to
the  weakened  password  verification  mechanism  used  in  Acrobat  9.  Backing  up  the  claim  is  the  latest  release  of
Elcomsoft  Advanced  PDF  Password  Recovery  which  provides  the  recovery  speed  of  nearly  two  orders  of  magnitude
greater  for  Adobe  9  PDF  files  than  for  PDF  documents  protected  with  previous  versions  of  Adobe  Acrobat.  The
upcoming  inclusion  of  ElcomSoft’s  proprietary  GPU  acceleration  will  provide  even  faster  password  recovery,  up  to  a
thousand  times  faster  than  it  was  possible  for  previous  Acrobat  versions.  According  to  numerous  researches,  most
people use passwords of up to 7 characters. With the new weakened protection featured in Acrobat 9, even 8-character
passwords are no longer secure.
