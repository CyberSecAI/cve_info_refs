Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a weakened password verification mechanism implemented in Adobe Acrobat 9's new PDF protection system. This makes it significantly easier and faster to recover passwords compared to previous versions. It appears that while 256-bit AES encryption is used, the overall implementation is flawed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Weak Password Verification:** The core vulnerability lies in how Acrobat 9 verifies passwords, making it susceptible to faster brute-force or dictionary attacks than previous versions. This suggests a weakness in the key derivation or password hashing process.
*   **Inadequate System Design:** According to ElcomSoft, merely using strong encryption like 256-bit AES is insufficient without a comprehensive and secure system design.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Faster Password Recovery:** Attackers can recover passwords protecting PDF documents much more quickly than with previous versions of Adobe Acrobat. This means even reasonably complex passwords, such as 8-character passwords, are no longer secure.
*   **Circumvention of Security:** The vulnerability allows for the circumvention of PDF document security features, such as the ability to print, copy, or edit restricted documents.
*   **Data Exposure:** This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within PDF documents.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Brute-force attacks:**  Attackers can use tools like ElcomSoft's Advanced PDF Password Recovery to rapidly try different password combinations.
*   **Dictionary attacks:** Attackers can use lists of common passwords to find the correct one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to the Protected PDF:** The attacker needs access to the password-protected PDF file.
*   **Password Recovery Tools:**  The attacker needs to use password recovery software, such as Elcomsoft's product, that exploits this vulnerability.
*   **No specific prior permissions are required**: The vulnerability lies within the Acrobat 9 software itself, so it doesn't rely on any other weaknesses in the system where Acrobat is being used.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content claims that password recovery is "a hundred times faster" in Acrobat 9, and with GPU acceleration, it could be "a thousand times faster" compared to previous versions, highlighting the severity of the issue.
*   The vulnerability appears to stem from a design flaw, not a specific implementation of encryption.
*   The primary concern is the weakened password verification process rather than a weakness in the encryption itself.
