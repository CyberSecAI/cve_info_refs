Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-5726:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `thread.php` script of StormBoards 1.0.1. Specifically, the `id` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection (CWE-89) flaw. Attackers can manipulate the `id` parameter in the `thread.php` script to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server. This can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Retrieval of sensitive data from the database (e.g., user credentials, private information).
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modification or deletion of data stored in the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Potential for gaining administrative access if the database user has sufficient privileges.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Possibility of causing a denial-of-service condition on the database server by executing resource-intensive queries.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over HTTP.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector is the `id` parameter of the `thread.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server hosting StormBoards 1.0.1.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication or valid user credentials are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details from provided content:**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** `thread.php` with the `id` parameter.
*   **Exploit Example:**  The provided exploit examples show how to use `UNION SELECT` statements in the `id` parameter to extract data from the `users` table by manipulating the SQL query, particularly the `user_name` and `user_password` fields.
    *   `site.com/thread.php?id=-null union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,concat(user\_name,0x3e,user\_password),10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25 from users`
    *   `al-andalos.com/thread.php?id=-null+union+all+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,concat(user_name,0x3e,user_password),10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25+from+users--`
