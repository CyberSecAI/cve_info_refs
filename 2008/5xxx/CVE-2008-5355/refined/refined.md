      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-5355",
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Sun Java implementation",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer overflows in processing image files and fonts.",
        "Vulnerabilities in Java Web Start and Java Plug-in.",
        "Insecure temporary file creation with guessable file names.",
        "Lack of digital signature checking for JRE downloads.",
        "Vulnerabilities related to deserializing calendar objects.",
        "Insecure UTF-8 decoder allowing multiple representations of UTF-8 input.",
        "Ability for applets to list the contents of the user's home directory.",
        "Vulnerabilities in processing RSA public keys.",
        "Authentication issues through Kerberos leading to DoS.",
        "Vulnerabilities in JAX-WS and JAXB packages.",
        "Insecure parsing of ZIP files allowing arbitrary memory reading.",
        "Code loaded from the local filesystem can access localhost."
        
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. Additionally, denial of service, information disclosure, memory content disclosure, writing/executing local files, session hijacking, cookie theft, same-origin policy bypass, loading untrusted JAR files, establishing network connections to arbitrary hosts, modifying graphics configurations, bypassing HMAC authentication and privilege escalation may occur. Vulnerabilities also allow applet code to be executed with older possibly vulnerable JRE versions.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted JAR archives",
        "Applets",
        "Java Web Start applications",
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to entice a user to open a malicious JAR archive, applet, or Java Web Start application",
      "In some cases: trusted environment, user interaction, DNS Man-in-the-Middle or Cross-Site-Scripting attacks."
