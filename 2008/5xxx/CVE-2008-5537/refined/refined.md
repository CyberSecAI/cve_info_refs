Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the way multiple antivirus (AV) software products handle and scan web pages, particularly HTML files. The vulnerability stems from the ability to bypass the malicious webpage detection mechanism of multiple AV products by prepending a valid "MZ" header (a DOS executable header) to an HTML file and renaming it to a non-HTML extension. This confuses the AV scanners which do not properly check for the underlying content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypassing Malicious Webpage Detection:** The core weakness is the failure of the listed AV products to correctly identify malicious HTML content when disguised with an "MZ" header and a non-HTML extension.
*   **Inadequate Content Inspection:** The antivirus solutions are not thoroughly inspecting the content type, relying primarily on file extensions.
*   **Misinterpretation of File Format:** AV software appears to be misled by the presence of the "MZ" header, often used for executable files and assumes content is non HTML and non malicious.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malware Infection:** An attacker can deliver malicious HTML (e.g., a drive-by download exploit) embedded within a file with a non-HTML extension, causing exploitation when opened in a vulnerable browser.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation may lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the user's system.
*   **Bypassing Security Measures:** The vulnerability effectively bypasses web-based protection provided by the affected antivirus software.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** Attackers can host the disguised HTML files on web servers.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers can trick users into opening the renamed files through phishing or other social engineering techniques.
*   **Drive-by Downloads:** Upon visiting a compromised site, users can be unknowingly exposed to the malicious HTML content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the specific method for crafting the malicious file (prepending the "MZ" header and renaming to a non-HTML extension).
*   **Web Hosting:** The attacker needs access to a web server to host the malicious file or to inject the malicious file in a compromised website
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker might need to employ social engineering techniques to persuade users to open the disguised HTML files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects multiple AV products, including ESET, AhnLab, AntiVir, AVG, ClamAV, DrWeb, eSafe, eTrust, Ewido, Fortinet, Ikarus, K7AntiVirus, NOD32, Norman, Panda, PCTools, Prevx1, Rising, Sophos, Sunbelt, Symantec, TheHacker, TrendMicro, VBA32, ViRobot and VirusBuster.
*   **Browser Vulnerability:** The exploit takes advantage of how Internet Explorer 6 and 7 handle and execute HTML files, even if they have a non-HTML extension, indicating that is a browser related issue as well.
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided proof of concept (POC) outlines how to add the MZ header, change the file extension, and then serve it on a web server.
*   **"Magic of Magic Byte"**: The method is based on the technique called "magic of magic byte", further developed to bypass AV software.
