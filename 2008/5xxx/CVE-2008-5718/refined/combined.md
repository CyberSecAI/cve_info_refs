1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements
for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low
profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on
our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- apache-jakarta-tomcat-connectors
Two old but not yet fixed security issues in tomcat5 were spotted and
are fixed by this update:
CVE-2006-3835: Apache Tomcat 5 before 5.5.17 allows remote attackers
to list directories via a semicolon (;) preceding a filename with
a mapped extension, as demonstrated by URLs ending with /;index.jsp
and /;help.do.
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in certain applications
using Apache Tomcat allowed remote attackers to inject arbitrary
web script or HTML via crafted "Accept-Language headers that do not
conform to RFC 2616".
These issues were rated "low" by the Apache Tomcat team.
Affected products: SLES9

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement
is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into
a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all
over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to
the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You
can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end
of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: update on CVE-2008-5718

Hi,
I just did a security update for CVE-2008-5718 and since the
description is not really verbose I thought I'd share what I
found in case anyone else is working on that.

This issue only affects netatalk installations that make use
of a pipe command to handle the print file and also use one
of the available variables in the piped command.

The netatalk documentation documents %F, %U and %J while
there is also %C which is undocumented but visible in the
code (and does the same as %J).

These variables are expanded, %F with the content of %%From:, %J with
%%Title: from the PostScript stream and %U with the user
printing the file.

After the variable expansion (which is done in
pipexlate(lp.c) the specified,expanded command is passed to
popen() without properly escaping it before.

So exploiting this is pretty straight forward if you know
the papd configuration (which is at least world-readable on
Debian) just by for example preparing a ps file including
something like %%Title: $(yourcommand) and print it.

Steve, can you update the CVE id description according to
this information?

Cheers
Nico
P.S. The patch I used can be found on:

Package        : netatalk
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitising
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2008-5718
Debian Bug     : 510585

It was discovered that netatalk, an implementation of the AppleTalk
suite, is affected by a command injection vulnerability when processing
PostScript streams via papd.  This could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.  Please note that this only affects installations that are
configured to use a pipe command in combination with wildcard symbols
substituted with values of the printed job.

For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.3-4+etch1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny) this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0.3-11+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4~beta2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your netatalk package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------
