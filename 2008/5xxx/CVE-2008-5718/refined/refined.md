Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-5718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data within the `netatalk` package, specifically in the `papd` daemon when handling print jobs with pipe commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The `papd` daemon allows the use of format specifiers (%F, %U, %J, %C) in pipe commands. These specifiers are replaced with data extracted from the PostScript print stream or user information. However, the expanded commands are passed to `popen()` without proper escaping, allowing for arbitrary command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious shell commands into the print stream, which will then be executed by the server with the privileges of the `papd` process. This can lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker would need to send a specially crafted PostScript file to a `netatalk` server that is configured to use a pipe command for printing.
- **PostScript Stream Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a PostScript file that includes malicious code in the `%%From:` or `%%Title:` fields, depending on which variable is used in the pipe command configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send print jobs to a `netatalk` server.
- **Knowledge of Configuration:** The attacker needs to know the server's `papd` configuration to construct the malicious PostScript file. The configuration is world-readable on Debian systems, which makes the attack easier.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
- The provided text gives a deeper technical insight into how the vulnerability occurs in the code. It details the expansion of the format specifiers and the subsequent use of `popen()` without proper escaping. It also highlights how to exploit this vulnerability by using the `%%Title:` or `%%From:` fields in the PostScript file, and details the availability of the configuration which is important for this to be exploited.
