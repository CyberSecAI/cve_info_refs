Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5213:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an insecure MySQL query within the `featured_article.php` file of the AJ Article 1.0 application. The application fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in a database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary MySQL code/queries on the database server.
- Specifically, the provided exploit demonstrates how to extract the usernames and passwords of administrators. The extracted information could be used to gain unauthorized administrative access to the application.
- The vulnerability allows for partial confidentiality, integrity and availability impact according to the CVSS score information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker does not need local access to the server.
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `featured_article.php` script.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `artid` parameter within the URL is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Basic HTTP Request Skills:** The attacker needs the ability to craft HTTP requests to inject SQL code.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `featured_article.php` script of the AJ Article 1.0 application.
- The provided exploit URL is:
  `http://site.com/featured_article.php?mode=detail&page=search&artid=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,3,4,CONCAT(0x3C666F6E7420636F6C6F723D22726564223E,username,char(58),admin_password,0x3C2F666F6E743E),6,7,8,9,10,11,12/**/FROM/**/admin/*`
- The SQL injection uses a `UNION` statement to add a new row to the result set that contains the sensitive information from the `admin` table.
- The `CONCAT` function is used to format the extracted username and password within the HTML.
- The attacker is able to retrieve admin credentials as cleartext.

**Additional Notes:**
- The admin login page is located at `/admin/`.
- The vendor has not been notified as of the disclosure date.
- The vulnerability was discovered on May 12, 2008.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- Base Score: 7.5/10
- Exploitability Subscore: 10/10
- Impact Subscore: 6.4/10
- Attack Complexity: Low
- Authentication: Not Required
- Confidentiality Impact: Partial
- Integrity Impact: Partial
- Availability Impact: Partial
