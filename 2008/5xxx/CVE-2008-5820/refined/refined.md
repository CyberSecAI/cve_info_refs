Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-5820:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `eDNews_view.php` file of the eDNews 2.0 application. Specifically, the `newsid` parameter from the `$_REQUEST` array is used directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the insecure handling of user-supplied data in the `newsid` parameter.
- The code snippet shows the vulnerable lines:
   ```php
    if ( isset( $_REQUEST['newsid'] ) ) {
        ${$CONFIG['fld_id']} = $_REQUEST['newsid'];
   }
   ...
    $where = $CONFIG['fld_id'].' = '.${$CONFIG['fld_id']};
   ```
   This shows that the value from `$_REQUEST['newsid']` is directly included into the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries.
- Potential impacts include:
    - **Data Breach:** Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive information from the database.
    - **Database Manipulation:** Modifying database structure, potentially leading to application instability.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has sufficient privileges, an attacker may be able to gain control of the system.
    - **Information Disclosure:** Extract sensitive database information like usernames, passwords, or other data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `newsid` parameter in the URL.
- The exploit example is provided as: `http://site.com/eDNews_view.php?newsid=-99/**/union/**/select/**/1,2,concat(user(),0x3a,version(),0x3e,database()),4,5/*`
   -  This injects a SQL `UNION SELECT` query, which retrieves database information like the current user, version, and database name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **No Prior Authentication:** No prior authentication or knowledge of the application other than its URL is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit string demonstrates how to inject a SQL `UNION` query to retrieve sensitive information from the database.
- The vulnerable code uses a variable variable `${$CONFIG['fld_id']}` which could further complicate the analysis of the vulnerability in a real scenario but its value is used directly to compose the SQL query.
- The exploit string includes comments `/**/` and `/*` which demonstrates the attacker's attempt to avoid sanitization checks that might be present.
