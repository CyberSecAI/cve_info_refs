Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-5288:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw found in the `header.php` file of FAQ Manager 1.2. The `config_path` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include a remote file.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation on the `config_path` parameter in the `header.php` file. This allows for arbitrary file inclusion, which is a classic vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can remotely include and execute arbitrary code on the server. This allows for a wide range of attacks, including:
    *   Remote code execution (RCE).
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Installation of malware.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP request targeting the vulnerable `header.php` file, passing the malicious URL via the `config_path` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. No prior authentication is needed.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `include/header.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `config_path`
*   **Exploit Example:** `http://localhost/script/include/header.php?config_path=ZoRLu.txt?`

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as a medium risk with a CVSS base score of 6.8/10.
*   The exploit is straightforward and can be carried out remotely without any authentication required.
*   Exploit details and references are available on sites like Exploit-DB, Milw0rm and Secunia.
* The vulnerability was discovered by ZoRLu.

**Summary of Findings**
This vulnerability is a classic Remote File Inclusion (RFI) that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server by including external files through the `config_path` parameter. This poses a significant risk because it allows for a wide range of attacks.
