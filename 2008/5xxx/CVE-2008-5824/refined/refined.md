{
  "CVE-2008-5824": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "security-tracker.debian.org",
      "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in msadpcm.c in libaudiofile in audiofile 0.2.6 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted WAV file."
    },
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The allocated buffer size for decoding MS ADPCM data in libaudiofile's `msadpcm.c` was insufficient, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow.",
     "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (application crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted WAV file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted WAV file that triggers the overflow during processing by an application using the vulnerable libaudiofile library. This could be a remote attack if an application automatically processes user-provided files."
