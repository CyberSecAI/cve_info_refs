  "cveId": "CVE-2008-5032",
  "related": true,
  "summary": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in VLC media player when parsing malformed CUE files.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the `cdrom.c` module where the VLC media player parses CUE files. Specifically, the code iterates through track entries and stores sector information in a stack-based array `p_sectors`. The number of tracks is determined by parsing the input file, but a check to prevent exceeding the bounds of `p_sectors` array is missing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow due to unbounded array writes."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running VLC media player.",
    "attackVectors": {
      "userInteraction": "User interaction is required to open a specially crafted CUE image file.",
      "network": false
    },
     "attackerCapabilities": {
        "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious CUE file with a large number of track entries. The attacker must then entice a user to open the malicious CUE file with a vulnerable version of VLC.",
        "attackerPosition": "The attacker can be remote since the vulnerability is triggered when opening the malicious CUE file."
