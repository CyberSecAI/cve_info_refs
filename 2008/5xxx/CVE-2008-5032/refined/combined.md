# Security Advisory 0810

```

Summary           : Buffer overflows in VLC RealText and CUE demuxers
Date              : November 2008
Affected versions : VLC media player 0.9.5 down to 0.5.0
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-0810
CVE reference     : CVE-2008-5032, CVE-2008-5036

```
## Details

When parsing the header of an invalid CUE image file
or an invalid RealText subtitle file,
stack-based buffer overflows might occur.

## Impact

If successful,
a malicious third party could trigger execution of arbitrary code
within the context of the VLC media player.

## Threat mitigation

Exploitation of this issue requires the user
to explicitly open a specially crafted file.

## Workarounds

The user should refrain from opening files from untrusted third parties
or accessing untrusted remote sites (or disable the VLC browser plugins),
until the patch is applied.

Alternatively, the VCD and Subtitles plugins
(`libvcd_plugin.*` and `libsubtitle_plugin.*`)
can be removed manually from the VLC plugin installation directory.
However, this will **prevent use of subtitle files**
and Video CD altogether.

## Solution

VLC media player 0.9.6 addresses this issue.
Patches for older versions are available
from the official VLC source code repository 0.9-bugfix branch.

## Credits

These vulnerabilities were reported by Tobias Klein.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Advisory: VLC media player cue Processing Stack Overflow
Vulnerability
Advisory ID: TKADV2008-012
Revision: 1.1
Release Date: 2008/11/05
Last Modified: 2008/12/20
Date Reported: 2008/11/03
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: VLC media player < 0.9.6
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Vendor URL: http://www.videolan.org/
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
CVE-ID: CVE-2008-5032
Patch development time: 2 days
======================
Vulnerability details:
======================
The VLC media player contains a stack overflow vulnerability while parsing
malformed cue files. The vulnerability may be exploited by a (remote)
attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of VLC media player.
==================
Technical Details:
==================
Source code file: modules\access\vcd\cdrom.c
[...]
913 /\* Try to parse the i\_tracks and p\_sectors info so we can just forget
914 \* about the cuefile \*/
915 if( i\_ret == 0 )
916 {
917 [1] int p\_sectors[100];
918 int i\_tracks = 0;
919 int i\_num;
920 char psz\_dummy[10];
921
922 [2] while( fgets( line, 1024, cuefile ) )
923 {
924 /\* look for a TRACK line \*/
925 if( !sscanf( line, "%9s", psz\_dummy ) ||
926 strcmp(psz\_dummy, "TRACK") )
927 continue;
928
929 /\* look for an INDEX line \*/
930 [3] while( fgets( line, 1024, cuefile ) )
931 {
932 int i\_min, i\_sec, i\_frame;
933
934 [4] if( (sscanf( line, "%9s %2u %2u:%2u:%2u", psz\_dummy, &i\_num,
935 &i\_min, &i\_sec, &i\_frame ) != 5) || (i\_num != 1) )
936 continue;
937
938 [5] i\_tracks++;
939 [6] p\_sectors[i\_tracks - 1] = MSF\_TO\_LBA(i\_min, i\_sec, i\_frame);
940 msg\_Dbg( p\_this, "vcd track %i begins at sector:%i",
941 i\_tracks - 1, p\_sectors[i\_tracks - 1] );
942 break;
943 }
944 }
[...]
[1] This stack buffer can be overflowed
[2] + [3] User controlled data from the cue file is stored in "line".
[4] The user controlled file data is parsed and copied into "i\_min",
"i\_sec" and "i\_frame"
[5] The "i\_tracks" counter gets incremented
[6] The user controlled data from "i\_min", "i\_sec" and "i\_frame" is copied
into the stack buffer "p\_sectors" while "i\_tracks" is used as an array
index. As "i\_tracks" has no upper limit it is possible to overflow the
"p\_sectors" stack buffer by specifying a large number of tracks in the
cue file.
As the data that gets written beyond the stack buffer (a combination of
"i\_min", "i\_sec" and "i\_frame") can only be controlled to some extend (see
the "MSF\_TO\_LBA" macro) exploitation of this vulnerability is not trivial
and may even be impossible.
=========
Solution:
=========
See "Workarounds" and "Solution" sections of the VideoLAN-SA-0810 [1].

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: VideoLAN security advisory 0810

Summary           : Buffer overflows in VLC RealText and CUE demuxers
Date              : November 2008
Affected versions : VLC media player 0.9.5 down to 0.5.0
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-0810
CVE reference     : None yet.

- Details -

When parsing the header of an invalid CUE image file or an invalid RealText
subtitle file, stack-based buffer overflows might occur.

- Impact -

If successful, a malicious third party could trigger execution of arbitrary
code within the context of the VLC media player.

- Threat mitigation -

Exploitation of this issue requires the user to explicitly open a specially
crafted file.

- Workarounds -

The user should refrain from opening files from untrusted third parties or
accessing untrusted remote sites (or disable the VLC browser plugins), until
the patch is applied.
Alternatively, the VCD and Subtitles plugins (libvcd_plugin.* and
libsubtitle_plugin.*) can be removed manually from the VLC plugin
installation directory. However, this will prevent use of subtitle files and
Video CD altogether.

- Solution -

VLC media player 0.9.6 addresses this issue. Patches for older versions are
available from the official VLC source code repository 0.9-bugfix branch.

- Credits -

These vulnerabilities were reported by Tobias Klein.

Could you split that up into two CVE ids? I ask because the
realtext issue doesn't affect versions < 0.9.x which is the
case for the version we have in Debian so I can not use a
fixed version + not-affected for one CVE id in our security
tracker.

Kind regards
Nico

# VLC: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200812-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities in VLC may lead to the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/vlc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.8a** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.8a** |

### Background

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

### Description

Tobias Klein reported the following vulnerabilities:

* A
  stack-based buffer overflow when processing CUE image files in
  modules/access/vcd/cdrom.c (CVE-2008-5032).
* A stack-based
  buffer overflow when processing RealText (.rt) subtitle files in the
  ParseRealText() function in modules/demux/subtitle.c
  (CVE-2008-5036).
* An integer overflow when processing RealMedia
  (.rm) files in the ReadRealIndex() function in real.c in the Real
  demuxer plugin, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2008-5276).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted CUE
image file, RealMedia file or RealText subtitle file, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.9.8a"
```
