      "root_cause": "The root cause is a race condition in the `rmtree` function within the `File::Path` Perl module. The function first gathers a list of files/directories to remove, and then it proceeds with the removal process. The vulnerability arises because an attacker can manipulate the file system between the listing and the removal, causing incorrect files or directories to be removed.",

        "Local access to the system"
