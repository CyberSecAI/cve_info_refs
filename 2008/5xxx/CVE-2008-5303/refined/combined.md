Subject: perl-modules: File::Path::rmtree removes arbitrary
Date: Thu, 23 Dec 2004 10:00:00 +1100
```
Package: perl-modules
Version: 5.6.1-8.7
Severity: critical
File: /usr/share/perl/5.6.1/File/Path.pm
Tags: security
Justification: root security hole

Following on from the "File::Path::rmtree makes setuid" issue, I notice
that rmtree may be tricked into removing arbitrary files.

Example of attack: suppose we know that root uses rmtree to clean up
/tmp directories. Attacker prepares things:

  mkdir /tmp/psz
  perl -e 'open F, ">/tmp/psz/$_" foreach (1..1000)'
  touch /tmp/psz/passwd

While root is busy working on /tmp/psz (and this can be made as slow as
we like), attacker does:

  mv /tmp/psz /tmp/dummy
  ln -s /etc /tmp/psz

Root will then remove /etc/passwd.

Maybe it should be documented that rmtree must only be used if you can

 .
   * SECURITY [CAN-2005-0448]: rewrite File::Path::rmtree to avoid race

     remove arbitrary files (closes: #[286905](bugreport.cgi?bug=286905), #[286922](bugreport.cgi?bug=286922)).  Supersedes
     the previous patch for CAN-2004-0452.
 .
   * Add PERL_DEBUGGING_MSTATS for debugperl (closes: #[178243](bugreport.cgi?bug=178243)).
   * Escape dashes in verbatim text to have groff render them as-is
     rather than as \x{2010} (closes: #[250877](bugreport.cgi?bug=250877)).
 .
   * CGI: handle escaped newlines in URLs (closes: #[289709](bugreport.cgi?bug=289709)).

   * Remove XSI-isms from maintainer scripts (closes: #[256731](bugreport.cgi?bug=256731)).
   * Revise MakeMaker patch to defer expansion of $(MANnEXT) until
     runtime (closes: #[263325](bugreport.cgi?bug=263325)).
 .
   * Normalise case of a2p man page OPTIONS section, place optional
     filename in brackets (closes: #[281091](bugreport.cgi?bug=281091), #[281092](bugreport.cgi?bug=281092)).
 .
   * Fix octal glitch in perlreref(1) (closes: #[281437](bugreport.cgi?bug=281437)).

As discussed around

 <http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/perl/porters/233695#233695>

[CVE-2005-0448](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-0448) (File::Path::rmtree races) has resurfaced and is present
in all of etch, lenny, and sid.

To be precise, [CVE-2005-0448](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-0448) was about two bugs (#286922 and #286905).
Both of those apply to the etch package, while only #286905 applies to
the lenny/sid package.

I'm unsure if this needs a new CVE id.

For etch, I see no option but to reintroduce the File::Path::rmtree()
implementation by Brendan O'Dea originally introduced in 5.8.4-7. I'm
attaching the diff (debian/patches/03_fix_file_path from 5.8.7-x).
I have informed the security team and they will look at this.

For lenny/sid, #286922 is fixed and the attached patch combined from
File-Path-2.07 and

 <http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/perl/porters/233699#233699>

should fix #286905. Please note that the above message seems to have
the CVE ids confused; I think [CVE-2004-0452](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-0452) is really fixed for good.

I'll upload 5.10.0-18 with the patch at urgency=high soon, hope it can
make it into lenny without a separate testing-security package.

I'd love more eyeballs on this. I've been able to exploit the issues
with breakpoints in the perl debugger and the patches seem to work.

# USN-700-2: Perl regression

15 January 2009

Perl regression

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [perl](/security/cves?package=perl) -

## Details

USN-700-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Perl. Due to problems with the Ubuntu

8.04 build, some Perl .ph files were missing from the resulting update.

This update fixes the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Jonathan Smith discovered that the Archive::Tar Perl module did not

correctly handle symlinks when extracting archives. If a user or

automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted tar file,

a remote attacker could over-write arbitrary files. ([CVE-2007-4829](/security/CVE-2007-4829))

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that Perl did not correctly

handle certain utf8 characters in regular expressions. If a user or

automated system were tricked into using a specially crafted expression,

a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial

of service. Ubuntu 8.10 was not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-1927](/security/CVE-2008-1927))

A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module's rmtree

function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user's call

of rmtree, they could create arbitrary setuid binaries. Ubuntu 6.06

and 8.10 were not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-5302](/security/CVE-2008-5302))

A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module's rmtree

function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user's call of

rmtree, they could delete arbitrary files. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected

by this issue. ([CVE-2008-5303](/security/CVE-2008-5303))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [perl](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/perl)
  -
  [5.8.8-12ubuntu0.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/perl/5.8.8-12ubuntu0.4)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [libarchive-tar-perl](/security/cves?package=libarchive-tar-perl) -
* [perl](/security/cves?package=perl) -

## Details

Jonathan Smith discovered that the Archive::Tar Perl module did not

correctly handle symlinks when extracting archives. If a user or

automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted tar file,

a remote attacker could over-write arbitrary files. ([CVE-2007-4829](/security/CVE-2007-4829))

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that Perl did not correctly

handle certain utf8 characters in regular expressions. If a user or

automated system were tricked into using a specially crafted expression,

a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial

of service. Ubuntu 8.10 was not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-1927](/security/CVE-2008-1927))

A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module's rmtree

function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user's call

of rmtree, they could create arbitrary setuid binaries. Ubuntu 6.06

and 8.10 were not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-5302](/security/CVE-2008-5302))

A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module's rmtree

function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user's call of

rmtree, they could delete arbitrary files. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected

by this issue. ([CVE-2008-5303](/security/CVE-2008-5303))

One point yet -- this is perl-5.8.8-1+ specific issue (different than
CVE-2004-0452, CVE-2005-0448 and even different than recently fixed
CVE-2008-2827). Seems that upstream forgot to apply the fix for
CVE-2005-0448 to 5.8 perl after rebase. This newly reported issue
already fixed in perl-5.10.

CVE-2008-2827 affects only perl-5.10 (and it already applies additional
fix to CVE-2005-0448, which has been properly applied in perl-5.10).

Regards, Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: perl-modules: File::Path::rmtree makes setuid
Date: Thu, 23 Dec 2004 09:10:31 +1100
```
Package: perl-modules
Version: 5.6.1-8.7
Severity: critical
File: /usr/share/perl/5.6.1/File/Path.pm
Tags: security
Justification: root security hole

Noting USN-44-1 e.g. in

  <http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2004-12/0385.html>

I looked in perl-N.N.N/lib/File/Path.pm and noticed that rmtree contains
a race condition, allowing creation of setuid files:

   170          (undef, undef, my $rp) = lstat $root or next;
   171          $rp &= 07777;   # don't forget setuid, setgid, sticky bits
   172          if ( -d _ ) {
   ...
   209              if (rmdir $root) {
   210                  ++$count;
   211              }
   212              else {
   213                  carp "Can't remove directory $root: $!";
   214                  chmod($rp, ($Is_VMS ? VMS::Filespec::fileify($root) : $root))
   215                      or carp("and can't restore permissions to "
   216                              . sprintf("0%o",$rp) . "\n");
   217              }
   218          }
   ...

Example of attack: suppose we know that root uses rmtree to clean up
/tmp directories. Attacker prepares things:

  mkdir -p /tmp/psz/sh
  perl -e 'open F, ">/tmp/psz/sh/$_" foreach (1..1000)'
  chmod 4777 /tmp/psz/sh

While root is busy working on /tmp/psz/sh (and this can be made as slow
as we like), attacker does:

  mv /tmp/psz/sh /tmp/psz/dummy
  ln -s /bin/sh /tmp/psz/sh

Root would have recorded the permissions of /tmp/psz/sh, but would
"restore" it to /bin/sh.

I am not sure if things can almost be fixed (for those architectures
without $force_writeable) by enclosing the chmod($rp,...) line within
if(!safe|$force_writeable){...}. Maybe it should be documented that
rmtree must only be used if you can be sure to have exclusive access to
the tree.

(A few minutes ago I emailed the File::Path authors Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk
and bailey@newman.upenn.edu; Tim.Bunce bounced.)

Thanks Paul,

both of these issues obviously stem from the same root cause--a race
between generating a list of files, then manipulating that list.

I don't really see that this is fixable outside of rewriting rmtree to
recursively chdir+readdir+unlink.

Given that there are possible pitfalls even with this approach (cf.
[CVE-2002-0435](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2002-0435)) I'm considering punting the problem to fileutils,
replacing rmtree entirely with the attached subroutine.

[p5p:] If anyone had a cleaner (and cross-platform) fix, I'd love to
hear of it.

--bod

sub rmtree
{
    my ($p, $verbose) = @_;
    $p = [] unless defined $p and length $p;
    $p = [ $p ] unless ref $p;
    my @paths = grep defined && length, @$p;

    unless (@paths)
    {
	carp "No root path(s) specified\n";
	return 0;
    }

    local *RM;
    my $pid = open RM, '-|';

    unless (defined $pid)
    {
	carp "Can't fork ($!)\n";
	return 0;
    }

    unless ($pid)
    {
	# need to parse output, ensure it's not localised
	delete $ENV{$_} for grep /^(LC_|LANG(UAGE)?$)/, keys %ENV;

	exec '/bin/rm', '-rvf', @paths
	    or croak "Can't exec /bin/rm ($!)\n";
    }

    my $count = 0;
    while (<RM>)
    {
	if ($verbose)
	{
	    chomp;
	    s/'$//;

	    if (s/^removed directory: `//)
	    {
		print "rmdir $_\n";
	    }
	    elsif (s/^removed `//)
	    {
		print "unlink $_\n";
	    }

	    $count++;
	}
    }

    close RM;

    $count;
}

```

How does this relate to the Debian patch 22_fix_file_path
for CAN-2004-0452 ? which I'm pasting below.

That said, an implementation of rmtree() that uses /bin/rm
isn't suitable for inclusion in perl itself.

<http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/p/perl/perl_5.6.1-8.8.diff.gz>
[Adapted from Chip Turner's 5.8.0 patch]
Fix for CAN-2004-0452.  Change chmod's to make files writable/executable
by the current user only and not by the entire world.  chmod's necessary
in the first place but at least this makes them less dangerous.  If, for
some reason the rm process dies halfway through, at worst some files and
dirs were revoked from others, not made available.

The first issue "also" relies on Path.pm trying to be clever:

	    # notabene: 0777 is for making readable in the first place,
	    # it's also intended to change it to writable in case we have
	    # to recurse in which case we are better than rm -rf for

That pitfall is known and easily avoided by double-checking inodes.

I am not sure that all platforms have fileutils: no -v option on rm.
(Tru64 doesn't.)

CAN-2004-0452 exploited the "chmod 0777", the fix changed the mode
to 0700 (and 0666 to 0600) but did not avoid the race.

I'll discuss this one, below with my reply to Brendan.

As a general response: the solution to this and any number of other
vulnerabilities is a system that presents filesystem multi-stage
transactions. That's not something Perl can rely on, but it's certainly
something Perl should support when it does exist (perhaps Reiser has
already gone there?)

Ok, now back to reality:

You cited a general solution, and it's a good one. You have to chdir
into the directory and then readdir, restoring state as you go back up.

You also need to sanity check using Cwd and File::Spec before and after
the chdir to make sure that you didn't get hijacked.

Well, certainly relying on rm (and you assumed a "-v" option which,
AFAIK implies GNU rm specifically) is right out. I'm sure others will
say the same.

Also, I don't see the value in changing permissions.

I understand WHY you want to do this, but it's far better to tell the
programmer calling rmtree that they might have to fix permissions before
calling rmtree. Otherwise, rmtree is doing exactly what your permissions
told it to, and you might have done that for a reason. Is it any worse
to have a developer say, "I made that directory read-only to all, but
rmtree nuked it!" vs. "I made that directory read-only to all, and
rmtree didn't nuke it!"? I can make that argument either way with just
as much sincerity and "oh my gods, you can't do this to me!" pleading as
I'm sure you've heard on this in the past... solution: punt.

Quick fix? Reduce the race by making any changes just before and just
after an operation, not in preparation for a whole directory. Now you
still have a problem, but a smaller one.

Further reduce the problem by using device/inode information from stat
on platforms where it is available. You can't make this atomic, but when
you need to do:

        make_change();
	if (! do_something()) {
		revert_change();
	}

checking just before revert_change() will reduce the race substantially.
Also, consider writing sanity-checking wrappers that handle all of this,
so that future additions don't have to boiler-plate your security code.

Sure, it was proposed as a quick hack for the Debian package, where it
is safe to assume /bin/rm is from GNU coreutils.

If it weren't for the requirement to retain the current API (returning
the number of deletions, and verbose output) then a thin wrapper around

  system 'rm', '-rf', @paths

would suffix for POSIX systems.

A race is a race, no matter how small the window.

Hi. As this Bug is now lying around for more than one month I decided to
look into a fix. It is not a very beautiful one, it is only partially
tested and it only works for systems which can fork, so please look over it
before applying it.

The idea is to fork off a process, change into the directory, make sure the
directory has the same inode which was originally used, and then change
permissions. fchmod would have been much easier.

A diff follows:

Well actually, discussion doesn't rage at all as to how this should be
fixed.

Basically it's been acknowledged as a problem, but one that requires
more than a trivial patch to rmtree to correct, so as such is currently
languishing until such time as rmtree is rewritten to remove the race
condition.

I was kind of hoping that someone else would tackle that task since I
don't really regard myself as a security expert and did't want to make
the problem worse by introducing new, different security issues with a
recursive implementation.

However in the absence of any alternate suggestion, I've appended a
first-cut rmtree replacement.

For the moment I've ignored the third argument entirely; tempted to do
so permanently.

I've also ignored $Is_VMS and $Is_MacOS; will need some input from
perl5-porters as to what changes are required to support those
platforms.

     directories in the tree being removed to make files setuid or to
     remove arbitrary files (closes: #[286905](bugreport.cgi?bug=286905), #[286922](bugreport.cgi?bug=286922)).  Supersedes
     the previous patch for CAN-2004-0452.
 .
   * Add PERL_DEBUGGING_MSTATS for debugperl (closes: #[178243](bugreport.cgi?bug=178243)).
   * Escape dashes in verbatim text to have groff render them as-is
     rather than as \x{2010} (closes: #[250877](bugreport.cgi?bug=250877)).
 .
   * CGI: handle escaped newlines in URLs (closes: #[289709](bugreport.cgi?bug=289709)).
   * Net::NNTP: fix precedence error in article routine (closes: #[275142](bugreport.cgi?bug=275142)).
   * Devel::Dprof: refer to executable as `perl' (closes: #[198855](bugreport.cgi?bug=198855)).
   * Remove spurious undefined warning in getopts.pl (closes: #[255919](bugreport.cgi?bug=255919)).
   * Remove XSI-isms from maintainer scripts (closes: #[256731](bugreport.cgi?bug=256731)).
   * Revise MakeMaker patch to defer expansion of $(MANnEXT) until
     runtime (closes: #[263325](bugreport.cgi?bug=263325)).
 .
   * Normalise case of a2p man page OPTIONS section, place optional
     filename in brackets (closes: #[281091](bugreport.cgi?bug=281091), #[281092](bugreport.cgi?bug=281092)).
 .
   * Fix octal glitch in perlreref(1) (closes: #[281437](bugreport.cgi?bug=281437)).
   * Have perl suggest both ReadLine variants (gnu, perl).
   * Upgrade suggestion on perl-doc to recommends now that dselect is
     less pedantic about the latter.

As noted on debian-security:

#286905 fixes CAN-2005-0448 for testing's perl (5.8.4-7), however it
leaves it unfixed in stable's version (5.6.1-8.8), which is also
affected (according to <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/12767>), so
this bug should not be closed.

As discussed around

 <http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/perl/porters/233695#233695>

[CVE-2005-0448](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-0448) (File::Path::rmtree races) has resurfaced and is present
in all of etch, lenny, and sid.

To be precise, [CVE-2005-0448](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-0448) was about two bugs (#286922 and #286905).
Both of those apply to the etch package, while only #286905 applies to
the lenny/sid package.

I'm unsure if this needs a new CVE id.

For etch, I see no option but to reintroduce the File::Path::rmtree()
implementation by Brendan O'Dea originally introduced in 5.8.4-7. I'm
attaching the diff (debian/patches/03_fix_file_path from 5.8.7-x).
I have informed the security team and they will look at this.

For lenny/sid, #286922 is fixed and the attached patch combined from
File-Path-2.07 and

 <http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/perl/porters/233699#233699>

should fix #286905. Please note that the above message seems to have
the CVE ids confused; I think [CVE-2004-0452](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-0452) is really fixed for good.

I'll upload 5.10.0-18 with the patch at urgency=high soon, hope it can
make it into lenny without a separate testing-security package.

I'd love more eyeballs on this. I've been able to exploit the issues
with breakpoints in the perl debugger and the patches seem to work.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1678-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Steffen Joeris

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : perl
Vulnerability  : design flaws
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-5302 CVE-2008-5303
Debian Bug     : 286905 286922

Paul Szabo rediscovered a vulnerability in the File::Path::rmtree
function of Perl. It was possible to exploit a race condition to create
setuid binaries in a directory tree or remove arbitrary files when a
process is deleting this tree.  This issue was originally known as
CVE-2005-0448 and CVE-2004-0452, which were addressed by DSA-696-1 and
DSA-620-1. Unfortunately, they were reintroduced later.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.8.8-7etch5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.0-18 and will migrate to the testing distribution (lenny)
shortly.

We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
