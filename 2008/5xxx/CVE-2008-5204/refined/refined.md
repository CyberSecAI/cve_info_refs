    {
      "cve": "CVE-2008-5204",
      "type": "Local File Inclusion",
      "root_cause": "The application uses a GET parameter 'lang' in multiple PHP files without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious file paths.",
       "weaknesses": [
          "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary files on the server, which could lead to system compromise, disclosure of sensitive information, or code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request to vulnerable PHP files (e.g., agb.php, index.php) with a manipulated 'lang' parameter."
      ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the application. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."

      "cve": "CVE-2008-5204",
      "type": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "root_cause": "The application uses a GET parameter 'l_vote_done' in `external_vote.php` without proper sanitization or encoding. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.",
      "weaknesses": [
          "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "HTTP GET request to `external_vote.php` with a manipulated `l_vote_done` parameter."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the application and needs to be able to trick a victim into accessing the malicious link."
