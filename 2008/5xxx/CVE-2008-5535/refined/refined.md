{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the way multiple antivirus products analyze web pages, which can be bypassed by adding an MZ header to HTML files, changing the extension or removing the extension, and serving the file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple vendor anti-virus software has flawed detection mechanisms for malicious web pages.  Specifically, they don't properly analyze files with an MZ header (which is a DOS executable header), when used with HTML content and a different extension, or no extension.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Bypassing the detection of malicious web pages, leading to potential compromise of a user's system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Serving a specially crafted HTML file with an MZ header via a web server and having a victim access it with IE6/7. The malicious HTML content will be executed, even if it has a .txt extension or no extension. ",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to serve a specially crafted HTML file on a web server, and the victim must visit that web page using IE6/7."
