Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5665:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw in the `xhresim` module for XOOPS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The module is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `no` parameter in the `index.php` file. This is due to improper sanitization or handling of user-supplied input in the `no` parameter, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive database information, including usernames, passwords, and potentially other data stored in the database.
- **Potential for Data Manipulation:** Depending on database permissions, the attacker might also be able to modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable through a specially crafted GET request to the `index.php` file of the `xhresim` module, specifically by manipulating the `no` parameter.
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** The exploit examples provided show that the attacker can append SQL injection code directly to the `no` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable XOOPS installation.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL syntax to craft successful injection attempts, including using `UNION SELECT` statements to retrieve data.
- **No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required, implying the vulnerability may be remotely exploitable without prior authentication.**

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit examples show how an attacker can use the `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique to extract database information:
  -  `http://scriptpage.com/modules/xhresim/index.php?no=9999+union+select+0,concat(uname,0x3a,pass),2,3+from+xoops_users--` demonstrates how to extract usernames and passwords from the `xoops_users` table.
  - `http://www.sakakusu.net/saka/modules/xhresim/index.php?no=75+union+select+0,convert(database()%20using%20latin1),2,convert(user()%20using%20latin1)--` demonstrates how to extract the database name and current user.
