User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031213
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031213
In CSS, \0 means a null character. But it is ignored by Mozilla.
(ex. "c\0olor:red;" is treated as "color:red;".)
BTW, a raw null character in CSS is treated correctly as null
by Mozilla.
(ex. "c\*olor:red;" (\*=null character(x00)) is not treated as
"color:red".)
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Actual Results:
\0 in CSS is ignored.
Expected Results:
\0 in CSS is treated as a null character. (equal to a raw null
character)
This \0 ignoring has possibility to avoid sanitizing of web application (webmail
etc.).
Internet Explorer executes JScript in CSS so \0 can be a vulnerability.

Though Mozilla does not executes JavaScript in CSS (so far as I know),
it can use for web bug easily. (ex. @i\0mport )

<http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#q6> says (third bullet):
"Third, backslash escapes allow authors to refer to characters
they can't easily put in a document. In this case, the backslash
is followed by at most six hexadecimal digits (0..9A..F), which
stand for the ISO 10646 ([ISO10646]) character with that number.
If a character in the range [0-9a-zA-Z] follows the hexadecimal
number, the end of the number needs to be made clear. There are
two ways to do that:
1. with a space (or other whitespace character): "\26 B" ("&B").
In this case, user agents should treat a "CR/LF" pair (13/10)
as a single whitespace character.
2. by providing exactly 6 hexadecimal digits: "\000026B" ("&B")
"
AFAICT, the two ways mentioned above to write zero is:
c\0 olor: red;
c\000000olor: red;
which means that your example has an illegal unicode escape sequence.
The question is, shouldn't this property name fail to parse in this case?Severity: normal → minorKeywords: [qawanted](/buglist.cgi?keywords=qawanted&resolution=---)OS: Windows 98 → All

I think I remember seeing a comment in www-style: there's a typo in the CSS21
spec. That paragraph should read:
"If a character in the range [0-9a-fA-F] follows the hexadecimal
number, the end of the number needs to be made clear"
In other words, you only need a space if the end of the escape is ambiguous
(e.g., 'eat\0food'). 'c\0olor' is unambigous and (as far as I can see) valid.

Mats:

Yes. I think not to ignore \0 or \000000 specially.
\0 or \000000 should be unescaped to a null character as well as other
backslash escapes, even if it breaks the property name.

I don't fully understand the previous comment, but I'd note that CSS 2.1 (even
the current WD) doesn't place any restrictions on identifier names,
specifically: "In CSS 2.1, identifiers ... can also contain ... any ISO 10646
character as a numeric code".

To Malcom.
I'm sorry that I confused you. I could not explain my thought in
English well.
(Also, I may misunderstand the opinion of Mats.)
It is certain that I misused the word, "specially".
My opinion is only that \0 and \000000 in CSS should not be ignored
by Mozilla.
Other backslash escaped characters aren't ignored by Mozilla.
A raw null character isn't ignored too.
Only \0 and \000000 are ignored. It is strange behavior.
I used "specially" to intend to point out the difference.Hardware: All → PC

I think the problem is basically here:
<http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/content/html/style/src/nsCSSScanner.cpp#75>
9
746 PRBool nsCSSScanner::GatherIdent(nsresult& aErrorCode, PRInt32 aChar,
747 nsString& aIdent)
...
758 if (aChar == CSS\_ESCAPE) {
759 aChar = ParseEscape(aErrorCode);
760 if (0 < aChar) {
761 aIdent.Append(PRUnichar(aChar));
762 }
We don't append the unescaped character if it's NUL. AFAICS, this is only
because ParseEscape overloads its return value so that zero means either 'no
character' or 'ASCII NUL'.
In ParseEscape, 'No character' is used only once (line 730), which deals with
<backslash><newline>. Oddly, <backslash> at the end of the stream will return
<backslash> (line 674). I can't see that ParseEscape will ever return zero
otherwise, except where a legitimate NUL is escaped.
So, it would help if we changed ParseEscape to return -1 for 'no character' in
the <bs><nl> case (unless Ian has any better ideas) -- line 730 of
nsCSSScanner.cpp.
However, the output is written to an nsString, which (IIRC) is a zero-
terminated string. I think it would be 'unhappy' if it contained a NUL
character.
So to fix this, we'd need to:
1. Change lines that check the return value of ParseEscape to allow a zero
return to mean 'NUL' -- lines 632, 752, 760 (as above), 954.
2. Write the output into something that can accept NULs.
3. Change consumers to use that 'something'.
As well as identifiers, this also affects \0 in url's and quoted strings. I
don't know what the effects might be of allowing NUL's into strings further up
the chain, though.

Ian: any chance you could suggest that the NUL character (escaped or unescaped)
should be disallowed (ignored?) in CSS files entirely? :)
Seriously, I can't see any good reason for allowing it, and it sounds like a
nightmare to implement. Backwards compatibility with CSS1/CSS2 might be one
reason, but I doubt any existing CSS parsers handle the situation correctly.

I don't really see that it should be disallowed, although admittedly I see very
few reasons for allowing it.

Actually, maybe an nsString can contain NUL characters after all?
<http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xpcom/string-guide.html#Concrete_Classes> says
it's NUL-terminated, but the implementation has a length count, so maybe it can.

It can't contain null characters. We should probably just put in 0xfffd.

Not that it would matter in the real world, but that would technically make us
non-compliant since the following two rules would become equivalent:
.t\0 est { ... }
.t\fffd est { ... }
...both matching:
<div class="t&#xFFFD;est"></div>
...and neither matching:
<div class="t&#x0000;est"></div>
But on the other hand, that would never matter in the real world.

Any fix for this should probably also take into account the embedded NUL case
([attachment 137653](/attachment.cgi?id=137653 "testcase of raw null") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=137653&action=edit "testcase of raw null")). At the moment, I suspect we parse '.c<NUL>olor' as '.c'.
I don't think there's any way to allow NUL characters (escaped or not) without
also breaking something else. dbaron's [comment 16](/show_bug.cgi?id=228856#c16 "VERIFIED FIXED - [FIX] \0 in CSS is ignored") sounds like a sensible
compromise.

David, I think you're wrong regarding nsString -
it handles embedded NUL characters just fine.
This bug is caused by three separate problems.
1. nsCSSScanner::ParseEscape returns zero to indicate it
found an escaped newline (that the caller should ignore).
2. nsCSSValue and nsStyleContentData uses PRUnichar\* which
results in truncation at the first embedded NUL.
3. CSS class and property names are Atomized but nsAtomTable
and pldhash.c doesn't handle strings/keys with embedded NULs
(in fact truncates them so "col\0or" matches "col").
This patch fixes 1. and 2.

This changes the return value of ParseNumber from PR\_FALSE to PR\_TRUE in the

Why the changes from nsAutoString to nsString here? You should be able to
initialise an nsAutoString from a nsAString.

No, it doesn't. The old ParseEscape() returns zero for this case and it
was rightly ignored by both the cited removed tests. The new version
of ParseEscape() now returns -1 for this case and it's still ignored.
(Please note that the old ParseEscape() never returned negative values
at all, so the removed |return PR\_FALSE| is just dead code elimination.)
Also note that the cited code is in nsCSSScanner::GatherString() and not
in nsCSSScanner::ParseNumber() - this is probably "cvs diff -pu" not being
very good at parsing C++. (I have not changed ParseNumber at all).
You are right about the behaviour though - both the old and new version
fails on <bs><nl> when a number is expected but AFAICT this is not a bug.
This <bs><nl> syntax is only allowed for strings, see:
<http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#q6>
> You should be able to initialise an nsAutoString from a nsAString.
Yes, but I believe nsString(nsString& x) is more efficient than
nsAutoString(nsString& x).

1. changed nsAString\* to nsString\* in the nsStyleContentData struct.
2. I discovered an additional embedded NUL problem; in the special parsing
of the "class" HTML attribute value. (function ParseClasses() in
file content/html/style/src/nsHTMLAttributes.cpp)

Attached patch

[Patch2 rev. 1 (XPCOM)](attachment.cgi?id=138245&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=138245&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=228856&attachment=138245)

This is the XPCOM part of the fix.
The changes to nsStaticCaseInsensitiveNameTable are straightforward,
(we save a pointer in NameTableEntry).
The nsAtomTable changes are trickier, mostly because I wanted to keep
the type nsStaticAtom as is. I used the same ptr|0x1 trick that is
already used to mark a "wrapped atom". I had to add a 32 bit length
field to nsAtomImpl though.
I also want to point out an unrelated bug I found while experimenting
with different solutions. At one point I had added a member to
nsStaticAtomWrapper and that caused crashes because data was overwritten:
- PL\_ARENA\_ALLOCATE(mem, gStaticAtomArena, sizeof(nsStaticAtom));
+ PL\_ARENA\_ALLOCATE(mem, gStaticAtomArena, sizeof(nsStaticAtomWrapper));
If anyone can give me some feedback on the performance of this patch
that would be appreciated. I do see a couple of things that can be
done to improve performance a bit more if this patch is accepted.

Technically nsString doesn't allow embedded null characters, even if they work,
since nsString is-a nsAFlatString, which has a get method.

Regarding the <bs><nl> syntax; We support it for identifiers as
well as for strings, eg .na\
me is parsed as .name but I can't find anything in the CSS2.1 spec. regarding
this, is this just an oversight in the spec. or is it a bug?

If it were followed by something that wasn't a hex digit, it would escape that
character, not tokenise as DELIM.

Attached patch

[new minimally invasive fix; doesn't quite work](attachment.cgi?id=343767&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=343767&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=228856&attachment=343767)

All the patches on here are quite invasive and no longer applicable to trunk, so here's a minimum-necessary-change fix versus moz-central, that hopefully can go on many of the live branches, either as is or with adjustment for churn. It modifies nsCSSScanner::ParseAndAppendEscape and nothing else; and what it does is apply the \-<any character other than a hex digit> rule to \0, so e.g. "\000" is equivalent to "000". Note that this is \*not\* what Mats' test cases expect; they expect \0 (any form) to be equivalent to a literal NUL, but that is clearly forbidden by CSS2.1 section 4.1.3 ("[the number] must not be zero").
There are two reftests in here. One checks for \*exactly\* the behavior I coded, inside strings. The other began as Mats' testcase #5 but no longer bears any resemblance; it checks all the cases I could think of where a \0 or literal NUL character should prevent a style rule from matching. Four out of the umpteen subcases of this test fail; these constructs
#id.\0 { color: red }
.cl#\0 { color: red }
are matching <div id="id" class="&#0;"> and <div class="cl" id="&#0;"> respectively, but it seems like they shouldn't. If I could get a little help with that, we could maybe put this one to bed soon.
(I regret that some of the new files are uuencoded and thus not inspectible in-browser. They contain embedded NULs.)Assignee: mats.palmgren → zweinberg

Are the class and ID attributes in those cases what you expect them to be? If so, are we using string comparison functions for the matching in question that don't handle embedded NULs?

It turns out the test failures were just because of errors in the test itself. I had accidentally reused class and ID names, so rules that were meant for other subcases were matching the problem subcases. I did some experiments using JS to check on the attribute values, and they are coming out the way they're supposed to.

By reading this bug report, I was under the impression this could be used as a hack to specifically target Gecko (like the IE underscore or star hacks).
If anyone thought the same and actually used it on their site, then backporting this patch to branches might be a bad idea.

A couple of casual web searches reveals a number of people asking whether any such hack exists, but nobody (that I saw) describing this as a hack to target Gecko; and in my opinion we should backport the patch, because the possibility of malicious people using the bug to sneak CSS past a filter is of greater concern. I've got a tested 1.9.0.x branch patch now and will have a 1.8.0.x branch patch shortly.

[patch for 1.9.0.x branch](attachment.cgi?id=345026&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=345026&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=228856&attachment=345026)

Here's the patch for 1.9.0.x. Beware raw NUL characters in the diff; after applying it you should make sure that the files layout/reftests/bugs/228856-2.html and layout/reftests/bugs/228856-2-ref.html are byte-for-byte identical to the files of the same name that currently exist in mozilla-central. It's probably too late for this to make 1.9.0.4 but I'm flagging it for that release anyway - it \*is\* a security issue and it's a low-risk patch IMO. 1.9.0.x's reftests pass with the patch applied.

Attached patch

[patch for 1.8.1.x (MOZILLA\_1\_8\_BRANCH)](attachment.cgi?id=345028&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=345028&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=228856&attachment=345028)

Here's the patch for 1.8.1.x. Again, I'm flagging for approval for .18 and .19 despite expecting that this won't make .18, because this is a relatively safe fix for a security issue. There are no reftests on MOZILLA\_1\_8\_BRANCH so this patch, unlike the others, does not include tests. I intended to manually test it, but I got link errors below gfx/ due to some sort of problem with freetype. The modified file itself compiles fine.
I'm assuming this doesn't need fixed in 1.8.0.x (Firefox 1.5) but I'll do it if someone wants.

Verified for 1.9.0 since I see the new tests passing. Is there a good way to verify for 1.8? The manual testcases above don't turn all green in either 1.9.0 or 1.8 (though they turn more green and the results are consistent between 1.9.0 and 1.8).Keywords: [fixed1.9.0.5](/buglist.cgi?keywords=fixed1.9.0.5&resolution=---) → [verified1.9.0.5](/buglist.cgi?keywords=verified1.9.0.5&resolution=---)

By 'manual testcases' you mean the first four attachments to this bug and the sixth? The behavior as finally agreed upon is not what those expect. You can use the reftests from the m-c patch as manual testcases - <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/9f05f41462ee/layout/reftests/bugs/228856-2.html> (should be all green except for headings) and <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/9f05f41462ee/layout/reftests/bugs/228856-1-ref.html> (compare to <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/9f05f41462ee/layout/reftests/bugs/228856-1-ref.html> )
I don't remember if either of those tests needs other CSS features not available in 1.8, though.

Thanks, Zack. Those both seem to work and it looks good in 1.8.1.19: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.19pre) Gecko/2008120103 BonEcho/2.0.0.19pre.

Do you need me to revise the patch for 1.8.0 or is it good as is?

The CSS Syntax Level 3 draft defines two points that were undefined in CSS 2.1:
\* Any U+0000 NULL character in the CSS source is replaced with U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.
<http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-syntax/#preprocessing-the-input-stream>
\* Any hexadecimal escape sequence such as \0 that evaluate to zero produce U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER rather than U+0000 NULL
<http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-syntax/#consume-an-escaped-character>
With this behavior, the result of parsing never contains a NULL character, but anything involving NULL does not produce a know identifier such as a property name.
Does this spec behavior address the security concern of this issue, or should we change the spec to something else?Flags: needinfo?

That's not the behavior we implemented here, but I believe it will serve equally well from the security standpoint. The concern was that
.foo { c\0olor: red }
might skate through someone's XSS filter and then get treated as
.foo { color: red }
... upgrading that to a genuine exploit left as an exercise. :)
It's my intention to change Gecko's behavior to match Syn3 once it's CR. In a new bug.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

# USN-701-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

6 January 2009

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. If a user had Javascript

enabled, these problems could allow an attacker to crash Thunderbird and

possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-5500](/security/CVE-2008-5500))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that the same-origin check in Thunderbird could be

bypassed by utilizing XBL-bindings. If a user had Javascript enabled, an

attacker could exploit this to read data from other domains. ([CVE-2008-5503](/security/CVE-2008-5503))

Marius Schilder discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle redirects

to an outside domain when an XMLHttpRequest was made to a same-origin resource.

When Javascript is enabled, it's possible that sensitive information could be

revealed in the XMLHttpRequest response. ([CVE-2008-5506](/security/CVE-2008-5506))

Chris Evans discovered that Thunderbird did not properly protect a user's data

when accessing a same-domain Javascript URL that is redirected to an unparsable

Javascript off-site resource. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious

website and had Javascript enabled, an attacker may be able to steal a limited

amount of private data. ([CVE-2008-5507](/security/CVE-2008-5507))

Chip Salzenberg, Justin Schuh, Tom Cross, and Peter William discovered

Thunderbird did not properly parse URLs when processing certain control

characters. ([CVE-2008-5508](/security/CVE-2008-5508))

Kojima Hajime discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle an escaped

null character. An attacker may be able to exploit this flaw to bypass script

sanitization. ([CVE-2008-5510](/security/CVE-2008-5510))

Several flaws were discovered in the Javascript engine. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had Javascript enabled, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary Javascript code within the context of another

website or with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5511](/security/CVE-2008-5511), [CVE-2008-5512](/security/CVE-2008-5512))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [2.0.0.19+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/2.0.0.19%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [2.0.0.19+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/2.0.0.19%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [2.0.0.19+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.7.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/2.0.0.19%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.7.10.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Thunderbird to effect

the necessary changes.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2008-67

## Escaped null characters ignored by CSS parser

Announced
December 16, 2008
Reporter
Kojima Hajime
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.19
* Firefox 3.0.5
* SeaMonkey 1.1.14
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.19

### Description

**Kojima Hajime** reported that unlike literal null
characters which were handled correctly, the escaped form '`\0`'
was ignored by the CSS parser and treated as if it was not present in
the CSS input string. This issue could potentially be used to bypass
script sanitization routines in web applications. The severity of
this issue was determined to be low.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. These problems could allow

an attacker to crash the browser and possibly execute arbitrary code with user

privileges. ([CVE-2008-5500](/security/CVE-2008-5500))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that the same-origin check in Firefox could be

bypassed by utilizing XBL-bindings. An attacker could exploit this to read data

from other domains. ([CVE-2008-5503](/security/CVE-2008-5503))

Several problems were discovered in the JavaScript engine. An attacker could

exploit feed preview vulnerabilities to execute scripts from page content with

chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5504](/security/CVE-2008-5504))

Marius Schilder discovered that Firefox did not properly handle redirects to

an outside domain when an XMLHttpRequest was made to a same-origin resource.

It's possible that sensitive information could be revealed in the

XMLHttpRequest response. ([CVE-2008-5506](/security/CVE-2008-5506))

Chris Evans discovered that Firefox did not properly protect a user's data when

accessing a same-domain Javascript URL that is redirected to an unparsable

Javascript off-site resource. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious

website, an attacker may be able to steal a limited amount of private data.

([CVE-2008-5507](/security/CVE-2008-5507))

Chip Salzenberg, Justin Schuh, Tom Cross, and Peter William discovered Firefox

did not properly parse URLs when processing certain control characters.

([CVE-2008-5508](/security/CVE-2008-5508))

Kojima Hajime discovered that Firefox did not properly handle an escaped null

character. An attacker may be able to exploit this flaw to bypass script

sanitization. ([CVE-2008-5510](/security/CVE-2008-5510))

Several flaws were discovered in the Javascript engine. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to execute

arbitrary Javascript code within the context of another website or with chrome

privileges. ([CVE-2008-5511](/security/CVE-2008-5511), [CVE-2008-5512](/security/CVE-2008-5512))

Flaws were discovered in the session-restore feature of Firefox. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to

perform cross-site scripting attacks or execute arbitrary Javascript code with

chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5513](/security/CVE-2008-5513))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [2.0.0.19+nobinonly1-0ubuntu0.7.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/2.0.0.19%2Bnobinonly1-0ubuntu0.7.10.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox to effect the

necessary changes.
