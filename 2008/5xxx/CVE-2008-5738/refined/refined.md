Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5738:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure cookie handling in the Calendar Script v1.1. Specifically, after a successful login, the script sets a cookie named 'nodstrumCalendarV2' with a hardcoded value of '1'.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Cookie Handling**: The cookie value is static and predictable. It does not use any unique user information, such as the password or user ID, which could prevent unauthorized access if the cookie is intercepted.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass authentication by setting the cookie value to '1' in their browser, without knowing a valid username/password. This would effectively grant them access as an authenticated user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through client-side manipulation, specifically via JavaScript. An attacker can set the cookie by running the provided JavaScript exploit.
- `javascript:document.cookie = "nodstrumCalendarV2=1; path=/";`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to execute JavaScript on the client side in the context of the vulnerable website, or be able to set the cookie manually.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided exploit sets the cookie with the path attribute set to `/`. This ensures that the cookie is valid for any location on the vulnerable website.
- A fix was suggested by the author which involved setting the cookie to the password value instead of a static value.
- The exploit provided is client-side.
