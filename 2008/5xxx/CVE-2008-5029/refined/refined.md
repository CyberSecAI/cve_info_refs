{
  "CVE-2008-5029": {
    "description": "The __scm_destroy() function in net/core/scm.c in the Linux kernel could make indirect recursive calls to itself. This could potentially lead to a denial of service issue.",
    "root_cause": "The `__scm_destroy` function, responsible for cleaning up socket control messages, could recursively call itself through a call to the `fput` function, creating a stack overflow and leading to a kernel panic.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Recursive function call without proper exit conditions.",
      "Improper handling of file descriptors in socket control messages."
    ],
    "impact": "Local denial of service (kernel panic).",
    "attack_vector": "Local exploit by sending crafted SCM_RIGHTS messages over a Unix domain socket and then closing the file descriptors.",
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access with the ability to create and manipulate Unix domain sockets."
  }
