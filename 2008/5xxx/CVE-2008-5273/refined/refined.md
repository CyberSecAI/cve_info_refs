Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5273:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `viewnews.asp` script of Todd Woolums ASP News Management 2.2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `newsID` parameter in the `viewnews.asp` script is vulnerable to SQL injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access sensitive data within the database. This is demonstrated by the provided exploit that uses `union select` to extract data (e.g., table names from `msysobjects`).
*   **Potential for further attacks:** By gaining access to the database, attackers can potentially escalate privileges, modify data, or inject malicious code.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `viewnews.asp`, injecting SQL code into the `newsID` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server hosting Todd Woolums ASP News Management 2.2.
*   No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details**

*   The exploit uses the following payload structure within the `newsID` parameter: `8+union+select+name+from+msysobjects` for direct SQL injection, to retrieve data.
*   A blind SQL injection method is also demonstrated to bypass limitations: `IIF((select%20mid(last(Name),1,1)%20from%20(select%20top%2010%20Name%20from%20MSysObjects))='a',0,'Bingo')%00`
