# Textpattern CMS 4.0.6 released

02 February 2008

After quite a while and lots of work from many, many people it’s finally here. We have fixed no less than six security issues. Because half of those can be used from the public side, updating is strongly recommended.

Updates should be seamless for the vast majority of people, otherwise make sure that all plugins are also updated to their most recent version, especially admin-side plugins.

### Changes since 4.0.5

* Safer use of [txp\_login cookie + nonce](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/advisories/wordpress-cookie-auth.txt) (**note:** users are logged out after upgrading!)
* Fixed [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) vulnerability (thanks DSecRG) and input validation in setup script.
* Fixed [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) vulnerability and parameter value overflow in comments preview (thanks DSecRG)
* Added missing escape in SQL query (admin side)
* Fixed local file include vulnerability (publisher only) in textpattern/index.php (thanks DSecRG and Victor)
* Fixed escape request method as shown on logs tab (thanks Victor)
* New translations: Croatian, Korean, Português (Brasil), Serbian (Latin + Cyrillic), Turkish and Vietnamese
* New tags: `<txp:if_search_results>` and `<txp:search_term />`.
* `<txp:thumbnail />` allows non-JS links to the full-size image
* `<txp:article_custom />` allows comma-separated lists for category, section and author attributes (thanks Manfre)
* `<txp:linklist />` allows comma-separated list for category attribute
* `<txp:file_download_list />` allows comma-separated list for category attribute
* `<txp:recent_articles />` allows comma-separated lists for category and section attribute
* `<txp:related_articles />` allows comma-separated list for section attribute
* `<txp:search_result_excerpt />` allows a custom `break`attribute defaulting to an ellipsis
* Several tags have been deprecated and will be replaced automatically during the upgrade: `<txp:sitename />`, `<txp:request_uri />`, `<txp:s />`, `<txp:c />`, `<txp:q />`, `<txp:id />`, `<txp:pg />`
* Added ‘password reset’ functionality (with confirmation email) on the login screen
* Update to jQuery 1.2.2 as a default JavaScript library
* Fixed Textile list incompatibility with PHP 5.2.4 (and higher)
* Fixed `http-auth` when using Lighttpd or (mostly) Apache + fastCGI
* Fixed HTTPS protocol check for ISAPI with IIS
* Fixed use of article tags on a sticky article page
* Speed improvements (less SQL queries needed)
* Pages, sections and styles can no longer be accidentally deleted if they are used on other tabs
* Corrections in the tag builder
* Refrain from showing sticky articles from non-frontpage sections in search results
* Enable separate search section for messy URL mode
* Plugin developers should note that using `add_privs()` for admin-side plugins is now required (used to be optional for publisher-only plugins) and the included HISTORY.txt contains other useful information.
* Many, many minor improvements

Digital Security Research Group [DSecRG] Advisory #DSECRG-08-008
Application: Txp CMS
Versions Affected: 4.0.5
Vendor URL: http://www.textpattern.com
Bugs: DOS, multiple XSS, etc.
Exploits: YES
Reported: 11.01.2008
Vendor response: 14.01.2008
Patch Released: 03.02.2008
Date of Public Advisory: 04.02.2008
Authors: Alexandr Polyakov, Stas Svistunovich
Digital Security Research Group [DSecRG] (research [at] dsec [dot] ru)
Description
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
Textpattern system has multiple security vulnerabilities:
1. Parameter Value Overflow
2. Linked XSS
3. XSS in POST
4. Stored XSS
5. Insecure password changing algorithm
Details
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
1. Parameter Value Overflow
Vulnerability found in script index.php in comments section. Post parameter "message".
The application does not ensure that the parameter value length. It can be used for performing a DOS attack.
Example:
message = [A]x10000
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
2. Linked XSS vulnerability found in /textpattern/setup/index.php, attacker can inject XSS in URL string.
Example:
http://[server]/[installdir]/textpattern/setup/index.php/"><script>alert
('DSecRG XSS')</script>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
3. XSS in POST
Vulnerability found in script index.php in comments section. Post parameter "name".
Example:
name = <img src="javascript:alert('DSecRG XSS')">
name = <script>alert('DSecRG XSS')</script>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
4. Stored XSS
Vulnerability found in script textpattern/index.php?event=article in post parameter "Body".
Example:
Body = <IMG SRC=javascript:alert("DSecRG\_XSS")>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
5. Insecure password changing algorithm
Previous password not required to set a new password.
If attacker gain access to admin session by using XSS vulnerability, he can change admin password without knowing old password.
It will be more secure to ask old password when changing password or primary email.
