{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to insecure handling of the 'objectname' parameter in the `rpc.php` file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The application includes files based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization.",
      "The application uses `eval()` on user-controlled input.",
     "The `objectName` parameter is not sanitized"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server using LFI and execute arbitrary PHP code through RCE.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to `rpc.php` with a crafted 'objectname' parameter for LFI.",
      "HTTP GET request to `rpc.php` with a crafted 'objectname' parameter containing PHP code for RCE."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `rpc.php` file.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in `gravity-gtd` version 0.4.5 and below. The vulnerable code snippet is in `library/setup/rpc.php` which takes the value of the 'objectname' parameter and uses it in an include statement and eval statement. An attacker can use directory traversal to access sensitive files (such as `/etc/passwd`) or execute php code by including code such as `Xmenu();phpinfo();die`"
