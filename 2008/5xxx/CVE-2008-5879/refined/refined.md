Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-5879:

**Vulnerable Software:** phpclanwebsite <= 1.23.3 Fix Pack #5

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Multiple File Inclusion Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Direct access to certain files, bypassing the intended logic of the application, allows for the redefinition of internal variables passed as arguments to the `include()` function.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Unsanitized user-controlled input used in file inclusion.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** By manipulating the `boxname` parameter in `/theme/superchrome/box.php` or the `theme` parameter in `/phpclanwebsite/footer.php`, an attacker can include arbitrary files from the server, such as `/etc/passwd`.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints with manipulated parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive information disclosure, potentially leading to complete server compromise if arbitrary code can be included.
    *   **Note:** This vulnerability requires `register_globals=On` and `magic_quotes_gpc=Off` in PHP configuration.

2.  **Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for SQL injection attacks.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization and parameterized queries.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Insert:**  By injecting SQL code into the `page` parameter in `/index.php`.
        *   **Delete:** By injecting SQL code into the `form_id` parameter in `/index.php?page=processforms&ok=1&SP=1`.
        *  **Select (Login):** By injecting SQL code into the `pcwlogin` or `pcw_pass` POST parameters in `/index.php?page=login`.
        *  **Select (Search):** By injecting SQL code into the `searchvalue` or `whichfield` POST parameters in `/index.php?page=downloads&func=search`.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints with manipulated parameters.
    *  **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, potential access to sensitive information.
    *   **Note:** Most SQL injection vulnerabilities, except the one in the `whichfield` parameter, require `magic_quotes_gpc` to be disabled.

3.  **Multiple Cross-site Scripting Vulnerabilities (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of client-side scripts.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper encoding/escaping of user-supplied data.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**  By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `page` parameter in `/index.php`.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints with manipulated parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the context of the victim's browser, which can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or malware delivery.

**Summary of Impacts:**
The vulnerabilities described allow for:

*   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** leading to potential disclosure of sensitive information or complete server compromise.
*   **SQL Injection:** allowing unauthorized database access, modification, or deletion of data.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** leading to client-side attacks against users of the web application.
