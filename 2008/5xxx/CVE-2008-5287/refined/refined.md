Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5287:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `cat_id` parameter in the `categorie.php` script. Specifically, the script directly uses the `$_GET['cat_id']` value in an SQL query without any input validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `cat_id` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including admin credentials (`admin_name`, `admin_pass` in the provided example).
- **Data Manipulation:** It could also be possible to modify or delete data in the database, depending on the database user's privileges.
- **Complete compromise:** In the worst case scenario it could lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack vector is through the `cat_id` GET parameter in the `categorie.php` script's URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through a web browser or any tool that can send HTTP requests.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker requires a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
- **Network Access:** They need network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet in `categorie.php` shows that the `cat_id` parameter is directly used in a `mysql_query` without sanitization.
- The provided proof of concept URL demonstrates a SQL injection attack using a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve admin credentials from the `faq_admin` table:
`http://[host]/[faq_manager_path]/catagorie.php?cat_id=3+union+select+1,2,concat_ws(0x3a,admin_name,admin_pass),4,5+from+faq_admin/*`
