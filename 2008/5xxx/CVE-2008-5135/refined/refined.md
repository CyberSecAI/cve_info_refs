Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which aligns with the information about symlink attacks in /tmp directory.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insecure use of temporary files created in the `/tmp` directory by various scripts within Debian packages. Specifically, the scripts create temporary files with predictable names in `/tmp` and then interact with those files (e.g., writing, reading, moving, or removing). If a user can create a symlink with the same name as the temporary file before the script runs, the script will operate on the target of the symlink, potentially leading to file system manipulation outside of the intended scope.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Temporary File Names:** Many scripts use easily predictable names for temporary files in `/tmp`. For instance, names with patterns such as `/tmp/HACK`, `/tmp/nws.debug`, `/tmp/ppp-errors`, `/tmp/arb_pids_*`, `/tmp/mmp$$`, and many others, are used.
*   **Lack of Proper File Handling:** The scripts fail to verify the type of the file before operating on it, therefore not checking whether they are operating on a file, a directory or a symlink.
*   **Insecure Directory:** The `/tmp` directory is publicly writable by all users, meaning any user can create symlinks in this directory and point to a system-critical file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Attackers can create symlinks in `/tmp` with the same name as the temporary file used by the vulnerable scripts. When the script runs, it would operate on the file or directory that the symlink is pointing to instead of a temporary file in `/tmp`. This can lead to the overwriting or modification of sensitive files, leading to denial of service, privilege escalation and system compromise.
*   **Arbitrary File Removal:** Similar to the above, some scripts use commands such as `rm -f` on temporary files in `/tmp`. If a symlink exists, this can lead to arbitrary file removal.
*   **Data Disclosure:** If a script is writing temporary data to a file in `/tmp`, a symlink can redirect this data to a file controlled by the attacker.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If a script runs with elevated privileges, and its file operation are redirected to a target file, an attacker could potentially overwrite files which could lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Other arbitrary operations:** Due to the variety of operations such as `pipe`, `chmod`, `chown`,  `append` and `mv` being redirected through the symlink, arbitrary file system operations can be performed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local User Access:** Any local user on the system can exploit this vulnerability by creating the necessary symlinks before the vulnerable scripts are executed.
*   **Timing Attacks:** Some attacks might rely on the timing between the creation of the temp file and operation by the vulnerable script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** An attacker needs a local user account on the target system to create symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Scripts:** The attacker needs to know which scripts are vulnerable and what temporary file names they use.

**Packages Affected (from the list provided):**

The list of vulnerable packages includes, but may not be limited to:

*   mplayer
*   nws
*   ppp
*   twiki
*   arb
*   newsgate
*   libalps-bin
*   netdisco-mibs-installer
*   cman
*   nvidia-cg-toolkit
*   osdsh
*   os-prober
*   netmrg
*   xcal
*   tkusr
*   tkman
*   mysql-client-5.1
*   libpam-mount
*   libmyspell-dev
*   jailer
*   ltp
*   mafft
*   mailscanner
*   gpsdrive
*   flamethrower
*   dist
*   crip
*   freebsd-sendpr
*   apertium
*   aview
*   fwbuilder
*   mgetty-fax
*   mindi
*   multi-gnome-terminal

**Additional Notes:**

* The email thread indicates that the `os-prober` package is deemed safe due to using `mktemp -d` which should create a unique temporary directory. However the initial report identified it as vulnerable with predictable filenames. This indicates that not all instances of the vulnerability might be fixed in this mail thread.
* The email thread suggests a potential mass bug filing for the issue but this specific issue (CVE-2008-5135) does not cover all of the packages listed, however all of the issues are related to the symlink vulnerability in `/tmp`.
* The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, providing specific vulnerable packages and file names.
