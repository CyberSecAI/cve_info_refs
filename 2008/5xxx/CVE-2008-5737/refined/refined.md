Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5737

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `index.php` file of Calendar Script v1.1. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query within the authentication mechanism. Specifically, the username is not escaped before being placed into the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates the user-provided username into the SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization using `mysql_real_escape_string()` (or similar functions).
- **Lack of Input Validation:**  The application does not properly validate or sanitize user inputs for SQL-related characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** A malicious user can bypass the login mechanism without providing a valid username and password.
- **Potential Data Breaches:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker could potentially retrieve, modify, or delete sensitive data from the application's database, depending on the database privileges associated with the application. This could include user credentials or other sensitive information stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed via the web login interface, specifically through the `index.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic understanding of SQL injection:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious SQL query injection.
- **No prior authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior access to the system.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code in `index.php` uses the following logic:

```php
$action = $_POST['action'];
switch($action) {
    case 'login':
        $username = stripslashes(trim($_POST['username']));
        $password = sha1(stripslashes(trim($_POST['password'])));
        if(empty($username) || empty($password)) {
            $loginMsg = 'You must enter a username and password';
        } else {
           $checkDetails = mysql_query("SELECT id FROM user WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password' LIMIT 1", $conn);
        }
}
```

The exploit provided uses the following inputs:

- Username: `' or 1=1#`
- Password: anything

This will result in a SQL query like:

```sql
SELECT id FROM user WHERE username='' or 1=1#' AND password='<sha1-hashed-anything>' LIMIT 1
```

The `1=1` condition will always evaluate to true, effectively bypassing authentication and allowing the attacker to log in as the first user found in the database. The `#` character comments out the rest of the query, preventing errors with the password check.

**Fix:**

The recommended fix is to escape the user input before using it in the query using `mysql_real_escape_string()`:

```php
$username = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['username']);
```
This ensures that any SQL-related characters are properly escaped, preventing SQL injection attacks.

**Additional notes**
The exploit works regardless of the php.ini settings.
The vulnerability is not just an authorization bypass, it's a SQL injection.
