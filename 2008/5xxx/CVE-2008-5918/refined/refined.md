Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-5918:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the unsafe usage of the `PHP_SELF` server variable within the `getParameterisedSelfUrl()` function in WebSVN's `index.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS flaw. Due to the insecure use of `PHP_SELF`, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL that will be executed within the user's browser when the page is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking: Stealing cookies to impersonate the user.
    *   Defacement: Altering the content of the page.
    *   Malware distribution: Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    *   Data theft: Accessing sensitive data displayed on the page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted URL that includes JavaScript code in place of the intended URL parameters.
*   The attacker can entice a user to click on the malicious URL or embed it on a website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker can be remote and doesn't need any special permissions.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and have a user load the page using it.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in WebSVN version 2.0 and earlier.
*   The content also describes other vulnerabilities affecting WebSVN that are associated with CVE-2008-5919 (File Handling Issues) and an arbitrary PHP Code Execution vulnerability, but these are not directly related to CVE-2008-5918.

**Summary**

CVE-2008-5918 is an XSS vulnerability in WebSVN caused by the unsafe usage of the `PHP_SELF` server variable. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript within the user's browser leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, malware distribution and data theft.
