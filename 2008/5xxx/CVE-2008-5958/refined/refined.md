Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `QuizID` parameter of the `questions.asp`, `importquestions.asp`, and `quiztakers.asp` pages of Active Test v2.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to Blind SQL injection attacks through the `QuizID` parameter. This type of injection makes it difficult to exploit, as no data is directly output on the page. However, by sending boolean expressions, an attacker can discover if they are true or false by observing changes in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database using boolean based SQL injections, possibly including user credentials, quiz data, and other information.
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to query the database, which can have various impacts depending on the data and functions they can access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable ASP pages (`questions.asp`, `importquestions.asp`, and `quiztakers.asp`) by manipulating the `QuizID` parameter with malicious SQL injection payloads.
- The attacker can use boolean conditions like `1=1` (true) and `1=2` (false) to determine the effect of their SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, and it can be triggered by a regular user of the application.
- The attacker requires knowledge of SQL to perform effective injection and extract data, though boolean-based injection can be achieved using readily available tools or methods.
