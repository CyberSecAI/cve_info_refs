# Attacking NFC mobile phones

First look at the security of NFC mobile phones

![](/congress/2008/Fahrplan/images/event-2639-128x128.png)

Near Field Communication (NFC) based services and mobile phones are starting to appear in the field, therefore it is time to take a look at the security of the services and especially the NFC mobile phones themselves.

The presentation will provide this first look at the security of NFC mobile phones. We will show some known theoretical attacks and how they may work in the field. Further we will present results from analyzing a specific NFC mobile phone, here we will reveal some security issues and methods to exploit them. Also we will provide a small survey of NFC applications in the field. Finally we will release a small set of tools to do further analysis on NFC mobile phones and applications.

If you have an NFC mobile phone I kindly ask you to bring it to the congress and come to me before or after my talk and show it to me, thanks!
