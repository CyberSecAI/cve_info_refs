      {
        "source": "jvn.jp_c4a7f964_20250125_202118.html",
        "root_cause": "Improper input validation leading to SQL injection.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "SQL injection"
        ],
        "impact": "A remote attacker could obtain administrative privileges of MODx.",
         "attack_vectors": [
          "Remote network access via crafted SQL queries in the MODx Control Panel."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable system. Authentication is required to reach the vulnerable functionality, but this is considered a low barrier.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction, but it requires some expertise and/or luck to successfully exploit, putting exploit complexity at low-medium."

      {
        "source": "jvndb.jvn.jp_72dbe667_20250126_114112.html",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is incorporated into SQL queries.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can manipulate SQL queries to bypass security restrictions, modify data, or gain unauthorized access. The impact varies based on the context, but can be severe.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Injection of malicious SQL code through user-controlled input fields that are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can inject malicious SQL code through web interfaces or other means where user input is processed. This usually requires knowledge of the applicationâ€™s data handling and query construction.",
          "additional_details": "The document describes SQL injection vulnerabilities generally and provides multiple examples. It details different types of attacks and defenses against them. It emphasizes that direct incorporation of user input into SQL queries without sanitization opens the application to SQL injection vulnerabilities, enabling attackers to potentially view, modify or delete data, and even execute commands on the database server. The document advocates for parameterized queries, input validation and other measures to mitigate SQL injection risks."

        "weaknesses": [
          "SQL Injection"

          "Attackers can inject SQL commands via the MODx control panel."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "Attackers require remote access to the application.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects MODx versions 0.9.6.2 and earlier. The report mentions that the vulnerability was reported to IPA, and JPCERT/CC coordinated with the developer."
