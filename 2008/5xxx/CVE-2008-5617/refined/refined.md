{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A coding error during modularization caused the `$AllowedSender` directive to be silently accepted but not honored.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `$AllowedSender` directive, which is intended to control which hosts can send messages, was not functioning.",
      "Lack of input validation or proper access control implementation."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to misleading log entries or a remote Denial of Service (DoS). A malicious sender could flood the system logs with messages, potentially filling the disk space.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending messages from unauthorized hosts.",
      "Flooding the system with log messages."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the rsyslog server. There are no details on if there is a need for authentication."

  "affected_versions": [
    "rsyslog 3.12.1 to 3.20.0",
    "rsyslog 4.1.0",

  "fixed_versions": [
    "rsyslog 3.20.2",
    "rsyslog 3.21.9",
    "rsyslog 4.1.2"
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The v2-stable branch was not affected. The vulnerability can be fully mitigated by moving the access control to the firewall level. This is recommended in any case, not just as a mitigation."
