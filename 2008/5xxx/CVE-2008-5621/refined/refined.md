{
  "CVE-2008-5621": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a combination of a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) bypass and a SQL Injection vulnerability. phpMyAdmin has a token-based CSRF protection mechanism, but certain request parameters like 'db' and 'table' are exempted from this protection. By manipulating these parameters in a crafted request, an attacker can bypass CSRF protection and inject malicious SQL code.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the webserver by injecting malicious SQL queries that write a PHP backdoor file on the server. This allows an attacker to gain control over the web application and potentially the entire server.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed via a crafted HTTP GET request, typically triggered when a victim's browser loads a malicious URL (e.g. an IMG tag). This crafted URL includes the vulnerable 'db' and 'table' parameters that contain the SQL injection payload.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know the URL of the phpMyAdmin installation. The victim needs to have an active, authenticated session with phpMyAdmin at the time of the attack. The attacker does not require any advanced user position and is a remote attacker."
