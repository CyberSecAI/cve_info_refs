Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5890:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `feeds.php` file of Injader CMS version 2.1.1.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`id` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- The application has `magic_quotes_gpc` turned off, and `register_globals` turned on, which can exacerbate security issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
- Complete database compromise: Depending on database permissions, the attacker could modify or delete data.

**Attack vectors:**
-  HTTP GET requests to `feeds.php` with a manipulated `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
-  No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerable URL is `http://localhost/upload/feeds.php?name=articles&id=<SQL>`.
- The provided SQL injection payloads for retrieving usernames and passwords demonstrate how to construct malicious queries:
  - Username: `2 UNION ALL SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, CONCAT(CHAR(0),IFNULL(CAST(username AS CHAR(10000)), CHAR(32)),CHAR(0)), NULL, NULL, NULL FROM maj_users# AND 2511=2511`
  - Password: `2 UNION ALL SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, CONCAT(CHAR(0),IFNULL(CAST(userpass AS CHAR(10000)), CHAR(32)),CHAR(0)), NULL, NULL, NULL FROM maj_users# AND 8758=8758`
