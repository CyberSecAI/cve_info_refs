Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5674 (based on the content from aluigi.altervista.org)

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in webcamXP when handling the `camnum` parameter within the `/pocketpc` and `id` parameter in `/show_gallery_pic` URIs. Specifically, the application does not check if the provided webcam number or ID is within the valid range of existing webcams.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Array out-of-bounds read:** By supplying large positive or negative values for `camnum` or `id`, an attacker can cause the application to read memory locations outside of the allocated array that holds webcam data.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** As a secondary effect, the application displays 8 bytes (two 32-bit numbers) of the process's memory in the "width" and "height" parameters of the returned HTML page when accessing the /pocketpc URI.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. The out-of-bounds memory access leads to an access violation, causing the service to crash. This is visible to the client as a silent interruption.
    *   **Partial Memory Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to read 8 bytes of the process's memory. This information disclosure is partial and somewhat arbitrary, since the array's base offset is fixed and the attacker can only jump by 6360 bytes.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploited through remote HTTP requests to the affected webserver.
    *   **Specific URIs:** The vulnerable URIs are `/pocketpc` and `/show_gallery_pic`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable webcamXP webserver.
    *   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to craft HTTP requests.
    *   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameters are `camnum` in the `/pocketpc` URI and `id` in the `/show_gallery_pic` URI.
*   The array offset for webcam data is at address `007196f0` in version 3.72.440.0.
*   Each webcam entry has a size of 6360 bytes.
*   The memory disclosure occurs in the `/pocketpc` URI by displaying two 32-bit numbers in the HTML parameters "width" and "height".
*   The vulnerability is present in webcamXP versions 3.72.440.0 and earlier and beta version 4.05.280 and earlier.
*   The provided exploits are:
    *   `http://SERVER:8080/pocketpc?camnum=999999&mode=0`
    *   `http://SERVER:8080/pocketpc?camnum=-999999&mode=0`
    *   `http://SERVER:8080/show_gallery_pic?id=999999`
