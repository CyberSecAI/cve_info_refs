{
  "CVE-2008-5031": {
    "Description": "Multiple integer overflows in Python have an unspecified impact. Chris Evans reported multiple integer overflows in the expandtabs method, as implemented by (1) the string_expandtabs function in Objects/stringobject.c and (2) the unicode_expandtabs function in Objects/unicodeobject.c.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the expandtabs method within stringobject.c and unicodeobject.c.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
     "Impact": "A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities in Python applications or daemons that pass user-controlled input to vulnerable functions. The security impact is currently unknown but may include the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Passing user-controlled input to the vulnerable expandtabs function"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to pass user controlled input to Python application or daemons."
