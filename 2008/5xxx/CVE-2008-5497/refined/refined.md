{
  "CVE-2008-5497": {
    "Description": "BandSite CMS 1.1.4 is vulnerable to insecure cookie handling. An attacker can forge a login_auth cookie and gain unauthorized access.",
    "Root cause": "The application does not properly validate or protect the `login_auth` cookie, allowing it to be easily forged.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Cookie Handling",
      "Authentication Bypass"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application by forging the `login_auth` cookie, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker manipulates the client-side cookie by injecting a javascript which sets a login_auth cookie with the value 'true'",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute Javascript on the user's browser. This can be done by intercepting the traffic of the target user or by exploiting a XSS vulnerability. The attacker does not need to have access to the server or the credentials of a user to perform this attack. "
