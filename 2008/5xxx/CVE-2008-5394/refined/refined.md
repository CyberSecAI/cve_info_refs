          "data": "This Debian bug report details a symlink attack vulnerability in the login program related to tty mis-determination and arbitrary file ownership, which was later assigned CVE-2008-5394. \n\nRoot cause of vulnerability:\nThe vulnerability stems from a race condition in the chowntty() function of login, where a symlink can be changed after the checks in is_my_tty() but before the chown() and chmod() operations.\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n1.  Incorrect utmp entry selection. The login program uses the process ID (PID) and type to select utmp entries, which can result in the selection of an incorrect entry, including those left over by other processes like Samba.\n2.  Insecure path handling within is_my_tty(): The function uses stat instead of lstat, which can be fooled by symlinks. Moreover, it only compares the rdev, which can be tricked with symlinks or hardlinks. The path itself is not scrutinized.\n3.  Race condition between the is_my_tty checks and the chown operation: A malicious user can exploit this by changing the symlink target after the checks in is_my_tty() pass but before chown() is called, causing login to change permissions of an unintended file.\n4. Unsafe path handling: login uses an unsafe path when calling chown/chmod, instead of fchown and fchmod. This makes it vulnerable to symlink races.\nImpact of exploitation: An attacker with group utmp privileges can elevate their privileges to root. This allows the attacker to change the ownership and permissions of arbitrary files, potentially including system files like /etc/shadow.\nAttack vectors: A local attacker that can write to the utmp database, or reuse unclosed entries, can perform a symlink race attack. \nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs write access to the utmp database, such as belonging to the utmp group, or able to reuse unclosed entries, and the ability to create and modify symlinks."

An attacker can manipulate a symlink after the check but before ownership change.\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n1. Symlink manipulation: The vulnerability arises from the ability to create a symlink, check it via `stat` and later change the target before the `chown`.\n2. Race condition: A critical time gap between symlink check and file ownership change allow the exploit.\nImpact of exploitation: Successful exploitation results in the ability to change ownership of arbitrary files, allowing privilege escalation to root.\nAttack vectors: Local exploitation via symlink manipulation using a custom utmp entry.\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs group utmp privileges to write crafted utmp entries and local access to execute the exploit."
