Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5766

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `download.php` script of FaUpload. Specifically, the `$id` variable, which is taken directly from the `$_GET['id']` parameter, is used unsanitized in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into a SQL query without any sanitization, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can read sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords (including those for the admin panel stored in `pconfig.php`), file names, and secret keys.
- **Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, the ability to inject SQL could potentially be leveraged to execute operating system commands via database features, depending on the specific database server configurations.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify data within the database, including the 'ads' table, potentially leading to defacement or other malicious modifications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a specially crafted `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and requires knowledge of SQL syntax. No authentication is required to trigger the SQL Injection.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Code:**
  ```php
  $id = $_GET['id'];
  $result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM file WHERE $kind LIKE '$id' order by id DESC");
  ```
- **Exploit Example:**
  ```
  http://127.0.0.1/faupload/download.php?id=-999'/**/union/**/select/**/1,load_file(0x2e2f61646d696e2f70636f6e6669672e706870),3,4,5,6,7,8,9/**/from/**/file/*
  ```
  This example demonstrates how an attacker can use SQL injection to read the content of the `admin/pconfig.php` file from the database.

  Another example to view usernames, passwords, file names and secret keys:

  ```
    http://127.0.0.1/faupload/download.php?id=-999'/**/union/**/select/**/1,name,3,4,5,6,skey,8,9/**/from/**/file/*
  ```
  This example demonstrates how an attacker can read the name and secret key from the file table.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit examples use MySQL specific functions `load_file()` suggesting the target database is MySQL.
- The provided information also mentions the possibility of uploading a shell, suggesting that attackers could gain full control over the server.
