Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5560

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection and Database Disclosure

**Root Cause:** The `sendcard.cfm` script in PostEcards is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `cid` parameter. Additionally, the database file `postcards.mdb` is directly accessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
   - Information Disclosure: The database file containing sensitive information is directly accessible through the webserver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
   - SQL Injection: Attackers can retrieve sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords, from the database. They can also potentially modify or delete data, leading to further compromise.
    - Database Disclosure: Direct access to the database file allows attackers to download and analyze the entire database contents.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - HTTP GET requests with malicious SQL injection strings in the `cid` parameter of the `sendcard.cfm` script
   - Direct access via web browser to the database file path `/database/postcards.mdb`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required to exploit the SQL Injection.
   - The attacker must know the direct path to the database file.

**Technical Details:**
  - SQL Injection example: `http://www.target.com/sendcard.cfm?cid=0+union+SELECT%20null,null,username,null%20FROM%20USERS%00`
  - Database disclosure: `http://www.target.com/database/postcards.mdb`
   - The vulnerable application is written in ASP.
