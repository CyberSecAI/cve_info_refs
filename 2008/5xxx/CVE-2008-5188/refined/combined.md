Subject: CVE request for ecryptfs

Hi,

While reviewing ecryptfs, I discovered an information disclosure
vulnerability in ecryptfs-setup-private and notified upstream. This
helper script was known as ecryptfs-setup-confidential in earlier
releases.

The problem arises when ecryptfs-setup-private invokes
ecryptfs-wrap-passphrase and ecryptfs-add-passphrase with command line
arguments that include the user's existing login password as well as the
newly created mount password. As a result, these passwords can be
snooped in the process table.

This script did not exist in ecryptfs before 45. The original script
(ecryptfs-setup-pam-wrapped.sh) referenced in [1] that formed the basis
for the scripts found in 45 is also vulnerable to this attack vector, so
anyone shipping any of these scripts is affected.

Upstream has fixed this in [2] (with a bugfix in [3]) by updating
ecryptfs-add-passphrase and ecryptfs-wrap-passphrase to accept passwords
on stdin, and adjusting ecryptfs-setup-private to use the builtin
'printf' function of the shell to pipe to these commands. The dash and
bash shells are known to contain the 'printf' builtin. It is my
understanding that upstream plans to release a new version incorporating
this fix soon.

I didn't see any distributions who have released with a vulnerable
version of ecryptfs (or ecryptfs-setup-pam-wrapped.sh). Debian and
Ubuntu [4] do have vulnerable versions in their development releases,
and our ecryptfs developer has contacted the Debian maintainer directly.

Thanks,

Jamie

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1307)

## Topic

Updated ecryptfs-utils packages that fix a security issue, various bugs,
and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

eCryptfs is a stacked, cryptographic file system. It is transparent to the
underlying file system and provides per-file granularity.

eCryptfs is released as a Technology Preview for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
5.4. These updated ecryptfs-utils packages have been upgraded to upstream
version 75, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. In addition, these packages provide a graphical program
to help configure and use eCryptfs. To start this program, run the command:

ecryptfs-mount-helper-gui

Important: the syntax of certain eCryptfs mount options has changed. Users
who were previously using the initial Technology Preview release of
ecryptfs-utils are advised to refer to the ecryptfs(7) man page, and to
update any affected mount scripts and /etc/fstab entries for eCryptfs file
systems.

A disclosure flaw was found in the way the "ecryptfs-setup-private" script
passed passphrases to the "ecryptfs-wrap-passphrase" and
"ecryptfs-add-passphrase" commands as command line arguments. A local user
could obtain the passphrases of other users who were running the script
from the process listing. (CVE-2008-5188)

These updated packages provide various enhancements, including a mount
helper and supporting libraries to perform key management and mounting
functions.

Notable enhancements include:

* a new package, ecryptfs-utils-gui, has been added to this update. This

package depends on the pygtk2 and pygtk2-libglade packages and provides the
eCryptfs Mount Helper GUI program. To install the GUI, first install
ecryptfs-utils and then issue the following command:

yum install ecryptfs-utils-gui

(BZ#500997)

* the "ecryptfs-rewrite-file" utility is now more intelligent when dealing

with non-existent files and with filtering special files such as the "."
directory. In addition, the progress output from "ecryptfs-rewrite-file"
has been improved and is now more explicit about the success status of each
target. (BZ#500813)

* descriptions of the "verbose" flag and the "verbosity=[x]" option, where

[x] is either 0 or 1, were missing from a number of eCryptfs manual pages,
and have been added. Refer to the eCryptfs man pages for important
information regarding using the verbose and/or verbosity options.
(BZ#470444)

These updated packages also fix the following bugs:

* mounting a directory using the eCryptfs mount helper with an RSA key that

was too small did not allow the eCryptfs mount helper to encrypt the entire
key. When this situation occurred, the mount helper did not display an
error message alerting the user to the fact that the key size was too
small, possibly leading to corrupted files. The eCryptfs mount helper now
refuses RSA keys which are to small to encrypt the eCryptfs key.
(BZ#499175)

* when standard input was redirected from /dev/null or was unavailable,

attempting to mount a directory with the eCryptfs mount helper caused it to
become unresponsive and eventually crash, or an "invalid value" error
message, depending on if the "--verbosity=[value]" option was provided as
an argument, and, if so, its value. With these updated packages, attempting
to mount a directory using "mount.ecryptfs" under the same conditions
results in either the mount helper attempting to use default values (if
"verbosity=0" is supplied), or an "invalid value" error message (instead of
the mount helper hanging) if standard input is redirected and
"--verbosity=1" is supplied, or that option is omitted entirely.
(BZ#499367)

* attempting to use the eCryptfs mount helper with an OpenSSL key when the

keyring did not contain enough space for the key resulted in an unhelpful
error message. The user is now alerted when this situation occurs.
(BZ#501460)

* the eCryptfs mount helper no longer fails upon receiving an incorrect or

empty answer to "yes/no" questions. (BZ#466210)

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated ecryptfs-utils packages,
which resolve these issues and add these enhancements.

Well the question is whether this should be worded as
ecryptfs-setup-{private,confidential} issue, or more generic issue
affecting various ecryptfs-* command line utilities, that only accept
passwords as command line arguments (i.e. no interactive prompt).  So
even though there's not ecryptfs-setup-* script to fix in older
versions, steps done by ecryptfs-setup-* are likely to be performed by
the user manually, resulting in the same risk of leak as with helper
script.  Or do I miss anything?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

That's exactly right, which reminded me, documentation surrounding
ecryptfs also should be updated. I pinged upstream about it.

I was also notified of an additional commit that is desirable (a bugix
for the patch to ecryptfs-setup-private):
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mhalcrow/ecryptfs-utils.git;a=commit;h=2c422e6d2549f90258cddeebf105b066b598bdbb>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: ecryptfs-utils

ecryptfs-setup-private potentially exposes passwords in the process table.

There are two calls in ecryptfs-setup-private to helper utilities:

 \* ecryptfs-wrap-passphrase

 \* ecryptfs-add-passphrase

that use passwords on the command line.

There is a small yet real possibility that these passwords could be exposed on the process table momentarily.

To fix this problem, we need to:

 a) patch both ecryptfs-wrap-passphrase and ecryptfs-add-passphrase to take passphrases on stdin

 b) modify the callers to use a dash/bash builtin function (such as echo or printf) to send this passphrases to those utilities on standard in

Thanks to Jamie Strandboge for the bug report.

This is the patch to solve this for the ecryptfs-add-passphrase and ecryptfs-wrap-passphrase utilities. The rest of the ecryptfs\*passphrase\* utilities should be solved in a similar manner. These are the most important two, as well as the callers in ecryptfs-setup-private.

This should be released for Intrepid.

Updated debdiff. Thoroughly tested:

\* ecryptfs-add-passphrase:

 - tested with no and bad parameters, still shows usage statement

  - regression tested with command line parameters, and using stdin

  - verified that passphrase makes it into the keyring

   . check with "keyctl show"

   . clear with "keyctl clear @u")

 - tested adding arbitrary trailing new line characters and no newline character

   . verifying fgets() is working as expected

\* ecryptfs-wrap-passphrase:

  - tested with no and bad parameters, still shows usage statement

  - regression tested with command line parameters, and using stdin

  - verify that the passphrase get's encrypted

   . cat encrypted file

  - verify that the passphrase can be decrypted with the encryption passphrase

   . ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase

\* ecryptfs-setup-private

 - tested with good and bad passphrases

 - tested on the command line, and interactively

 - unwrapped the passphrases written by ecryptfs-setup-private

 - mounted/unmounted

 - logged out, mounted/unmounted

 - rebooted, mounted/unmounted
