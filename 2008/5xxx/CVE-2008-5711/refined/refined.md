Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5711

**Vulnerable Application:** FaceBook PhotoUploader 5.0.14.0

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `FileMask` property of the ActiveX control `5C6698D9-7BE4-4122-8EC5-291D84DBD4A0`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. By providing an overly large string to the `FileMask` property, an attacker can overwrite memory and control the execution flow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The provided exploit code demonstrates execution of the Windows Calculator.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploited remotely using a crafted HTML page.
*   **ActiveX Control:** The vulnerability resides in the ActiveX control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Attacker must convince the victim to open a malicious HTML page.**
*   **Target system must have the vulnerable ActiveX control installed.**
*   **The attacker can deliver the exploit through a website or other HTML based methods.**

**Technical Details:**
*   The exploit code uses JavaScript to instantiate the ActiveX object, spray the heap with a payload, and trigger the overflow.
*   The `shellcode` variable contains the Windows executable code.
*   The `address` variable specifies the memory address to overwrite.
*   The `block_size` and `blocks` variables are used to spray the heap with NOPs sleds and the shellcode.
*   The exploit crafts a long string and assigns it to the `FileMask` property, overflowing the buffer and redirecting execution to the injected shellcode.
*   The provided exploit utilizes a Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) technique to execute the shellcode, bypassing security mitigations. Specifically, it uses the address of a `pop esi, pop ebp, retn 14` gadget `0x629c1795` from `lpk.dll`.

This exploit uses heap spraying techniques to increase the likelihood that the shellcode is executed by the overflow.
