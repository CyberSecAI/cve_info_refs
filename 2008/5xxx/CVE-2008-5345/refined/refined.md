{
  "cve": "CVE-2008-5345",
  "description": "The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows code loaded from the local filesystem to access localhost. This may allow code that is maliciously placed on the local filesystem and then subsequently run, to have network access to localhost that would not otherwise be allowed if the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for domains that map a name to the localhost).",
  "affected_versions": [
    "Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 10 and earlier",
    "JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 16 and earlier",
    "SDK and JRE 1.4.2_18 and earlier",
    "SDK and JRE 1.3.1_23 and earlier"
    ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows code loaded from the local filesystem to access localhost, bypassing security restrictions that would normally prevent this access if the code were loaded remotely.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient security restrictions for local code",
     "Unrestricted localhost network access"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute code that could access localhost and steal cookies or hijack sessions, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control over local services.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious code placed on the local filesystem.",
      "Running the malicious code locally"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to place malicious code on the local filesystem of a vulnerable system and then cause that code to be executed."
