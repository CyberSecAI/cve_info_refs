```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The LoadPrgAx ActiveX control does not properly restrict the execution of arbitrary Java programs.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary Java programs from a user's local machine through the LoadPrgAx ActiveX control. This is due to insufficient input validation.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can execute arbitrary Java programs on a user's machine by enticing them to view a specially crafted HTML document. This could lead to complete compromise of the user's system.

Attack vectors:
An attacker can craft a malicious HTML document, which could be delivered through web pages or HTML email, and when a user views such a document, the arbitrary Java program will be executed by the vulnerable ActiveX control.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious HTML document and entice the user to view it. They do not need prior authentication or a privileged network position.
