  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Insecure methods in the ARViewer2 ActiveX control.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The ActiveX control is marked as \"safe for scripting\" and \"safe for initializing from persistent data\", allowing instantiation from malicious websites.",
        "The `Pages.Save()`, `PrintReport()`, and `Canvas.Save()` methods can be exploited to overwrite arbitrary files.",
        "The `Canvas.Save()` method can be used to write known text into output files.",
        "Lack of proper input sanitization or file path validation when saving files."
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary file overwrite and potential arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Visiting a malicious website that exploits the vulnerable ActiveX control.",
         "Malicious website instantiating the vulnerable ActiveX control and calling the vulnerable methods."

        "User must visit a malicious website.",
        "Attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website."
      ],
       "additional_information": "The `Canvas.Save()` method can be exploited to write a specially crafted file into the user's startup folder, leading to code execution on next logon. A proof-of-concept exploit was provided, demonstrating the creation of files on the desktop and in the startup folder."
