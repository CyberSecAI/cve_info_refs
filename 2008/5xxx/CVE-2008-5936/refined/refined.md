- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to directory traversal and file disclosure due to insufficient input sanitization when handling the `sDir` and `sFileName` parameters in `dir.php` and `edit.php`, respectively.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - **Local Directory Traversal**: The `dir.php` script allows arbitrary directory traversal through the `sDir` parameter, enabling an attacker to access files and directories outside the intended web directory.
  - **File Disclosure**: The `edit.php` script allows arbitrary file disclosure through the `sFileName` parameter, enabling an attacker to view the content of sensitive files on the server.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories on the server's file system. This could expose configuration files, source code, databases or other sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable scripts, manipulating the `sDir` and `sFileName` parameters to perform directory traversal or file disclosure attacks, respectively.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
  - No authentication is needed.
