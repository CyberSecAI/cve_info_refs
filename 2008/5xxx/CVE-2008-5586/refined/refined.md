  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-5586",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the `findoffice.php` script of Check Up New Generation version 4.52, where the `search` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"

       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and needs to know the path to the vulnerable script. No authentication is needed to perform the attack."
