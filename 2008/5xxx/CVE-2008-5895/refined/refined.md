Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5895

**Vulnerable Software:** Mediatheka <= 4.2

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a result of a blind SQL injection flaw present in the `connection.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection. This means that while the attacker cannot directly see the output of the SQL query, they can infer information based on the server's response time.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The `user` parameter in the POST request to `connection.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user passwords, through the blind SQL injection.
*   **Partial Confidentiality Impact:**  The attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data, which impacts confidentiality.
*   **Partial Integrity Impact:**  While not explicitly demonstrated in this exploit, the ability to inject SQL could potentially lead to data manipulation.
*   **Partial Availability Impact:** By injecting long running SQL queries with the `benchmark` function, the attacker can degrade the server's performance.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over HTTP.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a malicious POST request to the vulnerable `connection.php` script.
*   **SQL Injection via `user` Parameter:** The attacker injects SQL code into the `user` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the location of the `connection.php` script.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests with specific parameters.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided Perl exploit script demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability. It utilizes a time-based blind SQL injection technique.
*   The script sends a series of POST requests with modified `user` parameters that include SQL injection payloads. The payload uses the `benchmark` function to introduce a time delay if the injected SQL condition is true.
*   By measuring the server's response time, the attacker can determine if the injected SQL conditions are met and subsequently extract data character-by-character.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit focuses on extracting user passwords, which highlights the security risk posed by this vulnerability.
*   The exploit uses a series of characters (48-57 and 97-102, representing numbers 0-9 and lowercase letters a-f) to systematically brute-force the password.
*   The exploit targets the 'password' field in the 'users' table, based on the provided user id.
*   The script leverages the `ascii` and `substring` SQL functions to extract individual characters from the password and compare their ASCII values.
