Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5083:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the JBoss ON (JON) application not properly filtering access to secured properties. If a user knew the name of a secured property, such as 'principal' or 'credentials,' they could retrieve security information about the resources managed by JBoss ON.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The system fails to restrict access to sensitive properties, leading to potential information leakage.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Users could gain access to private properties, potentially including credentials and other sensitive data.
- **Lack of proper filtering:** The application did not filter out results related to password types of properties.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Exposure of credentials:** Attackers could obtain usernames and passwords, potentially compromising managed resources.
- **Compromise of managed resources:** With stolen credentials, attackers could gain unauthorized access and control over JBoss ON managed resources.
- **Information leakage:** Sensitive configuration details could be exposed.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct access:** An attacker with access to JBoss ON could retrieve sensitive properties by knowing their names, exploiting the lack of filtering.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to JBoss ON is required.
- Knowledge of specific secured property names (e.g., 'principal', 'credentials') is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affected JON 2.1.x and was fixed in JON 2.1.2 SP1.
- The fix involved filtering out results dealing with "PASSWORD" type properties.
- This bug was marked as a duplicate of bug 536105, which is related to group definitions being able to display password fields from plugin/resource config.
