Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5882:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `login.asp` page of the Citrix Broadcast Server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize or validate user input provided through the `txtUID` HTTP POST parameter, allowing for malicious SQL queries to be injected into the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the web interface.
- Data extraction: An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database using blind SQL injection techniques.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST parameter manipulation: The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious SQL code into the `txtUID` parameter of an HTTP POST request to the `login.asp` page.
- Remote Attack: The attack can be initiated remotely without requiring local access to the vulnerable system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No authentication required: The SQL injection is present in the login page before authentication, requiring no prior access to the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Citrix Broadcast Server 6.0 and possibly other versions.
- A patch is available from Citrix (Document ID CTX119315).
- The Avaya AG250 Broadcast Server 2.0 is also vulnerable to this flaw.
- The vulnerability has a high risk rating with a CVSS base score of 7.5.
- The vulnerability has a high exploitability subscore of 10/10 because it is easy to exploit remotely.
- There is a partial impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability due to the possibility of data exposure, data manipulation and service disruption due to exploitation.
