  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-5530",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a bypass of malicious webpage detection in multiple antivirus software by prepending the 'MZ' header to an HTML file, changing the file extension (or removing it), and serving the file to the user's browser. This forces IE to render the HTML even though it is not associated with the HTML file extension.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate checks on file content rather than relying on file extensions by AV software.",
        "The ability of IE6 and IE7 to execute HTML content from non-HTML file extensions or files with no extension.",
         "Insufficiently robust anti-malware detection techniques"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of malicious code embedded within a webpage, potentially compromising the user's system. Antivirus software detection is bypassed, allowing malware to be delivered without user awareness.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker hosts a malicious HTML file with the 'MZ' header, modifies the file extension or removes it, then tricks users into visiting the webpage via a link. The file bypasses AV detection, and the browser executes it.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage and make users visit the page. No specific user interaction beyond navigating to a website is required."
