Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability found in the `ndetail.php` script of the Shahrood application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `id` parameter of `ndetail.php`. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.
- Blind SQL injection: The attacker might not see the results of the query directly but can infer information through the application's responses (e.g., timing, error messages, or differences in content).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database by injecting SQL queries and retrieving sensitive data.
- The exploit could lead to the modification or deletion of data within the database, compromising data integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a web request to the `ndetail.php` script, specifically through the `id` parameter: `www.TarGeT.com/ndetail.php?id=[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target web server hosting the Shahrood application.
- Basic knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques is required.
- No special privileges are mentioned as needed, indicating a remote, unauthenticated attack.

**Additional details:**
- The exploit details provided in the content include the vulnerable application and an example of how to perform the blind SQL injection using `SUBSTRING(@@version,1,1)` to confirm the SQL injection.
