Based on the provided exploit-db content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `evb/check_url.php` file of Pligg 9.9.5b.
*   The `$_GET['url']` parameter is not sufficiently sanitized. While there is some filtering that strips tags and converts HTML special characters, it is not enough to prevent SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can use MySQL's `CHAR()` function to inject malicious SQL code through the `$_GET['url']` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload a PHP shell to the server by using the `INTO OUTFILE` SQL clause.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Once the attacker uploads a PHP shell, they can achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to `evb/check_url.php` with a malicious `url` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Pligg instance.
*   **Knowledge of Server Path (Optional):** The exploit can either attempt to determine the server's file path or, if provided, directly use a specified path to upload the shell.
*   **MySQL `INTO OUTFILE` Privilege:** The MySQL user used by the application must have the file write privileges to the destination folder for a successful exploit.
*   **`magic_quotes_gpc` Off:** `magic_quotes_gpc` needs to be off.

**Additional Details from Exploit:**

*   The provided Perl exploit first tries to extract the server path from a configuration file.
*   If the path is not automatically discovered, the exploit performs a bruteforce attack against common server paths.
*   The exploit constructs a SQL injection payload using `CHAR()` to build a PHP shell, and then uses `INTO OUTFILE` to save the shell on the server.
*   After a successful upload, the exploit attempts to connect to the uploaded shell to verify its existence.
