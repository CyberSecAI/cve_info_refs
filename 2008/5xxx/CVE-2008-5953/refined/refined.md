  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2008-5953": {
      "details": "The KTP Computer Customer Database CMS 1.0 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion. The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input passed to the 'p' parameter, which allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.",
      "root_cause": "Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input to the 'p' parameter.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, which can lead to information disclosure. By injecting PHP code into the web server's log files, an attacker can gain remote command execution.",
      "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the 'p' parameter in the URL, an attacker can inject paths to arbitrary files on the server. By crafting requests that inject PHP code into web server logs, the attacker can later execute the code using LFI.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. To achieve remote code execution, they need to be able to inject data into web server logs and then exploit the LFI vulnerability to execute the injected code."
