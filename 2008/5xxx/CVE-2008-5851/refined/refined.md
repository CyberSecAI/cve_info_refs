{
  "CVE-2008-5851": {
    "Description": "The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in MyPBS application.",
    "Root cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of the 'seasonID' parameter in the index.php file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying database content, or even gaining control of the server by using functions like 'load_file' to read arbitrary files on the server.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP GET requests by injecting malicious SQL code into the 'seasonID' parameter of the index.php file. Specifically, a 'UNION ALL SELECT' statement is used to inject the 'load_file' function to read an arbitrary file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application and has to know the location of the vulnerable resource (index.php) and parameter ('seasonID')."
