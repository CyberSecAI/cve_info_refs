Subject: Re: CVE request -- Python < 2.6 PySys_SetArgv issues (epiphany, csound, dia, eog, gedit, xchat, vim, nautilus-python, Gnumeric)

Your subject seems to claim that this vulnerability is fixed on the
Python side in 2.6 -- can you elaborate on that?

James Vega in the bug report you referenced [1] wrote:

However, the specification of absolute imports [2] states:

So absolute imports do not fix situations where you (e.g.) "import re"
with CWD=/tmp in sys.path. Also, the test case shows that at least
Python 2.6.1's PySys_SetArgv behaves the same:
$ ./484305 ""
['']
['', '/usr/lib64/python26.zip', '/usr/lib64/python2.6', '/usr/lib64/python2.6/plat-linux2', '/usr/lib64/python2.6/lib-tk', '/usr/lib64/python2.6/lib-old', '/usr/lib64/python2.6/lib-dynload', '/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages', '/usr/lib64/portage/pym']

I've heard that this isn't fixed in py2.6.   Also when you first pinged me about this, there were two proposals to fix this in python instead of each app. (I assume that's what this BZ is for):  So our proposal is to fix this vulnerability on Python package basis, i.e: 1, either append the arguments provided to the python script on the     command line as the LAST argument of the sys.path -- the same    behavior as Perl does (patch attached), 2, or perform some embedded Python sys.path sanitization based    on Debian patches (see above links) and include it into the     code of PySy_SetArgv function, so all packages using this    function would be no more vulnerable to this flaw.  ...the first one, if applied just to embeded apps., seemed fine from a working POV ... but could still be exploited (although less so). The second seemed like it might break things as it just did:   PyRun_SimpleString("import sys; sys.path = filter(None, sys.path)");  ...also having a quick look at PySys_SetArgv his morning ... why can't we just filter out the cases where ARGV[0] == NULL or whatever it is, so they don't add "" to the path in the first place?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c2)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2009-01-28 15:18:47 UTC  ``` Fixing this in python would definitely be better than fixing it in all the apps.  Most any app that embeds a python interpreter will be hit by this, since the documentation for PySys_SetArgv says to use a bogus argv[0] in that case.  I pushed an update out for gedit already (see [bug 481556](show_bug.cgi?id=481556 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2009-0314 gedit: untrusted python modules search path")) but gedit upstream is hesitant to take the fix because this really seems like a python issue.

It didn't fix all problems.  2. Not sure how it interacts with "common" names, like "import utils" sub-modules which are in more than one module.  ...I don't really care about #1, if it fixes something it's better than nothing. But I don't want to break anything due to #2 unless upstream signs off on it ... not that I know it'll break, but I'd just rather not.   Better, I think, would be to distinguish between gedit running from /tmp which happens to load the interpreter ... and someone doing "./yummain.py" or whatever in a directory with yum in it. Ie. have something trigger between what python passes to SetArgv and what gedit/etc. pass?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c6)  Nikolaus Filus    2009-02-03 19:11:39 UTC  ``` I seem to be a recent victim of this bug as I wondered for several weeks now, why my totem and my rhythmbox players crashed at startup.

After some debuggin it was sure, that python plugins were the culprit as both apps crashed while initializing the embedded interpreter. The reason was actually found now:  I'm a hobby python programmer and downloaded some recipes from ASPN and saved them in my $HOME - one of them was a custom optparse.py! Now most python libs will ask for optparse sooner or later and as $HOME seems to be the CWD for the whole Xorg session all my GUI apps crashed with a SIGSEV when opened from nautilus.  Please try to find a fix ASAP....   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c22)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2009-03-12 02:36:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 334888](attachment.cgi?id=334888&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=334888&action=edit) Don't ever add "" and don't add cwd when python is embedded  Hey Jan, this untested patch might work.  I'd appreciate if you could look at it and try it out.  What it does is check if Py_SetProgramName() has been called and if it *hasn't* been called then assume that PySys_SetArgv is getting called from an embedded interpreter.  I'm not sure this is a perfect litmus test, but I looked at a few of the affected applications and they didn't call SetProgramName().  Also, I tried   print sys.executable   from idle, ipython, and python and it shows that it is getting set for all those cases, so I think the test may be good enough. I also added print sys.executable at the top of some python programs, and it's set in those cases, too.

Quite independently of your patch, I've create something very similar, which attempts skip path modification if realpath failed.  It adds special checks to do modification if python is run in interactive mode or with -c argument.  My proposed change is in upstream bug:  <http://bugs.python.org/issue5753#msg90336>  Comments are welcome.  I've not checked thoroughly it there may be some catch when the fix is combined with HAVE_CANONICALIZE_FILE_NAME patch, which we have and it never went upstream.  > ipython  Btw, ipython seems to put '' in sys.path intentionally and it's done out of PySys_SetArgv.   ```  [Comment 44](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c44)  Petr Šplíchal    2009-07-10 08:57:45 UTC  ``` Tomas, can you describe in which of the following cases modules would be read from the current directory if your patch is used?  orig  patch run as ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ yes   ???   python test.py yes   ???   python ./test.py yes   ???   python /tmp/396/test.py yes   ???   /bin/env python test.py  yes   ???   test.py yes   ???   ./test.py yes   ???   /tmp/396/test.py yes   ???   /usr/bin/python test.py yes   ???   /usr/bin/python ./test.py yes   ???   /usr/bin/python /tmp/396/test.py  no    ???   test-in-different-dir.py no    ???   ./bin/test-in-different-dir.py no    ???   python ./bin/test-in-different-dir.py  I'm asking because with the original patch which changed this behaviour (see [comment #32](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c32)) I've encountered quite a few regressions during the integration testing.  In upstream bug you mention that prepending '' is not desired in the following cases: - ./foo.py - python foo.py - env python foo.py  I'm afraid that especially the second case caused some of the regressions mentioned above.   ```  [Comment 48](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c48)  Tomas Hoger    2009-07-10 09:35:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #44](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c44)) > Tomas, can you describe in which of the following cases modules > would be read from the current directory if your patch is used?  Just to clarify...  I'm *not* trying to prevent loading of module from current directory when using something like 'python test.py', I'm trying to prevent '' being added to sys.path.  It's not the same.  If you run 'python whatever.py', full path to a directory where whatever.py is located is added to sys.path.  This seems intended and desired, and not doing so is what leads to regressions you've probably seen before.  It's also not a big security risk, as if you're running python inside the directory where other users can write their files, the main script you're running may be maliciously modified as well.  Not perfect, as you can easily shoot yourself in a foot (e.g. by saving some script to /tmp and then running it from there), but seems to be expected and relied upon behaviour for python / perl / ... .  So instead of checking only whether modules are loaded from current directory, you should also look at sys.path.  > yes   ???   python test.py > yes   ???   python ./test.py  Yes, as `pwd` will be in sys.path.  > yes   ???   python /tmp/396/test.py  Are you sure about this?  This should not try to load modules from cwd even before patch, should rather use /tmp/396.  > yes   ???   /bin/env python test.py  Yes, `pwd`.  > yes   ???   test.py > yes   ???   ./test.py  `pwd`  > yes   ???   /tmp/396/test.py  Same as above, should not load modules from cwd.  > yes   ???   /usr/bin/python test.py > yes   ???   /usr/bin/python ./test.py > yes   ???   /usr/bin/python /tmp/396/test.py  Same as above for python without full path.  > no    ???   test-in-different-dir.py  Do you have . in $PATH for this test?  Otherwise, it should not even run, right?  If you have . in $PATH, or actually run it with ./, you should have `pwd` in sys.path.  > no    ???   ./bin/test-in-different-dir.py > no    ???   python ./bin/test-in-different-dir.py  `pwd`/bin should be in sys.path.  > In upstream bug you mention that prepending '' is not desired in > the following cases: > - ./foo.py > - python foo.py > - env python foo.py  That's right, and it does not happen in unpatched version, unless I'm missing something...   ```  [Comment 50](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c50)  Petr Šplíchal    2009-07-10 10:11:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #48](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c48)) > > yes   ???   python /tmp/396/test.py >  > Are you sure about this?

The first 10 tests check whether modules are loaded from the script's directory, the last three checked that modules sitting in cwd are not loaded, when script resides elsewhere.  Thanks for clarifying the issue with sys.path. I don't know what exactly was broken with the original patch. Just wanted to make sure we don't run into those regressions again.   ```  [Comment 58](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c58)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-04 22:04:32 UTC  ``` python-2.6.2-8.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/python-2.6.2-8.fc12>   ```  [Comment 59](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c59)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-04 22:05:06 UTC  ``` python-2.6.4-27.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/python-2.6.4-27.fc13>   ```  [Comment 60](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c60)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-04 22:05:31 UTC  ``` python-2.6-14.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/python-2.6-14.fc11>   ```  [Comment 61](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c61)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-04 22:10:48 UTC  ``` python3-3.1.2-6.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/python3-3.1.2-6.fc13>   ```  [Comment 62](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c62)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-04 22:12:03 UTC  ``` python26-2.6.5-5.el5 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 5. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/python26-2.6.5-5.el5>   ```  [Comment 63](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c63)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-14 17:09:41 UTC  ``` python-2.6.4-27.fc13 has been pushed to the Fedora 13 stable repository.

	issues (epiphany, csound, dia, eog, gedit, xchat, vim, nautilus-python,
	Gnumeric)

Hello again Steve,

  got couple of points to discuss yet:

  1, thanks! for all the CVEs (probably more reports still
to come, since currently still investigating all
the F10 srpms code in Everything repo to ensure we didn't
miss something). Recommending other distros to behave in
similar way.

  2,

>

Not aware of any upstream Python bug report
yet (there are still some obstacles with the patch :(,
so it seems the upstream root Python issue fix can not
be expected any time soon (that's why we reported this issue
in most affected applications/packages at least).

Current RH status can be seen here:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c1> and here:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c4> and here:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c5>

For testing purposes it is possible to use Ray Strode's test case
from:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=481556#c8>

The Python upstream bug report will follow as soon as we will
find a patch, which would resolve also the 'sub-modules,
which are in more than a one file' ('import utils' example) case.

3, The original CVE-2008-5983 description will need modification.
Robert is right, this issue is still present also in Python
2.6 (even absolute imports didn't resolve it). For more
details please proceed to:

<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/01/28/5> and to:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c1>

So please update the text of CVE-2008-5983 to state:

"... in Python prepends an empty string to sys.path ...".

Thanks && regards, Jan.

# USN-1596-1: Python 2.6 vulnerabilities

4 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Python 2.6.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [python2.6](/security/cves?package=python2.6) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language

## Details

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.

An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances.

This update adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the

PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime

objects with an unpredictable value. ([CVE-2012-1150](/security/CVE-2012-1150))

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [python2.4](/security/cves?package=python2.4) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 2.4)

## Details

USN-1613-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Python 2.5. This update provides the

corresponding updates for Python 2.4.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 computed hash values

without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If

a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive

CPU resources. ([CVE-2012-0876](/security/CVE-2012-0876))

Tim Boddy discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 did not properly

handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or

application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory

resources. ([CVE-2012-1148](/security/CVE-2012-1148))

crafted environment, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

Do not run gedit from untrusted working directories.

### Resolution

All gedit 2.22.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-editors/gedit-2.22.3-r1"

## Packages

* [python2.5](/security/cves?package=python2.5) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 2.5)

## Details

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

I've heard that this isn't fixed in py2.6.   Also when you first pinged me about this, there were two proposals to fix this in python instead of each app. (I assume that's what this BZ is for):  So our proposal is to fix this vulnerability on Python package basis, i.e: 1, either append the arguments provided to the python script on the     command line as the LAST argument of the sys.path -- the same    behavior as Perl does (patch attached), 2, or perform some embedded Python sys.path sanitization based    on Debian patches (see above links) and include it into the     code of PySy_SetArgv function, so all packages using this    function would be no more vulnerable to this flaw.  ...the first one, if applied just to embeded apps., seemed fine from a working POV ... but could still be exploited (although less so). The second seemed like it might break things as it just did:   PyRun_SimpleString("import sys; sys.path = filter(None, sys.path)");  ...also having a quick look at PySys_SetArgv his morning ... why can't we just filter out the cases where ARGV[0] == NULL or whatever it is, so they don't add "" to the path in the first place?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c2)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2009-01-28 15:18:47 UTC  ``` Fixing this in python would definitely be better than fixing it in all the apps.  Most any app that embeds a python interpreter will be hit by this, since the documentation for PySys_SetArgv says to use a bogus argv[0] in that case.  I pushed an update out for gedit already (see [bug 481556](show_bug.cgi?id=481556 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2009-0314 gedit: untrusted python modules search path")) but gedit upstream is hesitant to take the fix because this really seems like a python issue.  See <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=569214> for the upstream gedit bug.  and <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=569273> for the blocker bug that shows some of the other gnome componenets affected (it's not a short list).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-28 18:53:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 330270](attachment.cgi?id=330270&action=diff "Python CVE-2008-5983 patch -- moving the list of args provided to the python script on the command line as the last argument of sys.path.")

It didn't fix all problems.  2. Not sure how it interacts with "common" names, like "import utils" sub-modules which are in more than one module.  ...I don't really care about #1, if it fixes something it's better than nothing. But I don't want to break anything due to #2 unless upstream signs off on it ... not that I know it'll break, but I'd just rather not.   Better, I think, would be to distinguish between gedit running from /tmp which happens to load the interpreter ... and someone doing "./yummain.py" or whatever in a directory with yum in it. Ie. have something trigger between what python passes to SetArgv and what gedit/etc. pass?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c6)  Nikolaus Filus    2009-02-03 19:11:39 UTC  ``` I seem to be a recent victim of this bug as I wondered for several weeks now, why my totem and my rhythmbox players crashed at startup. I even filed bugs for both projects and tried to get help from the developers. After some debuggin it was sure, that python plugins were the culprit as both apps crashed while initializing the embedded interpreter. The reason was actually found now:  I'm a hobby python programmer and downloaded some recipes from ASPN and saved them in my $HOME - one of them was a custom optparse.py! Now most python libs will ask for optparse sooner or later and as $HOME seems to be the CWD for the whole Xorg session all my GUI apps crashed with a SIGSEV when opened from nautilus.  Please try to find a fix ASAP....   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c22)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2009-03-12 02:36:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 334888](attachment.cgi?id=334888&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=334888&action=edit) Don't ever add "" and don't add cwd when python is embedded  Hey Jan, this untested patch might work.  I'd appreciate if you could look at it and try it out.  What it does is check if Py_SetProgramName() has been called and if it *hasn't* been called then assume that PySys_SetArgv is getting called from an embedded interpreter.  I'm not sure this is a perfect litmus test, but I looked at a few of the affected applications and they didn't call SetProgramName().  Also, I tried   print sys.executable   from idle, ipython, and python and it shows that it is getting set for all those cases, so I think the test may be good enough. I also added print sys.executable at the top of some python programs, and it's set in those cases, too.  I haven't tried compiling the python package to see if the patch actually fixes the problem.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c25)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2009-03-13 01:18:54 UTC  ``` When we get the patch all finalized would be good to see what upstream's reaction to it is.   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c35)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-04-14 12:05:50 UTC  ``` Link to Python tracker:  <http://bugs.python.org/issue5753>   ```  [Comment 43](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c43)  Tomas Hoger    2009-07-10 08:20:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c22)) > Created an attachment (id=334888) [details] > Don't ever add "" and don't add cwd when python is embedded  Upstream does not seem to like the idea of is_embedded.  Quite independently of your patch, I've create something very similar, which attempts skip path modification if realpath failed.  It adds special checks to do modification if python is run in interactive mode or with -c argument.  My proposed change is in upstream bug:  <http://bugs.python.org/issue5753#msg90336>  Comments are welcome.  I've not checked thoroughly it there may be some catch when the fix is combined with HAVE_CANONICALIZE_FILE_NAME patch, which we have and it never went upstream.  > ipython  Btw, ipython seems to put '' in sys.path intentionally and it's done out of PySys_SetArgv.   ```  [Comment 44](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c44)  Petr Šplíchal    2009-07-10 08:57:45 UTC  ``` Tomas, can you describe in which of the following cases modules would be read from the current directory if your patch is used?  orig  patch run as ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ yes   ???   python test.py yes   ???   python ./test.py yes   ???   python /tmp/396/test.py yes   ???   /bin/env python test.py  yes   ???   test.py yes   ???   ./test.py yes   ???   /tmp/396/test.py yes   ???   /usr/bin/python test.py yes   ???   /usr/bin/python ./test.py yes   ???   /usr/bin/python /tmp/396/test.py  no    ???   test-in-different-dir.py no    ???   ./bin/test-in-different-dir.py no    ???   python ./bin/test-in-different-dir.py  I'm asking because with the original patch which changed this behaviour (see [comment #32](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c32)) I've encountered quite a few regressions during the integration testing.  In upstream bug you mention that prepending '' is not desired in the following cases: - ./foo.py - python foo.py - env python foo.py  I'm afraid that especially the second case caused some of the regressions mentioned above.   ```  [Comment 48](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c48)  Tomas Hoger    2009-07-10 09:35:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #44](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c44)) > Tomas, can you describe in which of the following cases modules > would be read from the current directory if your patch is used?  Just to clarify...  I'm *not* trying to prevent loading of module from current directory when using something like 'python test.py', I'm trying to prevent '' being added to sys.path.  It's not the same.  If you run 'python whatever.py', full path to a directory where whatever.py is located is added to sys.path.  This seems intended and desired, and not doing so is what leads to regressions you've probably seen before.  It's also not a big security risk, as if you're running python inside the directory where other users can write their files, the main script you're running may be maliciously modified as well.  Not perfect, as you can easily shoot yourself in a foot (e.g. by saving some script to /tmp and then running it from there), but seems to be expected and relied upon behaviour for python / perl / ... .  So instead of checking only whether modules are loaded from current directory, you should also look at sys.path.  > yes   ???   python test.py > yes   ???   python ./test.py  Yes, as `pwd` will be in sys.path.  > yes   ???   python /tmp/396/test.py  Are you sure about this?

This should not try to load modules > from cwd even before patch, should rather use /tmp/396.  Sorry, I was not accurate with the definition of the "cwd". The first 10 tests check whether modules are loaded from the script's directory, the last three checked that modules sitting in cwd are not loaded, when script resides elsewhere.  Thanks for clarifying the issue with sys.path. I don't know what exactly was broken with the original patch. Just wanted to make sure we don't run into those regressions again.   ```  [Comment 58](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c58)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-04 22:04:32 UTC  ``` python-2.6.2-8.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/python-2.6.2-8.fc12>   ```  [Comment 59](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c59)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-04 22:05:06 UTC  ``` python-2.6.4-27.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/python-2.6.4-27.fc13>   ```  [Comment 60](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c60)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-04 22:05:31 UTC  ``` python-2.6-14.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/python-2.6-14.fc11>   ```  [Comment 61](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c61)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-04 22:10:48 UTC  ``` python3-3.1.2-6.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/python3-3.1.2-6.fc13>   ```  [Comment 62](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c62)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-04 22:12:03 UTC  ``` python26-2.6.5-5.el5 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 5. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/python26-2.6.5-5.el5>   ```  [Comment 63](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c63)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-14 17:09:41 UTC  ``` python-2.6.4-27.fc13 has been pushed to the Fedora 13 stable repository.

Subject: CVE request -- Python < 2.6 PySys_SetArgv issues (epiphany,
	csound, dia, eog, gedit, xchat, vim, nautilus-python, Gnumeric)

Hello Steve,

  initially CVE-2008-4863 has been assigned for the Blender's
untrusted search path issue.

Though this is a Python flaw (insertion of cwd at the
beginning of the Python modules search path), according to our Python
maintainers it can't be fixed on Python's side due the need
of ensuring the work of other numerous packages, when loading
Python modules.

Similar flaw, like the Blender one, has been discovered in
the following packages:

# USN-1616-1: Python 3.1 vulnerabilities

24 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Python 3.1.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [python3.1](/security/cves?package=python3.1) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 3.1)

## Details

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. These issues only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.

An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances.

This update adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the

PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime

objects with an unpredictable value. ([CVE-2012-1150](/security/CVE-2012-1150))

Serhiy Storchaka discovered that the UTF16 decoder in Python did not

properly reset internal variables after error handling. An attacker could

exploit this to cause a denial of service via memory corruption.

([CVE-2012-2135](/security/CVE-2012-2135))

```

argv[0] is used to seed the value that is prepended to sys.path.

You can take a look at what PySys_SetArgv does at
<http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/release25-maint/Python/sysmodule.c?rev=54836&view=markup>

What it boils down to in the simple case is checking for the existence
of a path separator in argv0.  If that doesn't exist, then a PyString is
created from argv0 with size 0 and sys.path is prepended with that --
empty string used for the first element of sys.path.

> My first entry in sys.path is then the directory above the current

This is incorrect.  In Vim's current code, PySys_SetArgv is called with
an argv that is simply an empty string (and a terminating NULL
sentinel).  This causes sys.path's first element to be the empty string,
thus causing any Python import statements to use Vim's current working
directory as the first location to check for the requested module.

The filter specifically removes any elements in sys.path that evaluate
to false (i.e., the empty string).

Using the attached print_sys.path.diff, the following is printed when I
start Vim (the sys.path before and after my suggested filter() command):

['', '/usr/lib/python2.5', '/usr/lib/python2.5/plat-linux2',
'/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-tk', '/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload',
'/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages']
['/usr/lib/python2.5', '/usr/lib/python2.5/plat-linux2',
'/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-tk', '/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload',
'/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages']

You can also test it with the simple pytest.c that I've attached by
specifying different arguments as the first element of the argv passed
to PySys_SetArgv.

$ gcc -o pytest $(python-config --cflags) $(python-config --ldflags) pytest.c
$ ./pytest ''
['', '/usr/lib/python2.5', '/usr/lib/python2.5/plat-linux2',
'/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-tk', '/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload',
'/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages']
['/usr/lib/python2.5', '/usr/lib/python2.5/plat-linux2',
'/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-tk', '/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload',
'/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages']
$ ./pytest '/must>not&exist/bogusbinary'
['/must>not&exist', '/usr/lib/python2.5', '/usr/lib/python2.5/plat-linux2',
'/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-tk', '/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload',
'/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages']
['/must>not&exist', '/usr/lib/python2.5', '/usr/lib/python2.5/plat-linux2',
'/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-tk', '/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload',
'/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages']

This is just extra work for no gain.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
