{
  "CVE-2008-5070": {
    "Root cause": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or deletion, and could compromise the application's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `gud` parameter."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed.",
     "Affected files": [
        "profiles/index.php",
        "profiles/admin.php"
      ],
    "Conditions": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered when `magic_quotes_gpc` is disabled in the PHP configuration."
     ],
    "Details": "The `gud` parameter within the `index.php` and `admin.php` files does not properly sanitize user input, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks. The provided exploit examples demonstrate the retrieval of sensitive data such as user names, passwords, and email addresses from the `prochatrooms_users` table. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable with low attack complexity."
