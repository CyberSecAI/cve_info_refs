- An attacker can delete data on the hard disk drive.
- This can happen if a user visits a malicious webpage while logged into the administrative interface of the vulnerable device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is initiated via a malicious webpage.
- It requires the user to be logged into the web interface of the vulnerable device while visiting the malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious web page that exploits the CSRF vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit the malicious web page while being logged into the administrative interface of the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**
- Firmware updates addressing this vulnerability were available from the vendor since August 28, 2008.
- The vulnerability was reported to IPA by Takayuki Ogiso.
