Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5628:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the 'term' parameter of the `index.php` script in CMS little version 0.0.1. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `term` parameter in `index.php` is directly used in a database query without escaping or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to:
   - Extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords.
   - Potentially modify data within the database or even execute arbitrary commands, depending on the database permissions and configuration.
   - Gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` script. The attacker manipulates the `term` parameter in the URL to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
   - The application must have `magic_quotes_gpc` turned off. The exploit notes that this is a requirement for successful exploitation
   - No authentication or specific privilege is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit script demonstrates the attack using a modified URL:
```
$target."/index.php?term=a%%27%20and%201=2%20union%20select%201,concat(0x3a3a3a,name,0x3a3a,password,0x3a3a3a),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12%20from%20personal_users%20limit%201%20offset%20".$start."--+and+1=1"
```
   - It uses a `union select` statement to extract the `name` and `password` fields from the `personal_users` table.
   - The exploit uses `concat(0x3a3a3a,name,0x3a3a,password,0x3a3a3a)` to format output so it can be split later.
   - The `limit 1 offset $start` clause is used to retrieve user data one entry at a time.
   - The `--+and+1=1` is appended to ensure the rest of the query is valid and that the query does not fail due to the original query.
   - The `a%%27%20and%201=2%20` is there to create a false condition that ensures the union select query is always executed.

The script iterates through the table, incrementing the offset to dump all usernames and passwords.
