Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described for CVE-2008-5200:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a blind SQL injection flaw within the `id` parameter of the `com_xewebtv` component in Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not directly display the results of the SQL query, making it "blind." The attacker must infer the results by observing the application's behavior, such as the presence or absence of a specific string in the response.
*   **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `id` parameter, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Direct SQL Query Manipulation:** The `id` parameter is used directly within the SQL query, without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information. In the provided exploit code, the goal is to extract the MD5 hash of a user password.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  Successful SQL injection can be a stepping stone for other attacks, such as privilege escalation, data manipulation, and complete compromise of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL of an HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious injection strings.
*   **Identification of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to identify the specific vulnerable parameter and the component causing the issue.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided exploit code is written in Perl and uses `LWP::UserAgent` to send HTTP requests and `Getopt::Long` to parse command-line options.
*   The exploit uses a substring function and character comparison to extract data from the database one character at a time.
*   The exploit targets the `jos_users` table, specifically the `password` field.
*   The exploit confirms successful injection by looking for a specific string (`viewcategory&catid=`) in the response.
*   The exploit script provides instructions on how to find vulnerable sites using Google dorks (`inurl:com_xewebtv`).

**Summary of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection flaw that allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the Joomla database, by injecting malicious SQL code into the 'id' parameter of the 'com_xewebtv' component. The lack of input sanitization and direct usage of the parameter within the SQL query makes the system vulnerable to such attacks. This attack is exploitable remotely through HTTP requests and can lead to data breaches.
