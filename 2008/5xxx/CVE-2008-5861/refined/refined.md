Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `source.php` file of the FreeLyrics application.
*   The `p` parameter in `source.php` is used to specify the file to be displayed, and this parameter is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Disclosure:** The application is susceptible to remote file disclosure because it allows an attacker to specify a file path using the `p` parameter.  The application then outputs the contents of this file directly to the browser.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The `source.php` script does not sanitize the user-supplied input via the `p` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can view the contents of arbitrary files on the server.
*   Sensitive information such as configuration files (e.g., `config.php`) could be exposed, which may contain database credentials or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request with the vulnerable `p` parameter to the `source.php` script (e.g., `http://[target]/[path]/source.php?p=config.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   No authentication is required for exploiting the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code (`http://[target]/[path]/source.php?p=config.php`) is more descriptive than the standard CVE description, showing a proof of concept.
*   The exploit was found by "Piker" from D.O.M Labs.
