Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-5047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the Mole Group Rental Script. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered in the login functionality of the script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the login form, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query. This is an authentication bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting a specific SQL payload (' or '1=1), an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and log in as an administrator.
* **Potential for broader database compromise:** With the ability to execute SQL queries, there is a high potential for data theft, data modification, and possibly complete control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Remote, HTTP request:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a web browser by sending a malicious login request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the Mole Group Rental Script.
* No special privileges or specific network positions are required to perform the attack

**Technical Details:**
*   The exploit uses the following credentials to bypass the admin login:
    *   Username: `admin' or '1=1`
    *   Password:  `Cyber-Zone` (or any arbitrary value)
*   The specific vulnerable page is: `http://rent.mole-group.com/admin/login.php?in_login=yes&retpage=%2Fadmin%2Findex.php` (as a live demo)
