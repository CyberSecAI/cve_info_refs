Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the Ars Technica article:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a vulnerability in the JavaScript engine used by popular browsers (IE, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome).
*   A specific JavaScript function, when called, leaves a temporary footprint on the computer. This footprint can be identified by other websites, allowing them to track which sites a user is logged into.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **In-Session Phishing:** The primary vulnerability is the ability for a malicious website to detect if a user is logged into another specific website. This allows for "in-session" phishing attacks.
*   **JavaScript Function Tracking:** The core weakness lies in the JavaScript function that allows for cross-site tracking of user sessions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers can use this to present fake login pop-ups or other lures that trick users into re-entering their credentials.
*   **Account Takeover:** Successful credential theft can lead to account takeover and subsequent malicious activities by the attacker.
*   **Data Theft:** Besides credentials, attackers might try to steal other types of data through deceptive pop-ups (e.g., personal information via a fake survey).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Websites:** The attack relies on injecting malicious JavaScript code into legitimate websites. The higher the traffic of the compromised website, the more potential victims.
*   **Simultaneous Browser Sessions:** The attack requires the victim to have an active, logged-in session with a target website (e.g., banking website) and to be simultaneously browsing a compromised website in another tab or window.
*   **Malware Injection:** The malicious code injects a pop-up window that appears to be from the legitimate logged-in website, prompting for credentials or other information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Website Compromise:** Attackers need the ability to compromise websites and inject malicious JavaScript.
*   **Target Awareness:** Attackers must be aware of which websites the JavaScript vulnerability can track (e.g., financial institutions, social networks).
*   **Malware Development:** They need to create malware that can detect active sessions and generate convincing fake pop-ups.
*  **No direct interaction with the victim's system is required initially:** The attack occurs when the user navigates to a compromised web page after having logged into a target website.

**Additional Details (Not in CVE Description):**

*   The attack is described as not requiring user ignorance, making it more dangerous than typical phishing attempts.
*   Trusteer, the security firm that discovered this vulnerability, also sells web security tools, suggesting that the researchers are also aiming to promote their company's products.
*   The researchers note that many types of websites use the vulnerable JavaScript function, including financial institutions, online retailers, social networking, gaming, and gambling websites.
*   The article suggests simple mitigations such as rapid session disconnects when a user is idle and warnings about logging in through pop-ups.
*   The researchers mention that the malware infection is temporary, although the exact duration is not given.
*   The attack leverages the JavaScript engine itself, highlighting a client-side vulnerability.
