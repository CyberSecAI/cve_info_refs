Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5494:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `com_contactinfo` component of Joomla. Specifically, the `catid` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`catid` parameter) before using it in a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, such as usernames and passwords (as demonstrated in the provided exploit).
- **Integrity Impact:** While not explicitly stated, an attacker could potentially modify data within the database using SQL injection.
- **Availability Impact:**  Although less direct, successful SQL injection could lead to data corruption or even the denial of service by manipulating critical database records.
- The CVSS score is given as 7.5/10, indicating a high risk.
- The exploitability subscore is a 10/10 showing that it is easy to exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can exploit it over the network.
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests, specifically targeting the `catid` parameter within the `com_contactinfo` component URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** An attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of target:** An attacker needs to know that the site is running a vulnerable version of Joomla with the `com_contactinfo` component, and can identify the vulnerable parameter.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit provided uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the `jos_users` table, specifically concatenating usernames and passwords using `concat(username,char(58),password)`. This demonstrates the capability to access sensitive user information.
- The exploit uses the following structure:
`http://localhost/Path/index.php?option=com_contactinfo&catid=-9999/*/UNION/*/SELECT/*/1,2,concat(username,char(58),password),4,5,6,7,8,9,0,11,12,13,14,15,16+from+jos_users/*`

**Additional Information**
- The exploit was first documented on 2008-11-11.
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the `com_contactinfo` component
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command)

In summary, CVE-2008-5494 describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Joomla `com_contactinfo` component, allowing remote attackers to potentially access sensitive information by manipulating the `catid` parameter. The exploit is straightforward, requiring no authentication, and poses a significant risk to vulnerable systems.
