How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2008-62

## Additional XSS attack vectors in feed preview

Announced
December 16, 2008
Reporter
moz\_bug\_r\_a4
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.19

### Description

Mozilla security researcher **moz\_bug\_r\_a4** reported
an additional variation on the feed preview vulnerabilities
[fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.17](mfsa2008-39.html).
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 demonstrated that it was still possible to
use the feed preview as a vector for JavaScript privilege escalation.
An attacker could use this issue to run arbitrary JavaScript with
chrome privileges.

Firefox 3 is not affected by this issue.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. These problems could allow

an attacker to crash the browser and possibly execute arbitrary code with user

privileges. ([CVE-2008-5500](/security/CVE-2008-5500))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that the same-origin check in Firefox could be

bypassed by utilizing XBL-bindings. An attacker could exploit this to read data

from other domains. ([CVE-2008-5503](/security/CVE-2008-5503))

Several problems were discovered in the JavaScript engine. An attacker could

exploit feed preview vulnerabilities to execute scripts from page content with

chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5504](/security/CVE-2008-5504))

Marius Schilder discovered that Firefox did not properly handle redirects to

an outside domain when an XMLHttpRequest was made to a same-origin resource.

It's possible that sensitive information could be revealed in the

XMLHttpRequest response. ([CVE-2008-5506](/security/CVE-2008-5506))

Chris Evans discovered that Firefox did not properly protect a user's data when

accessing a same-domain Javascript URL that is redirected to an unparsable

Javascript off-site resource. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious

website, an attacker may be able to steal a limited amount of private data.

([CVE-2008-5507](/security/CVE-2008-5507))

Chip Salzenberg, Justin Schuh, Tom Cross, and Peter William discovered Firefox

did not properly parse URLs when processing certain control characters.

([CVE-2008-5508](/security/CVE-2008-5508))

Kojima Hajime discovered that Firefox did not properly handle an escaped null

character. An attacker may be able to exploit this flaw to bypass script

sanitization. ([CVE-2008-5510](/security/CVE-2008-5510))

Several flaws were discovered in the Javascript engine. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to execute

arbitrary Javascript code within the context of another website or with chrome

privileges. ([CVE-2008-5511](/security/CVE-2008-5511), [CVE-2008-5512](/security/CVE-2008-5512))

Flaws were discovered in the session-restore feature of Firefox. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to

perform cross-site scripting attacks or execute arbitrary Javascript code with

chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5513](/security/CVE-2008-5513))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [2.0.0.19+nobinonly1-0ubuntu0.7.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/2.0.0.19%2Bnobinonly1-0ubuntu0.7.10.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox to effect the

necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

 ------- [Comment #68](/show_bug.cgi?id=453526#c68 "VERIFIED FIXED - Remaining attack vectors in feed preview on 1.8 branch") From moz\_bug\_r\_a4@yahoo.com 2008-09-03 05:11:44 PDT
There are two oversight. fx2.0.0.17 is still exploitable.
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/components/feeds/src/FeedWriter.js&rev=1.2.2.36&mark=635#623>
This is exploitable. I'll attach a testcase.
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/components/feeds/src/FeedWriter.js&rev=1.2.2.36&mark=404,406#397>
I think this is unsafe. But, I cannot create a testcase since I don't know a
way to execute this catch block.
