{
  "CVE-2008-5079": {
    "Description": "The ATM subsystem did not correctly manage socket counts. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a system hang, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the ATM subsystem's `svc_listen` function not properly handling multiple calls on the same socket. Specifically, it allows duplicate `listen()` calls, which corrupts the vcc table.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Incorrect management of socket counts in the ATM subsystem.",
      "Missing check to prevent duplicate `listen()` calls on the same socket.",
      "Corruption of the vcc table due to multiple listen() calls."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering an infinite loop within the kernel or corrupting the vcc table, leading to system instability.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can exploit the vulnerability by making two calls to `svc_listen` on the same socket, followed by reading the `/proc/net/atm/*vc` file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to execute the vulnerable `svc_listen` function calls and read the `/proc/net/atm/*vc` file."
