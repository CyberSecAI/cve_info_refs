Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-5705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `verlihub` software's failure to sanitize user-supplied input passed to the system shell via the "trigger" mechanism. Specifically, the `cTrigger::DoIt()` function in `src/ctrigger.cpp` appends user-controlled data to a command string which is then executed by `system()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. Because user input is directly incorporated into a shell command without proper sanitization, malicious users can inject arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** The code creates a temporary file named `/tmp/trigger.tmp`. An attacker could potentially pre-create this file as a symlink to another file they want to overwrite or manipulate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** If the `verlihub` daemon is running with root privileges, successful command injection can result in complete control of the machine.
*   **Data Loss/System Compromise:** The symlink vulnerability combined with command execution could lead to data loss or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable by users connected to the `verlihub` hub.
*   **Trigger Mechanism:** Attackers leverage the "trigger" mechanism to inject malicious commands as arguments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be a connected user to the `verlihub` hub.
*   **User with Trigger Permissions:** The attacker must have the ability to use triggers on the hub, with the hub configured to accept arguments.
*   **Knowledge of Trigger Command:** The attacker needs to know the correct trigger command.

**Additional Information from Content:**

*   The exploit is triggered by crafting a malicious trigger command (e.g., `+<trigger> \`cat /etc/passwd\``).
*   A patch is provided in the exploit database entry, which sanitizes the input by removing characters such as `;`, `\"`, `'`, `\\`, etc,  and using `popen` instead of `system`.
*   The bug report also indicates that the package was ultimately removed from Debian.

**CVE-2008-5706:**

It's also important to note that the exploit-db entry also mentions CVE-2008-5706, although this report is for CVE-2008-5705. This could indicate either that the two CVEs are related (covering different aspects of the same vulnerability, or another vulnerability discovered around the same time) or that it is a mistake in the exploit database's entry.
