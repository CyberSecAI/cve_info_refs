Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `member.php` script of Webmaster Marketplace. Specifically, the `u` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the `u` parameter in `member.php`, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database compromise: An attacker can use the SQL injection to bypass authentication and retrieve sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
- Potential for complete system compromise if database access is powerful enough.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request containing malicious SQL code in the `u` parameter of the `member.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- No special access or privileges are needed, just the ability to reach the vulnerable script.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit example provided in the exploit-db content uses `UNION SELECT` to retrieve the `user` and `pass` fields from the `admin` table:
  `http://www.site.com/member.php?u=15+UNION+SELECT+concat(user,0x3e,pass),2+FROM+admin--`
- The `concat(user,0x3e,pass)` part of the exploit combines the username and password fields using a `>` character as a separator.
- The `--` at the end of the injection is used to comment out the rest of the query.
- The attacker can access the admin login page via `http://www.site.com/Admin/login.php`.
