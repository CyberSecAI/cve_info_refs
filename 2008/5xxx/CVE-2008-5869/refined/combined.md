-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
PR08-24: Proxim Tsunami MP.11 2411 vulnerable to SNMP Injection
Vulnerability found: 2 May 2008
Vendor informed: 2 May 2008, 1st August 2008
Vulnerability fixed: no response was received from the vendor. A
workaround has been included in the "Fix" section.
Advisory publicly released: 9th October 2008
Severity: High
Credits: Adrian Pastor of ProCheckUp Ltd (www.procheckup.com)
Description:
Attackers can inject a malicious HTML/JavaScript payload via the
"system.sysName.0" SNMP OID. Such payload is returned on the web
interface when the administrator user views pages such as
'/config/configure-systems.html'. The injected code can perform any
actions within the context of the current session (full administrative
rights).
Although usually the SNMP write community string must be guessed/cracked
for a SNMP injection [1] attack to work, some embedded devices come with
SNMP read/write access enabled by default. Some examples include many
ZyXEL Prestige router models [2] used in residential and SOHO networks,
and also products used in corporate and government environments such as
the Proxim Tsunami MP.11 2411 Wireless Point-to-Multipoint System.
- From Proxim Tsunami MP.11 2411's user manual:
"
SNMP Read/Write Community Password
The password for read and write access to the MP.11/MP.11a using SNMP.
Enter a password in both the Password field and the Confirm field. The
default password is public.
"
Successfully tested on:
Tsunami MP.11 2411 Wireless Point-to-Multipoint System
Wireless Router v- v1.0.0 Bld#24 SN-03AT15620395 v3.0.3
Note: make/model and firmware version were obtained via the
iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.sysDescr.0 SNMP OID.
Proof of concept:
$ snmpset -v1 -c public 192.168.1.100 sysName.0 s
'"><script>alert(1)</script>'
Fix:
Disable SNMP write access. If SNMP write access is absolutely needed,
change the default read/write community string from "public" to a
non-predictable and hard-to-crack value.
