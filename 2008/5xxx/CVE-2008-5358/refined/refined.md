  "CVE-2008-5358": {
    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Sun JDK and JRE allow for several attacks, including the remote execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2008-5356, CVE-2008-5357, CVE-2008-5358 and CVE-2008-5359 to these issues.",
    "Root cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) when processing image files and fonts. Specifically, a flaw is present in how the JRE handles TrueType fonts, leading to a potential heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Improper Input Validation",
       "Heap Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to gain elevated privileges. For example, an untrusted applet or Java Web Start application could grant itself permissions to read and write local files, or execute local applications accessible to the user running the applet or application. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected system.",
    "Attack vectors": [
       "An attacker could create a specially crafted applet, JAR archive, or Java Web Start application and entice a user to open it." ,
       "A malicious website could host a malicious applet or Java Web Start application that exploits the vulnerability when visited by a user."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can be remote and does not need to have any prior access to the system. The attacker has to entice the user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious file."
