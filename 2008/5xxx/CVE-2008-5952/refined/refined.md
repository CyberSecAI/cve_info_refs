Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5952:

**Summary:**

The provided content indicates that CVE-2008-5952 is associated with a **Blind SQL Injection** vulnerability found in the **KTP Computer Customer Database CMS version 1.0**.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input in the `tid` parameter within the application's URL. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or properly escape user input when constructing SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database queries. Because this is a Blind SQL injection, the attacker cannot see error messages or data in the response, but instead must deduce information based on whether queries evaluate to true or false.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database, modify data, or even gain complete control over the database server. The specific impact depends on the privileges of the database user used by the vulnerable application, but information disclosure is shown in the provided exploit.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL by manipulating the `tid` parameter, injecting SQL code within a single quote and using SQL operators and comments. For example, the exploit shows testing for the database version by injecting `tid=1' and substring(@@version,1,1)=5--`.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They do not need to be authenticated in order to exploit the vulnerability, as the provided exploit shows that the attacker can register or log in as a user and then leverage the vulnerability. Also, magic quotes in php must be disabled for successful exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

* The exploit code provided utilizes boolean logic to determine the query result by observing how different responses are returned by the application for true and false conditions.
* The exploit targets MySQL version 5, although it's possible other SQL versions may also be vulnerable.
* The provided exploit shows that the technician information is exposed if the query evaluates to true, while `n/a` is returned when the query evaluates to false.
* The exploit-db entry also references CVE-2008-5954, which is likely related to the same vulnerability or a similar vulnerability in the same application.
*  The secunia content is mostly unrelated, as it only describes the Secunia Research service by Flexera. The vupen content is also unrelated, as the website is "under construction".

**In summary, the provided content gives details of a Blind SQL injection vulnerability that exists in KTP Computer Customer Database CMS version 1.0. The exploit code provides a method for testing for the vulnerability.**
