Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described for WinCom LPD Total, specifically referencing the information from aluigi.org:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A] Buffer Overflow in Control Filename:**
    *   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow occurs when building an error string related to the inability to create a file specified by a client. The filename provided by the client is used without proper bounds checking when constructing an error string.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation and bounds checking on the client-provided filename during error string construction.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted print job with an excessively long filename.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send print jobs to the WinCom LPD service, could be a local user or remote if the LPD service is exposed to a network.

*   **B] Remote Administration Bypassing:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The authentication mechanism for the administration service on port 13500 is essentially non-existent.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper authentication.
    *  **Impact:** Unauthorized access to manage the WinCom LPD server. An attacker could perform administrative tasks such as adding/removing printers, changing configurations, etc.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Directly interacting with the administration service, either by crafting a new client or modifying the existing admin client program (LPDAdmin.exe).
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to connect to port 13500.

*  **C] Integer memcpy Crash in Remote Administration**
    *   **Root Cause:** The remote administration protocol utilizes signed 8-bit and 16-bit integers to specify the length of strings and the size of data blocks, respectively. An attacker can send negative values for these length/size parameters.
    *   **Weakness:** Using signed integers for length parameters without proper validation.
    *   **Impact:** Remote denial of service by crashing the wincomlpd service.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted packets to the remote administration service (port 13500) with negative values for string length or data block size.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to connect to the remote administration port (13500).

*   **D] Buffer Overflow in Remote Administration:**
    *   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow exists within the function that copies data received over the administration protocol using the size values described in vulnerability C.
    *   **Weakness:** Copying data into a stack buffer using size values controlled by the attacker which can be abused to overwrite the buffer.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted packets with specific size parameters that cause the copy operation to overflow the buffer in the administration service.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to connect to the remote administration port (13500).

**Additional Points:**

*   The provided text notes that vulnerabilities C and D are particularly dangerous when combined with the authentication bypass vulnerability (B).
*   The aluigi.org content provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) for these vulnerabilities.
*   No fix is mentioned in the provided content.

**CVE Correlation:**

The identified vulnerabilities, especially those related to remote administration bypassing and buffer overflows, align with the type of vulnerabilities commonly associated with CVE entries. However, without the official CVE description for CVE-2008-5159, a direct correlation can not be confirmed beyond the fact that the aluigi.org write-up matches the CVE format for bug/vulnerability disclosures.
