Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The `index.php` file in OTManager CMS uses user-supplied input from the `conteudo` parameter without proper sanitization or validation. This allows for both Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application uses the `$_REQUEST['conteudo']` parameter to include files via the `require()` function, which is vulnerable to path traversal. By manipulating the `conteudo` parameter, an attacker can include local files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application directly outputs the user-supplied `conteudo` parameter within the HTML context, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **LFI:**
    *   An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, potentially gaining access to configuration files, database credentials, or other confidential data. In the provided examples, they can read `/boot.ini` in Windows or `/etc/passwd` in Linux (using a null byte injection `%00`).
    *   This can lead to further compromise of the server and/or the website.
*   **XSS:**
    *   An attacker can inject malicious scripts that can steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other client-side attacks within the user's browser.
    *   This can lead to user account compromise and defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **LFI:** The attacker manipulates the `conteudo` parameter in the URL to include local files using path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../`). A null byte injection (`%00`) is used to bypass file extension checking.
*   **XSS:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `conteudo` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable OTManager CMS instance.
*   No specific authentication or user privileges are required to exploit these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are present before any user authentication is involved.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet from `index.php`:
    ```php
    76:  if($_REQUEST['conteudo']==""){
    77:  require("Principal.php");
    78:  }else{
    79:  if(!file_exists($_REQUEST['conteudo'].".php")){
    80:  echo '<center><font size="3"><b>404 URL Invalida</b></font><br><br>Por Favor, Selecione o Conteudo no Menu ao Lado.</center>';
    81:  }else{
    82:       require($_REQUEST['conteudo'].".php");
    83:       }
    84:  }
    ```
*   LFI Example: `http://[Target]/[otmanager_path]/index.php?conteudo=../../../../../../../../boot.ini%00`
*   XSS Example: `http://[Target]/[otmanager_path]/index.php?conteudo=</title><script>alert('XSS test');</script>`

The content provides more details than a typical CVE description by providing the specific vulnerable code lines and example exploits. The mentioned CVE-2008-5201 and CVE-2008-5202 are assigned to the same OTManager vulnerability, this indicates that CVE-2008-5201 is also related to this vulnerability.
