Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5635:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a **SQL injection** flaw in the Active Membership v2 software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting SQL code into the username and password fields, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the login form of the application, specifically the username and password input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft the malicious injection code.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability occurs during the login process, so the attacker doesn't need prior access or credentials to launch the attack.
*   **Exploit string:** `username: r0' or ' 1=1--` and `password: r0' or ' 1=1--`
