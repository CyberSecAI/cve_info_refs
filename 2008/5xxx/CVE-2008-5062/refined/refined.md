Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the lack of proper input sanitization in the `Mini Web Calendar 1.2` application, specifically in the `cal_pdf.php` and `cal_default.php` scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **File Disclosure:** The `cal_pdf.php` script is vulnerable to local file inclusion. By manipulating the `thefile` parameter, an attacker can access arbitrary files on the server's file system.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `cal_default.php` script is vulnerable to XSS. The script does not sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive system files, potentially exposing usernames, passwords, or other confidential information.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could be used to steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, deface the web page, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Disclosure:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `cal_pdf.php` script, including the `thefile` parameter to specify the local path of the file they wish to disclose.
*   **XSS:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `cal_default.php` script, including a malicious JavaScript payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or access to the server beyond being able to send web requests.
*   The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Mini Web Calendar version 1.2.
*   The exploit examples provided in the source confirm the vulnerabilities
    *   Local File Disclosure:  `http://www.site.com/mwcal/php/cal_pdf.php?thefile=/etc/passwd`
    *   XSS: `http://www.site.com/mwcal/php/cal_default.php/>'><ScRiPt>alert(0)</ScRiPt>`
