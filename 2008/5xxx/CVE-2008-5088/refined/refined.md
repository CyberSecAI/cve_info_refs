Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5088:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `email.php` and `question.php` files of PHPKB 1.5 Professional. Specifically, the `ID` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`ID` parameter) before using it in a SQL query, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code. This is a classic example of CWE-89.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leaking sensitive information such as user credentials, application data, etc.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Database takeover:** Attackers could gain full control over the database, depending on database permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack is performed via specially crafted HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `ID` parameter in the `email.php` and `question.php` scripts.
    - Example: `http://site.com/email.php?ID=SQL`
    - Example: `http://site.com/question.php?ID=1 UNION SELECT concat_ws(0x3a,version(),database(),user())/*`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **No authentication:** The exploit does not require any authentication.
- **Basic knowledge of SQL:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft appropriate injection strings.
