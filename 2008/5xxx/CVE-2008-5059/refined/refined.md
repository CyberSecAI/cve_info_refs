Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5059:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists in ModernBill version 4.4.x.
*   It stems from two distinct issues: a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability and a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application allows the inclusion of remote files via the `DIR` parameter in several PHP scripts. Specifically, the scripts `export_batch.inc.php`, `run_auto_suspend.cron.php`, `send_email_cache.php`, `2checkout_return.inc.php`, and `nettools.popup.php` are vulnerable.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS via the `new_language` parameter within the login functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **RFI:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable system. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*  **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in a victim's browser. This can be used to steal session cookies, redirect the user to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **RFI:** By crafting malicious URLs containing the `DIR` parameter pointing to a malicious remote file.
*   **XSS:** By crafting a malicious URL that injects JavaScript code into the `new_language` parameter within the login form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests, which can be done remotely, and inject the malicious payload through the vulnerable parameters.
*  No authentication or elevated privileges are required for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided exploit-db entry provides specific vulnerable URLs for both the RFI and XSS vulnerabilities.
*  The securityreason.com content confirms the existence of both RFI and XSS vulnerabilities in ModernBill 4.4.x

**Summary of vulnerabilities:**

*   **CVE-2008-5059** refers to both Remote File Inclusion and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in ModernBill 4.4.x.
