[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=504352;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: eog
Version: 2.22.3-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security patch
Justification: user security hole
Usertags: pythonpath

eog's python interface calls PySys_SetArgv with an argv[0] that doesn't
resolve to a filename.  This causes Python to prepend sys.path with an
empty string which, due to the use of relative imports, allows the
possibility to run arbitrary code on the user's system if a file in
their working directory matches the name of a python module eog tries to
import.

This should be fixed by Python 2.6 as it uses absolute imports by
default, but I have not been able to test it and this still needs a fix
for packages built against/used with the currently supported versions of
Python.

```
As I discovered while discussing the Python path patch with Vim's
upstream[0], the patch I suggested to fix these bugs only works if the
libc follows SUS' definition[1] of how realpath(3) works.

Specifically, it must return NULL when given an empty string for the
path.  At least FreeBSD instead returns the current working directory of
the process[2], which means that removing the empty elements from
sys.path no longer has an effect.

When sending bug reports to your respective upstream, I'd suggest either
adjusting the patch to simply remove the first element of sys.path or
give a garbage path to PySys_SetArgv and explicitly filter that out of
sys.path (as was done by Vim's upstream[3]).

# Eye of GNOME: Untrusted search path — GLSA **200904-06**

An untrusted search path vulnerability in the Eye of GNOME might result in
the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/eog** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.22.3-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.22.3-r3** |

### Background

The Eye of GNOME is the official image viewer for the GNOME Desktop
environment.

### Description

James Vega reported an untrusted search path vulnerability in the
GObject Python interpreter wrapper in the Eye of GNOME, a vulnerabiliy
related to CVE-2008-5983.

### Impact

A local attacker could entice a user to run the Eye of GNOME from a
directory containing a specially crafted python module, resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application.

### Workaround

Do not run "eog" from untrusted working directories.

### Resolution

All Eye of GNOME users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/eog-2.22.3-r3"
```

Subject: CVE request -- Python < 2.6 PySys_SetArgv issues (epiphany,
	csound, dia, eog, gedit, xchat, vim, nautilus-python, Gnumeric)

Hello Steve,

  initially CVE-2008-4863 has been assigned for the Blender's
untrusted search path issue.

Though this is a Python flaw (insertion of cwd at the
beginning of the Python modules search path), according to our Python
maintainers it can't be fixed on Python's side due the need
of ensuring the work of other numerous packages, when loading
Python modules.

Similar flaw, like the Blender one, has been discovered in
the following packages:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=481553#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-26 10:40:31 UTC  ``` Untrusted search path vulnerability in eog's Python module allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse Python file in the current working directory, related to an erroneous setting of sys.path by the PySys_SetArgv function.  References: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504352#4>  Test case and more details about this issue (reason's why it can't be  fixed in Python) are at: <http://www.nabble.com/Bug-484305%3A-bicyclerepair%3A-bike.vim-imports-untrusted-python-files-from-cwd-td18848099.html>  Debian patch: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=5;filename=02_sanitize_sys.path.patch;att=1;bug=504352>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=481553#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-26 10:43:06 UTC  ``` This issue does NOT affect the versions of the eog package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.  This issue affects the versions of the eog package, as shipped  with Fedora releases of 9, 10 and devel.  Please fix.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=481553#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-26 18:29:04 UTC  ``` Affected file:  src/eog-python-module.c:        PySys_SetArgv (1, argv);   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=481553#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-27 16:14:30 UTC  ``` This should not be an issue for Fedora packages either, as they do not seem to be built with python support.  According to the build logs, affected file is not compiled at all.  $ curl -s <http://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/packages/eog/2.24.3.1/1.fc10/data/logs/i386/build.log> | grep --color 'Python support'  checking whether Python support is requested...  	Python support .............:  no  Similar for latest F11 build.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=481553#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-28 10:31:07 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2008-5987](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-5987) to this vulnerability:  Untrusted search path vulnerability in the Python interface in eog 2.22.3, and possibly other versions, allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse Python file in the current working directory, related to a vulnerability in the PySys_SetArgv function ([CVE-2008-5983](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-5983)).
