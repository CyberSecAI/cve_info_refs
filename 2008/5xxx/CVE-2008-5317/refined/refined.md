Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5317:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer sign error within the `cmsAllocGamma` function in `src/cmsgamma.c`. This function allocates memory for gamma data based on the `nEntries` argument.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Sign Error:** The `nEntries` argument, which determines the size of the memory allocation, is read from an image file and is not properly validated. The `cmsAllocGamma` function treats `nEntries` as a *signed* integer.
*   **Insufficient Memory Allocation:**  A negative value for `nEntries` due to the missing validation can result in an undersized buffer allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption**: An undersized buffer allocation could lead to a buffer overflow when subsequent image data is written into the allocated memory, which can cause memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The vulnerability could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution, if a carefully crafted image is opened.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Image:** An attacker would need to create a malicious image file. This file would need to contain a specially crafted value for the `nEntries` field in the image's gamma data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Image:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious image to the vulnerable system. This could be achieved through various means like,  email,  a website, or any other method where the vulnerable application would process the crafted image.
