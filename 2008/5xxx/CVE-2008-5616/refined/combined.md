How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Advisory: MPlayer TwinVQ Processing Stack Buffer Overflow
Vulnerability
Advisory ID: TKADV2008-014
Revision: 1.1
Release Date: 2008/12/14
Last Modified: 2008/12/20
Date Reported: 2008/12/07
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: MPlayer 1.0rc2 < r28150 and
MPlayer SVN trunk < r28149
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Vendor URL: http://www.mplayerhq.hu
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
CVE-ID: CVE-2008-5616
Patch development time: 8 days
======================
Vulnerability Details:
======================
MPlayer contains a stack buffer overflow vulnerability while parsing
malformed TwinVQ media files. The vulnerability may be exploited by a
(remote) attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of MPlayer.
==================
Technical Details:
==================
Source code file: libmpdemux\demux\_vqf.c
[...]
24 static demuxer\_t\* demux\_open\_vqf(demuxer\_t\* demuxer) {
...
49 char chunk\_id[4];
50 unsigned chunk\_size;
51 [1] hi->size=chunk\_size=stream\_read\_dword(s); /\* include itself \*/
52 stream\_read(s,chunk\_id,4);
53 if(\*((uint32\_t \*)&chunk\_id[0])==mmioFOURCC('C','O','M','M'))
54 {
55 [2] char buf[chunk\_size-8];
56 unsigned i,subchunk\_size;
57 [3] if(stream\_read(s,buf,chunk\_size-8)!=chunk\_size-8) return NULL;
...
86 i+=subchunk\_size+4;
87 while(iDsiz=be2me\_32(\*((uint32\_t \*)&buf[i]));
96 continue; /\* describes the same info as size of DATA chunk \*/
97 }
98 [6] memcpy(sdata,&buf[i],slen); sdata[slen]=0; i+=slen;
[...]
[1] The unsigned int variable "chunk\_size" is filled with a user controlled
value from the media file.
[2] The value of "chunk\_size" is used to calculate the length of the stack
buffer "buf".
[3] "buf" is filled with user controlled data from the media file.
[4] The value of "chunk\_size" is again used as a length specifier for
another stack buffer called "sdata".
[5] The unsigned int variable "slen" is filled with a user controlled value
from the media file.
[6] This memcpy() function copies "slen" bytes of user controlled data from
"buf" into the stack buffer "sdata". As "slen", the source data as well
as the size of the destination buffer "sdata" are user controlled this
leads to an exploitable stack buffer overflow vulnerability.
=========
Solution:
=========
Upgrade to MPlayer 1.0rc2 >= r28150 (see [1]) or MPlayer SVN trunk
>= r28149 (see [2]).
========
History:
========

Package        : mplayer
Vulnerability  : several vulnerabilities
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Ids        : CVE-2009-0385 CVE-2008-4866 CVE-2008-5616
Debian Bug     : 508803

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in mplayer, a movie player
for Unix-like systems. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-0385

It was discovered that watching a malformed 4X movie file could lead to
the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-4866

It was discovered that multiple buffer overflows could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-5616

It was discovered that watching a malformed TwinVQ file could lead to
the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0~rc1-12etch7.

For the stable distribution (lenny), mplayer links against
ffmpeg-debian.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), mplayer links against ffmpeg-debian.

We recommend that you upgrade your mplayer packages.
