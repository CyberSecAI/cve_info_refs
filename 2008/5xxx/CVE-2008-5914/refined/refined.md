Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability:** In-session Phishing

**Root Cause:** A vulnerability in the JavaScript engine used by popular browsers (IE, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome) allows a website to detect if a user is logged into another website. This is achieved through a JavaScript function that leaves a temporary footprint on the computer, which other websites can identify.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **JavaScript Engine Vulnerability:** The core issue is a flaw in how JavaScript functions operate, enabling cross-site tracking of user login status.
*   **Lack of Isolation:** Browsers do not properly isolate the state of different websites the user is logged into.
*   **Pop-Up Reliance:** The attack leverages user's familiarity with legitimate pop-ups from websites, such as bank prompts or survey requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers can trick users into re-entering their login credentials on a fake pop-up, leading to account compromise.
*   **Data Collection:** The method can also be used to lure users into submitting personal data through fake surveys or games.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Compromised Website:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript into a high-traffic website.
2.  **User Visit:** The victim visits the compromised website while simultaneously being logged into a secure website in another browser tab/window.
3.  **Malware Activation:** The malicious JavaScript code activates, detecting the user's active session on the target site.
4.  **Fake Pop-Up:** A fake pop-up is displayed, mimicking the secure website (e.g., bank), requesting login information.
5.  **Credential Capture:** If the user enters their credentials in the fake pop-up, the attackers steal them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Compromise Website:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into a website.
*   **JavaScript Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with JavaScript and the specific vulnerability in the browser's Javascript engine.
*   **Targeted Websites:** The attacker needs to have a predefined list of target websites.
* **User Action:** The user needs to be logged in to a targeted site and have a browser window/tab open while also visiting the attacker-controlled site.

**Additional Details:**
* The attack relies on the user having simultaneous browser windows open.
* The window of opportunity is limited as the malware infection is temporary, however the duration of this window was not specifically mentioned.
* The researchers recommend that users and companies deploy appropriate web security tools and immediately log out of any secure sites once you've finished your tasks.
* The vulnerability is present in major browsers.
