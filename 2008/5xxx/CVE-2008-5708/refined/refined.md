Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `redirect.php` file of SlimCMS version 1.0.0. This script allows for the creation of a new administrator account with a user-defined username and password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** The primary vulnerability is a privilege escalation flaw that allows an unauthenticated attacker to create a new administrator account. This bypasses any existing authentication mechanisms.
- **Lack of input sanitization/validation**: The `redirect.php` script does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided data when creating an administrator account.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Full System Compromise:** A successful attack allows an attacker to create a new administrator account, granting them full control over the SlimCMS installation.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker with admin access can manipulate, delete or steal data stored within the CMS.
- **Website Defacement:** Admin access allows the attacker to deface the website.
- **Malware injection:** Admin access allows the injection of malicious code and scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `redirect.php` file.
- **Form Data:** Specific form data is sent in the POST request which include `newusername`, `newpassword`, and `newisadmin`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable SlimCMS instance.
- **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need prior authentication or any credentials to exploit the vulnerability. They can simply send the malicious POST request.

**Additional Notes:**

- The exploit code provided demonstrates how to create an administrator account with an arbitrary username and password by sending an HTTP POST request to `/redirect.php` including `newusername`, `newpassword` and `newisadmin=1`.
- The exploit code also performs a check to see if the response contains `change.php` which confirms if the admin account creation was successful.
