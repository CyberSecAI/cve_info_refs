Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion flaw in the `slogin_lib.inc.php` file of the "Simple Text-File Login script 1.0.6".

*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** The login script stores usernames and passwords in a plain text file, `slog_users.txt`, which is accessible via a direct request.

**Root Cause:**

*   **Uninitialized Variable:** The `$slogin_path` variable is not properly initialized or sanitized. The code relies on it, and if it's not set, it defaults to an empty string, leading to the RFI vulnerability because the code uses this uninitialized variable in include statements
*   **Insecure Storage:** The use of a plain text file (`slog_users.txt`) to store usernames and passwords exposes this sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** Unsanitized input used in the `include_once` statements.
*   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** Passwords and usernames are stored in plaintext in a publicly accessible file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** An attacker can include a remote file containing malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to usernames and passwords stored in the `slog_users.txt` file, potentially allowing them to compromise user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion:** By manipulating the `slogin_path` parameter in the URL of `slogin_lib.inc.php`, an attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:**  An attacker can directly request the `slog_users.txt` file via the web server to expose stored credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit either the RFI or the data disclosure vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable URL:** Attacker needs to know or find the URL of the vulnerable script `slogin_lib.inc.php` and the path of the user file `slog_users.txt`

**Technical Details:**

* The vulnerable file is `slogin_lib.inc.php`
* The vulnerable include is `include_once ($slogin_path . "header.inc.php");`
* The vulnerable parameter is `slogin_path`
* The user file is `slog_users.txt`

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in version 1.0.6 of the "Simple Text-File Login script"
* The identified fixes are to properly initialize the $slogin_path variable, and to use secure storage practices to store user credentials,
* The exploitability of the RFI is rated as high (10/10), and the overall risk is medium
* The vulnerable script was available from a third-party website, `hotscripts.com` (the link is now broken).
