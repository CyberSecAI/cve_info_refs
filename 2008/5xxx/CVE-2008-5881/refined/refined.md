Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5881:

**Verification:**
The exploit-db.com content explicitly mentions CVE-2008-5881 along with CVE-2009-0103 and describes vulnerabilities in PlaySms 0.9.3. This confirms that the content is related to CVE-2008-5881.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of unsanitized user-controlled variables in `include` statements within multiple PHP files of PlaySMS. Specifically, the `$apps_path`, `$gateway_module`, and `$themes_module` variables are being used without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  The application includes files based on user-supplied input via the `$gateway_module` and `$themes_module` variables. This can be abused to read arbitrary local files on the server.
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application uses user-supplied values from  `$apps_path` variable  in `include` statements. This can be abused to include malicious files from remote locations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By including a malicious remote file using RFI, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining complete control.
- **Sensitive information disclosure:**  LFI allows an attacker to read sensitive information from files on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET requests:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by manipulating parameters in HTTP GET requests to specific PHP files. For example:
  - `http://127.0.0.1/path/plugin/gateway/gnokii/init.php?apps_path[plug]=[Rfi]`
  - `http://127.0.0.1/path/plugin/gateway/gnokii/init.php?gateway_module=[Lfi]`
  - `http://127.0.0.1/path/plugin/themes/default/init.php?apps_path[themes]=[Rfi]`
  - `http://127.0.0.1/path/plugin/themes/default/init.php?themes_module=[Lfi]`
  - `http://127.0.0.1/path/lib/function.php?apps_path[libs]=[Rfi]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable files and parameters (`apps_path`, `gateway_module`, `themes_module`).

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit-db entry provides specific vulnerable file locations: `/plugin/gateway/gnokii/init.php`, `/plugin/themes/default/init.php`, and `/lib/function.php`.
- It also provides specific line numbers in the vulnerable files where the `include` statements exist.
- The Exploit Database entry includes exploit examples illustrating how to exploit both RFI and LFI vulnerabilities.

**Summary:**
The content from exploit-db.com clearly details the RFI and LFI vulnerabilities present in PlaySMS 0.9.3 due to insecure handling of user-supplied input in `include` statements. This enables attackers to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive files on the server.
