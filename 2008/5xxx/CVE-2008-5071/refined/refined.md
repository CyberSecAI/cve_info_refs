Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5071

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a PHP code injection vulnerability within the `itpm_estimate.php` script of Yoxel version 1.23beta.
*   The `estimate_inc.php` file, included by `itpm_estimate.php`, uses `eval()` with unsanitized user-supplied input from the `proj_id` GET parameter.
*   Specifically, the code constructs a new object using user input: `eval("\$pps= new $cname(".$_GET['proj_id'].");");`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code within the `eval()` function by manipulating the `proj_id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **PHP Code Injection:** The primary weakness is the use of `eval()` with user-controlled data, allowing for the execution of arbitrary PHP code.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize or validate the `proj_id` GET parameter before using it in the `eval()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server. This includes reading sensitive files, writing files, executing system commands, and other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specifically crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `itpm_estimate.php` script. The `proj_id` parameter is manipulated to inject PHP code.
*   The specific vulnerable lines are in `includes/project/estimate_inc.php` (lines 85-99).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable Yoxel application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know the path and parameters of the vulnerable script (`itpm_estimate.php`) as well as the injection point (`proj_id` GET parameter)
*   **Authentication:** The exploit requires the attacker to be logged in to Yoxel.

**Exploit Example:**

The provided exploit example shows two ways to exploit this vulnerability:
`http://site.com/[yoxel_v1.23beta]/itpm/itpm_estimate.php?a=LOCAL_OR_REMOTE_FILE&rid=1&proj_id=);include($_GET[a]);die(2`
`http://site.com/[yoxel_v1.23beta]/itpm/itpm_estimate.php?a=LOCAL_OR_REMOTE_FILE&proj_id=);include($_GET[a]);die(2`
These examples use a combination of the `proj_id` parameter and another parameter `a` (passed to the `include()` statement) to attempt to include a local or remote file and then terminates script execution.  A more illustrative example of arbitrary code injection would be crafting the `proj_id` to execute malicious PHP code such as `proj_id=); phpinfo(); die(2);`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit only works if the user is logged into Yoxel.
*   The content provides more details than the typical CVE description by highlighting the exact code and file vulnerable and illustrating how the user-supplied data is used in the code injection.
