Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-5847:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability in Constructr CMS is related to insecure handling of user input, specifically within the `template.php` file and the `show_page` parameter. This lack of sanitization allows for several types of attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The `edit_file` parameter in `template.php` allows directory traversal, potentially leading to source code disclosure and arbitrary file creation. An attacker can use "..", to access any file within server path.
*   **SQL Injection:** The `show_page` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries. The provided example demonstrates how to extract usernames and password hashes from the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Source Code Disclosure:** Attackers can access and view sensitive source code through directory traversal, potentially revealing further vulnerabilities or sensitive information.
*   **Arbitrary File Creation:** Attackers can create or modify files on the server.
*   **Database Compromise:** Through SQL injection, attackers can extract sensitive data, including user credentials, and potentially modify or delete data.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** The combination of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Both vulnerabilities are exploited through crafted HTTP requests targeting specific parameters: `edit_file` in `template.php` for directory traversal and `show_page` for SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable Constructr CMS instance.
*   **Understanding of HTTP:** Basic understanding of HTTP requests and parameters is necessary to construct the exploit URLs.
*   **Basic SQL knowledge:** To exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of web server file system**: To perform directory traversal.

**Additional Notes:**
* The content references that the password hashes are not really encrypted, increasing the severity of a successful SQL injection attack.
* It mentions that the `magic_quotes_gpc` setting needs to be "Off" and `register_globals` needs to be "On" for the exploit to work, indicating these PHP configuration settings play a role in the vulnerability.
* The exploit was publicly disclosed on December 19, 2008.
