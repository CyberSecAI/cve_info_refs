##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## WordPress MU 1.3.3 (11 posts)

   WordPress MU 1.3.3 has just been released and again is a must-have upgrade for all users. It syncs with WordPress 2.3.3 which is a major security update.

   If you haven't upgraded to 1.3.2 then you need to skip that and go to 1.3.3 right now. Here's a list of the security fixes in 1.3.2:

   1. The options pages were overhauled and security tightened. Alexander Concha released an exploit that allows any user with, "'manage\_options' and 'upload\_files' capabilities" to execute arbitrary PHP code. Here's the [exploit](http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/5066). I hope you've all upgraded.

   2. The signup page authentication was missing where new user registration was turned off. A carefully crafted POST could create empty blogs. (I just want to thank the spammers who attacked my dev server with this, it helped me find the exploit, thanks guys!)

   3. Alexander also discovered that file size on upload wasn't checked all the time.

   Download 1.3.3 at <http://mu.wordpress.org/download/>

   Do the security issues also affect the 1.2 branch?

   I'm waiting until the end of the quarter to upgrade from 1.2.5a since things are just too crazy while class is in session.

   It doesn't solve the cookie problem:

   By the way is the team developping Wordpress Mu the same than the Wordpress Single Blog ? If yes why is there such problem with Wordpress Mu whereas it is non-existant with Wordpress Single Blog ?

   Thanks.

   Hello

   Sorry if this is dumb, but just started to use Mu again and have made the upgrade as recommended.

   On WordPress and formerly on WordPress Mu, you could see which version you are running from control panel footer etc. This seems to have disappeared and I did not get the upgrade warning you get with ordinary WordPress.

   Or have I missed something?

   Thanks

   Posted 16 years ago [#](#post-44852)

   I had to think about that one too. You can view the version.php file located in wp-includes and it will tell you all the version info, including the DB version.

   adamrbrown - yes, most definitely. Any and all WordPress MU versions are vulnverable to the options exploit.

   webmastermemento - I haven't seen that problem myself, but I don't use IE. It's not exactly clear where or why the the error is because it works fine for most people. Anyway, this is a core WP issue as it affects both project. Maybe you should reopen this [ticket](http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5076) as it's the same code.

# WordPress [MU] blog's options overwrite

Author
Alexander Concha <alex at buayacorp dot com>
Affected versions
WordPress <= 2.3.2 and WordPress MU < 1.3.2
## Description

WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform with a
focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability.

WordPress allows any user with `manage_options` capability to update directly
any blog's option through `wp-admin/options.php`, so this feature can be used to perform (or hide) multiple
attacks where WordPress expects safe data coming from the DB.

This bug is very critical in those sites using WordPress MU, because any user has the `manage_options` capability.

## Proof of Concept

An [exploit](wp-blog-option-overwrite.txt) that uses `active_plugins` option was developed to test the severity of this bug.

## Solution

For WordPress MU, upgrade to the latest version (1.3.2).

For WordPress (single version), its developers have postponed the fix for future versions (it won't likely go in 2.5), since **by default only Administrators have the `manage_options` capability**.

## Disclosure Timeline

* 08/16/2007 - Bug found
* 12/15/2007 - Vendor contact
* 01/26/2008 - WordPress MU 1.3.2 released
* 02/05/2008 - Public Disclosure

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
