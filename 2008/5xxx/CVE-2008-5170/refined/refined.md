Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `item.php` script of the "Cheats Complete Website 1.1.1" application. The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `itemID` parameter in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database, including administrator usernames and passwords, as well as user data.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful exploitation could potentially lead to further compromise of the server or application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the `itemid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application to send malicious requests.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** Basic knowledge of SQL is needed to craft the injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit examples provided are:

- **Admin Info Retrieval:**
  ```
  www.site.me/patch/item.php?itemid=-999999999+union+select+concat(login,0x3a,password),1,2,3,4,5+from+admin_login/*
  ```
  This injects a SQL query to select the username and password from the `admin_login` table, concatenating them with a colon.

- **Member Info Retrieval:**
 ```
 www.site.me/patch/item.php?itemid=-999999999+union+select+concat(login,0x3a,password),1,2,3,4,5+from+users/*
 ```
   Similar to the admin query, this retrieves usernames and passwords from the `users` table.

The provided exploit demonstrates a `UNION SELECT` based SQL injection. The attacker uses a negative ID that likely doesn't exist to ensure that the original query results are not shown and they inject a malicious query that returns user credentials.

This exploit allows for reading data from the database. It may be possible to escalate the impact by performing further SQL injection attacks (eg. writing to the filesystem) depending on the specific database permissions.
