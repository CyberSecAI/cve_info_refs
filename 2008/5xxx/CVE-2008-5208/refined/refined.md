Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-5208:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **blind SQL injection vulnerability** in the `sub_votepic.php` file of the Datsogallery component for Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not directly display the results of the SQL query, but an attacker can infer the output based on application behavior (specifically, the "Duplicate entry" error). This allows for data exfiltration character-by-character.
*   **Insecure Input Handling:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `user_rating` parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code within the `User-Agent` HTTP header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:** The attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including user passwords and salts. In the provided exploit, the focus is on extracting the password hash and salt from the `#__users` table.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The attacker can use the extracted database information for further malicious activities, such as gaining unauthorized access to the Joomla application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `sub_votepic.php` file with a specially crafted `User-Agent` header. This header contains the SQL injection payload.
*   **Specifically crafted User-Agent header:** The exploit constructs the User-Agent header to include a blind SQL injection payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Joomla application to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable component.
*   **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific vulnerable component (`com_datsogallery`), and the vulnerable parameter (`user_rating`).
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must understand how blind SQL injection works to construct the malicious SQL queries within the `User-Agent` header.

**Additional Details from the Exploit Code:**

*   The exploit code uses a loop to extract the password hash and salt character by character using the blind SQL injection vulnerability.
*   It uses the `Duplicate entry` error to determine if the character is correct.
*   It also checks the Joomla version by verifying the password length, potentially to confirm vulnerability assumptions before data exfiltration.
*   The exploit includes functionality to target specific usernames (`where username='...'`) and specific picture IDs (`id`), making it more flexible.

In summary, the provided information confirms that CVE-2008-5208 involves a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the `com_datsogallery` component of Joomla, which allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database by manipulating the `User-Agent` header in an HTTP request.
