phion Security Advisory 21/10/2008
Microsoft VISTA TCP/IP stack buffer overflow
Summary
-----------------------------
Microsoft Device IO Control wrapped by the iphlpapi.dll API shipping with Windows Vista 32 bit and 64 bit contains a possibly exploitable, buffer overflow corrupting kernel memory.
Affected Systems
-----------------------------
Using the sample program it was possible to verify this issue on following operating systems and configurations:
\* Microsoft Windows Vista Enterprise 32 bit & 64 bit
\* Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate 32 bit & 64 bit
It is very likely that other versions of Windows Vista are affected by this issue.
This issue did not occur on Windows XP.
Installation of Service Pack 1 and/or security updates had no effect in regards to resolve the random crashes.
To execute either the sample program or the route-add command, the user has to be member of the Network Configuration Operators group or the Administrators group.
Since this buffer overflow overwrites kernel memory, it could be possible that members of the Network Configuration Operator group exploit this and take control over the operating system without any restriction.
Impact
-----------------------------
1. When adding a route entry to the IPv4 routing table using the method CreateIpForwardEntry2 and passing an illegal value greater than 32 [2] for the destination PrefixLength member in the DestinationPrefix structure contained in the MIB\_IPFORWARD\_ROW2 structure [3], kernel space memory is being corrupted resulting in random blue screen crashes. The crash does not always occur instantly after executing the provided sample program; it may take a while until the corrupted memory is accessed, causing the operating system to crash with a blue screen. It seems that larger illegal values [2] trigger the crash earlier, during research in our labs it proved that passing the illegal values 129 and 255 accelerates the occurrence of the crash.
2. In addition we were able to reproduce this issue without the sample program, using the built in "route add" command. It seems the "route-add" uses the same method as our sample program, hence creates the same buffer overflow when calling it with an illegal value for the network mask. The syntax we used in the command line is as follows:
route add 1.2.3.4/240 4.3.2.1
This buffer overflow could be exploited to inject code, hence compromising client security.
Remedy
------------
No remedy available from vendor as of November 10, 2008.
Workaround for netfence entegra 1.0 -1.2
---------------------------------------------------
For netfence entegra, phion recommends to use the following workaround:
Install the hotfix provided by phion AG, which is available to all customers and partners for download on the myphion site [4]. This hotfix will replace the existing vista.dll in the phion installation directory, with the newer version 1.0.0.1.
Reported
------------
This vulnerability was first reported to Microsoft on, 22nd October 2008 15:20 (GMT +2).
Acknowledgements
-----------------------------
This vulnerability has been discovered by Marius Wachtler, Michael Burgbacher, Carson Hounshell, Michael Craggs and Thomas Unterleitner on behalf of phion AG.

Appendix B - Research results
After further research we where able to narrow down the issue
and can provide the reason and location of the buffer overflow.
======== Summary ========
The function netio!PtpCreateTrieNode allocates 32 bytes using
the method ExAllocatePoolWithTag, as a buffer. Next the function
netio!PtpCopyPartialKeys tries to copy memory into the previously
allocated buffer using an offset of 24 bytes and the illegal
value as number of bits to be copied. Since this value can be
bigger than 8 bytes the amount of memory copied is greater than
the buffer, overwriting surrounding kernel memory.
======== Parameters ========
CreateIpForwardEntry2 was called with
DestinationPrefix.Prefix = "1.2.3.4"
DestinationPrefix.PrefixLength = 0xEE

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
