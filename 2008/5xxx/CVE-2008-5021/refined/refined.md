{
  "CVE-2008-5021": {
    "Description": "nsFrameManager in Firefox 3.x before 3.0.4, Firefox 2.x before 2.0.0.18, Thunderbird 2.x before 2.0.0.18, and SeaMonkey 1.x before 1.1.13 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by modifying properties of a file input element while it is still being initialized, then using the blur method to access uninitialized memory.",
    "Root cause": "A race condition occurs in the DOM construction code where a DOM method on a file input element is called before the object is completely initialized.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of uninitialized memory",
       "Race Condition"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (crash) and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote attacker",
      "Malicious website"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious HTML document (e.g., HTML email). The attacker also needs to be able to modify properties of a file input element before it has finished initialization and then call the blur method."
