## Security issue details

We provide the details of some fixed security bugs here.

### Possible XSS in moderate

A topic title was not converted to HTML in forum moderation. A user could steal moderator's & administrator's session by injecting JavaScript in the topic title.

### Potential SQL-injections at admin/users.php page

The values of `$_POST['order_by']` and `$_POST['direction']` were escaped, but not logically checked before using in SQL query at the `Administration` ⇒ `Users` page. One could execute any SQL query via making administrator to send a POST-request (e.g. giving him a link to the specially formed page). CSRF confirm message would be displayed.

### Potential SQL-injections in admin/settings.php via configuration values

The values of configuration options were not checked before using in SQL query at `Administration` ⇒ `Settings` page. One could execute any SQL query via making administrator to send a POST-request (e.g. giving him a link to the specially formed page). CSRF confirm message would be displayed.

* Forum versions vulnerable: PunBB 1.3, PunBB 1.3.1.
* Reported by [Stefan Esser](http://www.suspekt.org/ "http://www.suspekt.org/").
* Vulnerability type: [SQL injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection")
* Fixed in [[965]](https://punbb.informer.com/trac/changeset/965 "Link to changeset [965] on PunBB Trac").

#### Topic: PunBB 1.3.2

**PunBB 1.3.2** has been released. Apart from minor bugs, the following security flaws have been resolved (reported by Stefan Esser):

* an [XSS vulnerability in login.php](http://punbb.informer.com/wiki/punbb13/bugs#possible_xss_in_login);
* a possible [SQL-injection in the the admin settings page](http://punbb.informer.com/wiki/punbb13/bugs#potential_sql-injections_in_adminsettings.php_via_configuration_values) with permission config values;
* a possible [SQL-injection in the the admin users page](http://punbb.informer.com/wiki/punbb13/bugs#potential_sql-injections_at_adminusers.php_page).

As usual, security hotfixes for versions 1.3 and 1.3.1 have been released.

**Downloads:** get the latest PunBB on [Downloads page](http://punbb.informer.com/downloads.php#1.3.2) or via [Subversion repository](http://punbb.informer.com/svn/punbb/tags/punbb-1.3.2/).

I was thinking that SQL Injections was part of the past with PHP5 and the new DB methods.
Are punbb still dealing with SQL Injection manually?

The Administrator Alert on 1.3.2 release does not disappear after I read it, same for the New Alerts flag at the top menu.

Is it supposed to be this way?

#### Re: PunBB 1.3.2

You mean there is some rational behind nagging forum admin about non-critical news? ![roll](https://punbb.informer.com/forums/img/smilies/roll.png)

Ruins the idea of admin alerts since people tend to not pay attention to an alert that is always on.

#### Re: PunBB 1.3.2

Thanks for the update. I have successfully updated to 1.3.2 ![smile](https://punbb.informer.com/forums/img/smilies/smile.png)
I have a few questons !
When I updated I kept my Oxygen.css of 1.3.1 because I made some change... color... banner... etc...
But I found Oxygen.css in changed file list (1.3.1 to 1.3.2), so my question is shall I keep or need to change anything ?
Its working fine for me....

and the other quesion,  pun\_repository always shows error... try later something like that...
Is is normal ?

Thanks a lot ![smile](https://punbb.informer.com/forums/img/smilies/smile.png)

Look at [1.3.1 to 1.3.2 hdiff](http://punbb.informer.com/download/hdiff/hdiff-1.3.1_to_1.3.2.html) and consider porting the CSS-changes manually.

Probably not.

#### Re: PunBB 1.3.2

I've updated from 1.3 to 1.3.2 using the files in punbb-1.3\_to\_1.3.2-changed\_files.zip

After uploading the files the forum stop working showing this message:
"Your PunBB database is out-of-date and must be upgraded in order to continue. Please run db\_update.php in order to complete the upgrade process."

I had to edit the config table in the database and delete the cache files, none on this were on a README or any file in the zip package.

Another weird thing is that the link to the db\_update.php script was exposed to every visitor! anyone could click on that and start the upgrade process. I don't know if this is normal but it looked weird to me ![hmm](https://punbb.informer.com/forums/img/smilies/hmm.png)

Well, how would it know who to show the link to? If it showed it only to the IP stored on your admin's account, it could make fixing your forum nearly impossible if your IP changes.

### PunBB 1.3.4

**PunBB 1.3.4** has been released. The main change since 1.3.3 is the fix of the possible XSS vulnerability in profile.php on password and e-mail change (reported by Richard Sammet). As usual, the hotfix for older versions is released as well, which resolves the same security issue.

* a lot of bugs fixed (CSS & markup, defects in language files, correct response header placement upon errors, hook rearrangements, parsing posts in feeds, correct language pack detection during the final stage of the install process);
* contains fixes of security flaws (which were fixed by hotfixes in previous versions);
* it is now possible to limit searches to topic subjects or message bodies;
* users are not allowed to change their e-mails without entering their passwords first.

The already existing styles and language packs should be checked for compatibility with the version 1.3.3 before the latter is installed. After checking, the version 1.3.3 may be installed.

### PunBB.Net beta has been released!

We've been working on this project for quite a long time, trying to do our best to create a completely new product, but one that users are already
familiar with. Now we are glad to present new PunBB.Net beta!

PunBB.NET is a forum written using the ASP.NET technology.

This forum is simple, fast and lightweight. The forum's core itself is only a basis, which allows attaching various extensions to it. This makes it
possible for you to have a discussion board, which can be fine-tuned to meet all your requirements prefectly.

PunBB.NET is inspired by PunBB, being its child project. Both these forums utilize similar layouts and functionality, and they both are released under the GPL license.

The main difference between PunBB.NET and PunBB lies in the technology of their implementation.

PunBB.NET beta is the first public version of PunBB.NET.

For more details visit [PunBB.NET page](https://punbb.informer.com/wiki/punbb.net/start).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
