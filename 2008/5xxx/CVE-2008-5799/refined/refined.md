The provided content is a security bulletin for TYPO3, specifically related to CVE-2008-5799.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple third-party TYPO3 extensions contained vulnerabilities:
    - SQL Injection vulnerabilities were found in "advcalendar", "cms_poll", "eluna_pagecomments" and "fsmi_people"
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were found in "eluna_pagecomments" and "fsmi_people"
    - Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability was found in "rtgdictionary"

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - SQL Injection
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   - Arbitrary Code Execution

**Impact of exploitation:**
   - **SQL Injection:** Could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially leading to data breaches, loss of data integrity, or complete compromise of the application.
    - **XSS:** Could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing attacks, or defacement of the website.
   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:** Exploitation through vulnerable third-party extensions, most likely via web requests targeting the affected extensions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to send requests to the vulnerable extensions, typically through a web browser. The attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated.
