Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-5587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue in phpPgAdmin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `_language` parameter, before using it in an `include` statement. This allows an attacker to specify paths outside of the intended directory.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `_language` parameter, which is used to determine which language file to include, does not sufficiently validate the input it receives. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary file paths.
*   **Unsafe `include()` Usage:** The `include("./lang/recoded/{$_language}.php");` statement directly includes files based on user-supplied data without proper sanitization or validation, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server that the web server process has access to. This can include sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, and application source code.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The ability to read arbitrary files can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, which could be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter:** The primary attack vector is through manipulating the `_language` parameter in an HTTP request (GET or POST).
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) in the `_language` parameter to navigate outside of the intended language file directory.
*   **Null Byte Injection:** The exploit also includes a null byte (`%00`) at the end of the crafted path, which was a common technique to bypass certain file inclusion checks in older PHP versions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where phpPgAdmin is hosted.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `_language` parameter.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability is located in `phpPgAdmin-4.2.1/index.php` and `phpPgAdmin-4.2.1/libraries/lib.inc.php`.
* The `lib.inc.php` script determines the language file based on the `_language` request variable, session variable, or HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE.
* If the `_language` parameter is set, it directly includes the specified file using `include("./lang/recoded/{$_language}.php");`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit example shows how to use the `_language` parameter to read the `/etc/passwd` file.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in later versions of phpPgAdmin.
*   Multiple sources confirm this vulnerability and provide similar details, including exploit examples.

This information should be sufficient to understand the core aspects of the CVE-2008-5587 vulnerability.
