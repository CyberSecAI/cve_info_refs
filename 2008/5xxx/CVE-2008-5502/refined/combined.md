Huge thanks to Jesse Ruderman for helping to reduce this massive testcase. These lines crash js trunk shell at 0x0000000006b30000.
This also asserts debug shell at "Assertion failure: nbytes != 0, at jsapi.cpp:1841". Related to [bug 421623](/show_bug.cgi?id=421623 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - \"Assertion failure: nbytes != 0\" with setter, watch, [].map") or [bug 457521](/show_bug.cgi?id=457521 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ js_DecompileValueGenerator]")?
Nominating security sensitive because they crash at this scary address. Nominating wanted-1.9.0.x as well because we have seen variants of this testcase crashing 1.9.0.x.Flags: wanted1.9.0.x?Flags: blocking1.9.1?

Here is a simplified test case:
~/m/31-ff/js/src $ cat ~/s/x.js
var x = "<";
while (x.length < 12000000)
x += x;
<e4x>{x}</e4x>;
~/m/31-ff/js/src $ ./Linux\_All\_DBG.OBJ/js ~/s/x.js
segmentation fault
The reason for the bug is that GetXMLEntity assumes that FastAppendChar is infallible and continues to read characters from the buffer.

I've discovered a 1.9.0.x testcase that crashes at js\_DeflateString (not an easy one to find, required lots of CPU time) which I've just sent to Jesse for further reduction. Will comment when it's done.

This one applies cleanly and resolves the crash. The shell now shows "typein:17: InternalError: script stack space quota is exhausted" instead of crashing. Bringing over review. Re-requesting approval1.9.0.4 now that the testcase is found.

More comprehensive testing showed 1.8.1.x branch isn't affected by this at all - obsoleting patch. The shell works as expected.

patch for 1.9.0.x - v2
Would you mind getting an independent review on the port -- we don't want any bad branch merges and there are some differences in the branch version of the engine that might have hidden implications. Either Igor or Brian is fine.
We're closing down 1.9.0.4, so request approval on the next review.

The exception is expected on 1.9.\* as the XML parser uses script stack quota space in 1.9.\* and the space is limited to prevent DOS.

Hm, do you mean that the shell terminates with some out-of-something exception while browser simply hangs? If so, could try to capture a stack trace at some moment when the browser busy executing something?

It's a sample of a hang, so instead of a single stack trace, you see a tree representing hundreds of stack traces.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2008-60

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.0.5/1.8.1.19)

Announced
December 16, 2008
Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.19
* Firefox 3.0.5
* SeaMonkey 1.1.14
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.19

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser
engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes
showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume
that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and could be
vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not the default
setting and we strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in
mail. Without further investigation we cannot rule out the possibility that for
some of these an attacker might be able to prepare memory for exploitation
through some means other than JavaScript such as large images.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be installed.

### References

Daniel Veditz, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the layout engine which affected both Firefox 2 and Firefox 3. David Baron reported a crash in the layout engine which only affected Firefox 2 as well as a crash in the layout engine which only affected Firefox 3.
