Subject: CVE request: CUPS DoS via RSS subscriptions

Hello!

I'd like to get a CVE assigned for the RSS subscription DoS mentioned
here[1].  It seems that CUPS upstream already fixed[2] the issue[3] in
their 1.3.8 release.  Prior to 1.3.8, the server can be made to crash
when visiting a malicious website due to CUPS general CSRF issues.

Thanks,

-Kees

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: cups

The CUPS daemon (/usr/sbin/cupsd) which listens by default on port 631/tcp, crashes when more than 100 RSS Subscriptions are added. No authentication is required to perform such action. The caveat is that by default - at least on Ubuntu and openSuse - the daemon only accepts connections from localhost as specified by the default configuration settings (/etc/cups/cupsd.conf). However, the attack can be of remote nature by tricking the victim user to visit a specially-crafted page. Such page would forge the 'add rss subscription' request 101 times which causes the CUPS daemon to crash.

The CUPS daemon runs by default on Ubuntu, openSuse and probably other GNU/Linux distributions. Additionally, this vulnerability can be replicated against CUPS daemons using default settings. Since no authentication is required to add new RSS subscriptions, the CUPS administrator does not need to be logged in during exploitation.

It is not known whether the crash can lead to command execution, further debugging/investigation is required. However, the daemon runs as root on both Ubuntu and openSuse (and probably other distributions), which means that given that command execution is possible, this bug would lead to a full compromise of the targeted system.

I'll deal with the jaunty/Debian update. I was fairly sure that <http://www.cups.org/strfiles/2774/str2774.patch> fixed it (in cups 1.3.8), I just get a live-locked browser (tons of message boxes), but cupsd stays alive. I followed up to the Debian bug.

@Martin: check out the comments on <http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/pwning-ubuntu-via-cups/>

someone figured out why ubuntu hardy does NOT require auth to add rss subscriptions (cupsd dies completely when visiting "evil" page), whereas ubuntu intrepid DOES require auth.

copied and pasted:

"

TH responds:

Problem solved:

Hardy’s version: 1.3.7-1ubuntu3.1

Intrepid’s version: 1.3.9-2

<http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/cups>

<http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/cupsys>

From cups-1.3.8 CHANGES.txt:

- The scheduler now ensures that the RSS directory has the correct permissions.

"

hope that helps.

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier CVE-2008-5183 to

the following vulnerability:

cupsd in CUPS before 1.3.8 allows local users, and possibly remote

attackers, to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by adding a

large number of RSS Subscriptions, which triggers a NULL pointer

dereference. NOTE: this issue can be triggered remotely by leveraging

CVE-2008-5184.

So from looking at cups 1.3.7 on Fedora 8, here is what I see:

(gdb) bt
#0  create_subscription (con=0xb88975c0, uri=0xb889ae00) at ipp.c:5858
#1  0xb7facba7 in cupsdProcessIPPRequest (con=0xb88975c0) at ipp.c:615
#2  0xb7f88bfc in cupsdReadClient (con=0xb88975c0) at client.c:2253
#3  0xb7fc0606 in cupsdDoSelect (timeout=1) at select.c:537
#4  0xb7f98710 in main (argc=1, argv=0xbfdd6194) at main.c:817
(gdb) list
5853        else if (printer)
5854          cupsdLogMessage(CUPSD_LOG_DEBUG,
5855                          "Added subscription %d for printer \"%s\"",
5856                          sub->id, printer->name);
5857        else
5858          cupsdLogMessage(CUPSD_LOG_DEBUG, "Added subscription %d for server",
5859                          sub->id);
5860
5861        sub->interval = interval;
5862        sub->lease    = lease;
(gdb) print sub
$1 = (cupsd_subscription_t *) 0x0

It would appear to be a NULL pointer dereference.  It seems that this call a
few lines above the snippet shown above:
 sub = cupsdAddSubscription(mask, printer, job, recipient, 0);

will return NULL when the hardcoded value of 100 subscriptions is hit.  So really
the issu here is a lack of error checking which results in a NULL dereference
crash.  The upstream fix could still obviously let a local authenticated user
crash the server.

I'm not sure why yet, but this doesn't crash cups 1.2.4 for me (which it should).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: cups

The CUPS daemon (/usr/sbin/cupsd) which listens by default on port 631/tcp, crashes when more than 100 RSS Subscriptions are added. No authentication is required to perform such action. The caveat is that by default - at least on Ubuntu and openSuse - the daemon only accepts connections from localhost as specified by the default configuration settings (/etc/cups/cupsd.conf). However, the attack can be of remote nature by tricking the victim user to visit a specially-crafted page. Such page would forge the 'add rss subscription' request 101 times which causes the CUPS daemon to crash.

The CUPS daemon runs by default on Ubuntu, openSuse and probably other GNU/Linux distributions. Additionally, this vulnerability can be replicated against CUPS daemons using default settings. Since no authentication is required to add new RSS subscriptions, the CUPS administrator does not need to be logged in during exploitation.

It is not known whether the crash can lead to command execution, further debugging/investigation is required. However, the daemon runs as root on both Ubuntu and openSuse (and probably other distributions), which means that given that command execution is possible, this bug would lead to a full compromise of the targeted system.

I'll deal with the jaunty/Debian update. I was fairly sure that <http://www.cups.org/strfiles/2774/str2774.patch> fixed it (in cups 1.3.8), I just get a live-locked browser (tons of message boxes), but cupsd stays alive. I followed up to the Debian bug.

@Martin: check out the comments on <http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/pwning-ubuntu-via-cups/>

someone figured out why ubuntu hardy does NOT require auth to add rss subscriptions (cupsd dies completely when visiting "evil" page), whereas ubuntu intrepid DOES require auth.

copied and pasted:

"

TH responds:

Problem solved:

Hardy’s version: 1.3.7-1ubuntu3.1

Intrepid’s version: 1.3.9-2

<http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/cups>

<http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/cupsys>

From cups-1.3.8 CHANGES.txt:

- The scheduler now ensures that the RSS directory has the correct permissions.

"

hope that helps.

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier CVE-2008-5183 to

the following vulnerability:

cupsd in CUPS before 1.3.8 allows local users, and possibly remote

attackers, to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by adding a

large number of RSS Subscriptions, which triggers a NULL pointer

dereference. NOTE: this issue can be triggered remotely by leveraging

CVE-2008-5184.

CVE-2008-5183 is not fixed anywhere, not even latest upstream. However, it is just an authenticated local DoS, and thus very low-priority.

| [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=473901#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-12-01 13:03:13 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2008-5183](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-5183) to the following vulnerability:  cupsd in CUPS before 1.3.8 allows local users, and possibly remote attackers, to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by adding a large number of RSS Subscriptions, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference.  NOTE: this issue can be triggered remotely by leveraging [CVE-2008-5184](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-5184).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- libxml2
An integer overflow in libxml2 could lead to memory corruption and
arbitrary code execution (CVE-2008-4226).
Affected Products: all
- phpMyAdmin
An update of phpMyAdmin fixed the following issues:
- CVE-2008-1149: SQL injection, CSRF attacks using crafted cookies
- CVE-2008-1567: local users can steal session information/credentials
- CVE-2008-1924: in a shared host environment users with CREAT
permissions can read arbitrary files
- CVE-2008-3456: cross-site framing attack
- CVE-2008-3457: user-assisted XSS attack
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.2, 10.3
- lighttpd
An update of lighttpd fixed the following issues:
- CVE-2008-4298: DoS via memory leak in the http\_request\_parse function
- CVE-2008-4359: bypass access restrictions
- CVE-2008-4360: bypass access restrictions
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.2, 10.3
- OpenOffice\_org
An update of OpenOffice\_org fixes an integer overflow in the WMF
handler (CVE-2008-2237) and multiple bugs in the EMF parser
(CVE-2008-2238).
Additionally several non-security fixes were added.
Affected Products: all
- imp
A cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been fixed in
imp (CVE-2008-4182).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- clamav
A version update to clamav 0.94.1 fixes an off-by-one buffer
overflow in the get\_unicode\_name() function (CVE-2008-5050).
The new version additionally contains other non-security fixes.
Affected Products: all
- acroread
The acroread package was update to fix several security
vulnerabilities in the JavaScript engine (CVE-2008-2992,
CVE-2008-2549, CVE-2008-4812, CVE-2008-4813, CVE-2008-4817,
CVE-2008-4816, CVE-2008-4814, CVE-2008-4815).
Affected Products: all

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

Not really hardcoded -- it is settable with the 'MaxSubscriptions'
directive.  I had just reproduced the bug with CUPS 1.3.9 at FreeBSD.
MaxSubscriptions was set to 3 to ease the PoC.  Just repeated
invocations of 'lpr -m <somefile>' were crashing cups daemon
reproducibly.

The attached patch fixes the things for me, but perhaps it needs
some more polishing.  Will try to take a fresh look at this tomorrow.

Mike, please, take a look at this!
