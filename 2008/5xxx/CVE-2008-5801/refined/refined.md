    *   **Affected Versions:** 0.1.9 and below
    *   **Vulnerability Type:** Arbitrary Code Execution
    *   **Severity:** HIGH

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   SQL Injection: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input leading to the execution of malicious SQL queries, this affects the advCalendar, CMS Poll system, eLuna Page Comments, and Wir ber uns extensions.
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Inadequate handling of user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages, this affects the eLuna Page Comments and Wir ber uns extensions.
*   Arbitrary Code Execution: Unspecified vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code, this affects the Dictionary extension.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   SQL Injection: Could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and potential unauthorized access to the database.
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Could allow attackers to steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface web pages.
*   Arbitrary Code Execution: Could lead to complete system compromise, allowing an attacker to install malware, steal data, or control the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   SQL Injection and XSS attacks would be through web requests to the vulnerable extensions by manipulating input parameters.
*   Arbitrary Code Execution could happen via a web request, by exploiting a vulnerability that allows code to be executed on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker would need the ability to make web requests to the vulnerable web application.
* No specific user role or privilege would be needed.

**Additional Notes:**
* The bulletin recommends that users uninstall vulnerable extensions where no updates are available.
* The bulletin provides links to download updated versions of the extensions where fixes are available.
* The bulletin advises users to follow the recommendations provided in the TYPO3 Security Guide.
