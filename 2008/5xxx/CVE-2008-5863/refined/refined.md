Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5863

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection (Blind)

**Root Cause:** The `locator.php` script in Userlocator 3.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `y` parameter within the `get_user` action.

**Weaknesses:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before incorporating it into a SQL query.
- The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection, meaning that the attacker cannot directly see the results of the query but can infer them through the application's behavior (e.g., changes in response length).

**Impact:**
- An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, including user passwords.
- The vulnerability can potentially lead to full database compromise, allowing an attacker to modify or delete data.

**Attack Vector:**
- The attack is performed remotely through HTTP requests.
- The attacker manipulates the `y` parameter in the `locator.php?action=get_user` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker uses a script to automate the process of extracting the data byte by byte, as a blind sql injection does not provide immediate data returns.

**More Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to extract user passwords by injecting SQL code into the `y` parameter.
- The exploit first checks if the application is vulnerable and if the database prefix can be determined.
- The exploit then iterates through each character of the password hash, using a blind SQL injection technique. This method compares the lengths of responses received from crafted queries with different ASCII values to extract the password.
