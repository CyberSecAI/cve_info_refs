        "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to 'go.php' with malicious SQL code in the 'id' parameter.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. They do not need any special privileges or local access."
