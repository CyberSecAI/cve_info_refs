The upstream report is here:

As best as I can tell, it's for real.

Thanks.

```
```
Package: zaptel
Version: 1.4.11~dfsg-3
Severity: grave
Tags: pending security

Impact: local privileges escalation
Version: all versions (Now fixed in SVN, rev 4588)
Upstream issue: <http://bugs.digium.com/view.php?id=13954>

Fix for Etch version: attached dpatch
Fix for Lenny version: <http://svn.debian.org/viewsvn/pkg-voip?rev=6507&view=rev>

Some older Zaptel drivers do not apply input validation on the sync
field from the ioctl ZT_SPANCONFIG . This is sent on /dev/zap/ctl ,
which in Debian is writable to the group dialout.

In Zaptel this ioctl is mostly handled by the specific spanconfig
function of the low-level driver. Thus this will not have any impact
unless someone has the matching hardware.

* torisa.c is a driver for the old ISA dual-span T1 card, which I believe
  nobody actually uses.
* tor2.c is the driver for the Zapata Telephony Tormenta 2 card quad
  T1/E1 card. Still sold today.

Those two drivers use one specific field from the ioctl struct as an
array index and write there, assuming it is between 0 and 1 (torisa) or
3 (tor2). So we have a nice way to write over many places in kernel
space. The value to write, though, is not easy to control and can't even
be 0.

* wct1xxp.c is the driver for Digium's earlier single-span E1 cards
  (now deprecated: E100P and T100P.
* wcte11xp is the driver for Digium's TE110P, which was was slightly
  better, but replaced is now EOL.

The issue with those two is that the value from this field is written to
a register, while we only wanted to get its first bit. I'm still not
sure if it has any interesting impact for the user, but it is definetly
misbehaving.

Analog cards do not have a spanconfig method. Our package also includes
several other drivers for digital cards that do have a spanconfig method
(cwain, qozap, zaphfc, vzaphfc and ztgsm in Etch, and in Lenny: also
ds1x1f) but none of them seem to have this problem.

Would someone who can test a fixed Debian package please speak up?

Tzafrir, could you do that if we send you packages pre-release?

I don't have that specific hardware. I can test it one hardwares I do
have to show it didn't break anything.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
