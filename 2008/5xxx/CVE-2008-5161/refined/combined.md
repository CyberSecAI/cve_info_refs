## SSH CBC vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#958563

Original Release Date: 2008-11-24 | Last Revised: 2009-01-12

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in SSH messages that employ CBC mode that may allow an attacker to recover plaintext from a block of ciphertext.

### Description

| The Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that creates a secure channel between two networked devices in order to allow data to be exchanged. SSH can create this secure channel by using Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode encryption. This mode adds a feedback mechanism to a block cipher that operates in a way that ensures that each block is used to modify the encryption of the next block.  SSH contains a vulnerability in the way certain types of errors are handled. Attacks leveraging this vulnerabilty would lead to the loss of the SSH session. According to [CPNI Vulnerability Advisory SSH](http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Docs/Vulnerability_Advisory_SSH.txt):*If exploited, this attack can potentially allow an attacker to recover up to 32 bits of plaintext from an arbitrary block of ciphertext from a connection secured using the SSH protocol in the standard configuration. If OpenSSH is used in the standard configuration, then the attacker's success probability for recovering 32 bits of plaintext is 2^{-18}. A variant of the attack against OpenSSH in the standard configuration can verifiably recover 14 bits of plaintext with probability 2^{-14}. The success probability of the attack for other implementations of SSH is not known.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to recover up to 32 bits of plaintext from an arbitrary block of ciphertext. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Use CTR Mode**  SSH can be done using Counter (CTR) mode encryption. This mode generates the keystream by encrypting successive values of a "counter" function. For more information see the [Block Cipher Modes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation) article on wikipedia.In order to mitigate this vulnerabilty SSH can be setup to use CTR mode rather CBC mode. According to [CPNI Vulnerability Advisory SSH](http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Docs/Vulnerability_Advisory_SSH.txt):*The most straightforward solution is to use CTR mode instead of CBC mode, since this renders SSH resistant to the attack. An RFC already exists to standardise counter mode for use in SSH (RFC 4344) ...* |

### [PuTTY](#MAPG-7L6HCF) Affected

Notified:  November 07, 2008  Updated: January 05, 2009

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The latest release (0.60) of PuTTY will always preferentially select CTR-mode ciphers over CBC-mode, and cannot even be configured by the user to do otherwise. Therefore, it is immune to this vulnerability when talking to any server which supports CTR mode.

Development snapshots of PuTTY beginning with 2008-11-27 will contain a countermeasure which avoids leaking information through this attack even when operating in CBC mode. Future releases of PuTTY will also contain this countermeasure.

(That is, the countermeasures will prevent PuTTY from leaking information about data previously sent from the server to the client. Protecting data sent from client to server, such as passwords, must be done by the server.)

We are currently not treating this vulnerability as severe enough to warrant an emergency security release.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=472068#c0)  Gilbert Sebenste    2008-11-18 16:08:54 UTC  ``` Description of problem: OpenSSH has a security flaw which, if exploited, the attack can potentially allow an attacker to recover up to 32 bits of plaintext from an arbitrary block of  ciphertext from a connection secured using the SSH protocol in  the standard configuration. If OpenSSH is used in the standard  configuration, then the attacker's success probability for  recovering 32 bits of plaintext is 2^{-18}. A variant of the  attack against OpenSSH in the standard configuration recovers 14  bits of plaintext with probability 2^{-14}. The success probability  of the attack for other implementations of SSH is not known.  Article here: <http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Docs/Vulnerability_Advisory_SSH.txt>  And  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 4.8p1 and earlier   How reproducible: Always   Steps to Reproduce: 1. See URLs for details. 2. 3.    Actual results: This is not supposed to happen...   Expected results: but it happens.   Additional info: Although this is a security-sensitive bug, it is now widely known, in part due to the info given on the SANS Internet Storm Center.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=472068#c1)  Gilbert Sebenste    2008-11-18 16:12:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=472068#c0))  > Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 4.8p1 and earlier  That should read 4.7p1 and earlier, sorry for the typo.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=472068#c2)  Tomas Mraz    2008-11-18 17:27:28 UTC  ``` It is inherent weakness of the ssh2 protocol.

OpenSSH Security Advisory: cbc.adv
This is the second revision of this advisory, correcting an error in
the estimated number of connection attempts required for a successful
attack.
Regarding the "Plaintext Recovery Attack Against SSH" reported as
CPNI-957037[1]:
The OpenSSH team has been made aware of an attack against the SSH
protocol version 2 by researchers at the University of London.
Unfortunately, due to the report lacking any detailed technical
description of the attack and CPNI's unwillingness to share necessary
information, we are unable to properly assess its impact.
Based on the description contained in the CPNI report and a slightly
more detailed description forwarded by CERT this issue appears to be
substantially similar to a known weakness in the SSH binary packet
protocol first described in 2002 by Bellare, Kohno and Namprempre[2].
The new component seems to be an attack that can recover 14 bits of
plaintext with a success probability of 2^-14, though we suspect this
underestimates the work required by a practical attack.
For most SSH usage scenarios, this attack has a very low likelihood of
being carried out successfully - each attempt has a low probability
of success and each failure will cause connection termination with a
fatal error. It is therefore very unlikely for an interactive session
to be usefully attacked using this protocol weakness: an attacker would
expect around 11356 connection-killing attempts before they are likely
to succeed. This level of disruption would certainly be noticed and it
is highly unlikely that any user would retry the connection enough times
for the attack to succeed.
The usage pattern where the attack is most likely to succeed is where an
automated connection is configured to retry indefinitely in the event of
errors. In this case, it might be possible to recover on average 44 bits
of plaintext per hour (assuming a very fast 10 connections per second).
Implementing a limit on the number of connection retries (e.g. 256) is
sufficient to render the attack infeasible for this case.
AES CTR mode and arcfour ciphers are not vulnerable to this attack at
all. These may be preferentially selected by placing the following
directive in sshd\_config and ssh\_config:
Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes256-ctr,arcfour256,arcfour,aes128-cbc,aes256-cbc
A future version of OpenSSH may make CTR mode ciphers the default and/or
implement other countermeasures, but at present we do not feel that this
issue is serious enough to make an emergency release.

## Situation

 This technical note describes a design flaw in the SSH protocol use of
block ciphers in cipher block chaining mode; lists the affected
Attachmate products; and provides solutions and workaround options to
address the vulnerability.
## Resolution

## Vulnerability Details

A design flaw in the SSH protocol use of block ciphers in cipher
block chaining (CBC) mode (as specified in IETF RFC 4253) could allow a
man-in-the-middle attacker to recover up to four bytes of plaintext per
connection. Although the severity of the attack is considered high, the
likelihood of a successful attack is considered low, as this attack
would result in repeatedly terminating the user’s SSH connection.

For details, see the US-CERT web site at <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/958563>.

Because this flaw is in the design of the protocol, the CSIRTUK
reports states that they “expect any RFC-compliant SSH implementation to
be vulnerable to some form of the attack.”

## Products Affected When Using CBC-mode Block Ciphers

All products and versions listed in the Applies To section of this
note are affected by this vulnerability when configured to use CBC-mode
block ciphers.

## Workaround Options

The primary recommended workaround is to use counter-mode ciphers (CTR) where supported, instead of CBC-mode block ciphers.

Many of the affected products listed in the Applies To section of
this note do not support CTR. Attachmate has been incorporating updates
into newer releases of the affected products to support the CTR
workaround (as reflected in the "Not Affected" lists above, and the
update details below), and plans to continue that practice.

To further secure your SSH servers, you can configure the AllowHosts
and DenyHosts ACLs to prevent connections from clients in untrusted
networks. In Reflection for Secure IT Windows Server 7.0 or higher, you
can also configure IP Blocking (on the Authentication pane) to lock out
repeated failed connection attempts. IP blocking applies only to
password authentication (both traditional and Keyboard Interactive). **Note:** If you disable password authentication or Keyboard Interactive authentication, then IP Blocking no longer applies.

Finally, configuring SSH servers for user authentication methods that
do not require passwords to be sent across the wire (specifically, the
"password" and "password over keyboard-interactive" methods) reduces the
chance of compromising user accounts.

## Specific Product Solutions

Product updates are available to correct this vulnerability for some
affected Attachmate applications. Maintained customers can obtain
product updates from the Attachmate Download Library as directed below.
For those products where an update is not yet available (products not
listed below), please refer to [Workaround Options](#Workaround_Options).

### Reflection 2014 and 2011

and Reflection 2011 products (including Reflection Pro 2014, Reflection X
2014, Reflection X 2011 and Reflection Suite for X 2011), we also
prevent premature disconnection during password or keyboard-interactive
authentication to avoid the plaintext recovery attack against CBC
ciphers vulnerability and disclosing sensitive authentication data, such
as passwords.

### Reflection 2008 Products R1 Service Pack 1

This vulnerability does not affect the following versions when either
AES counter-mode ciphers (aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr or aes256-ctr),

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Synopsis

Low: openssh security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1287)

## Topic

Updated openssh packages that fix a security issue, a bug, and add
enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

OpenSSH is OpenBSD's SSH (Secure Shell) protocol implementation. These
packages include the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and
server.

A flaw was found in the SSH protocol. An attacker able to perform a
man-in-the-middle attack may be able to obtain a portion of plain text from
an arbitrary ciphertext block when a CBC mode cipher was used to encrypt
SSH communication. This update helps mitigate this attack: OpenSSH clients
and servers now prefer CTR mode ciphers to CBC mode, and the OpenSSH server
now reads SSH packets up to their full possible length when corruption is
detected, rather than reporting errors early, reducing the possibility of
successful plain text recovery. (CVE-2008-5161)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* the ssh client hung when trying to close a session in which a background

process still held tty file descriptors open. With this update, this
so-called "hang on exit" error no longer occurs and the ssh client closes
the session immediately. (BZ#454812)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

* the SFTP server can now chroot users to various directories, including

a user's home directory, after log in. A new configuration option --
ChrootDirectory -- has been added to "/etc/ssh/sshd\_config" for setting
this up (the default is not to chroot users). Details regarding configuring
this new option are in the sshd\_config(5) manual page. (BZ#440240)

* the executables which are part of the OpenSSH FIPS module which is being

validated will check their integrity and report their FIPS mode status to
the system log or to the terminal. (BZ#467268, BZ#492363)

All OpenSSH users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues and add these
enhancements. After installing this update, the OpenSSH server daemon
(sshd) will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>
