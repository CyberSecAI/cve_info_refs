        "data": "### Overview\nA vulnerability exists in SSH messages that employ CBC mode that may allow an attacker to recover plaintext from a block of ciphertext.\n\n### Description\nThe Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that creates a secure channel between two networked devices in order to allow data to be exchanged. SSH can create this secure channel by using Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode encryption. This mode adds a feedback mechanism to a block cipher that operates in a way that ensures that each block is used to modify the encryption of the next block.  SSH contains a vulnerability in the way certain types of errors are handled. Attacks leveraging this vulnerabilty would lead to the loss of the SSH session. According to CPNI Vulnerability Advisory SSH:*If exploited, this attack can potentially allow an attacker to recover up to 32 bits of plaintext from an arbitrary block of ciphertext from a connection secured using the SSH protocol in the standard configuration. If OpenSSH is used in the standard configuration, then the attacker's success probability for recovering 32 bits of plaintext is 2^{-18}. A variant of the attack against OpenSSH in the standard configuration can verifiably recover 14 bits of plaintext with probability 2^{-14}. The success probability of the attack for other implementations of SSH is not known.*\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker may be able to recover up to 32 bits of plaintext from an arbitrary block of ciphertext.\n\n### Solution\nWe are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.\n\n**Use CTR Mode**  SSH can be done using Counter (CTR) mode encryption. This mode generates the keystream by encrypting successive values of a \"counter\" function. For more information see the Block Cipher Modes article on wikipedia.In order to mitigate this vulnerabilty SSH can be setup to use CTR mode rather CBC mode. According to CPNI Vulnerability Advisory SSH:*The most straightforward solution is to use CTR mode instead of CBC mode, since this renders SSH resistant to the attack. An RFC already exists to standardise counter mode for use in SSH (RFC 4344) ...*\n\n### Vendor Information\n\n**Affected Vendors:**\nBitvise, FiSSH, Icon Labs, OSSH, OpenSSH, PuTTY, Redback Networks, Inc., SSH Communications Security Corp, TTSSH, VanDyke Software, Wind River Systems, Inc.\n\n",

It is therefore very unlikely for an interactive session\nto be usefully attacked using this protocol weakness: an attacker would\nexpect around 11356 connection-killing attempts before they are likely\nto succeed. This level of disruption would certainly be noticed and it\nis highly unlikely that any user would retry the connection enough times\nfor the attack to succeed.\nThe usage pattern where the attack is most likely to succeed is where an\nautomated connection is configured to retry indefinitely in the event of\nerrors. In this case, it might be possible to recover on average 44 bits\nof plaintext per hour (assuming a very fast 10 connections per second).\nImplementing a limit on the number of connection retries (e.g. 256) is\nsufficient to render the attack infeasible for this case.\nAES CTR mode and arcfour ciphers are not vulnerable to this attack at\nall. These may be preferentially selected by placing the following\ndirective in sshd\\_config and ssh\\_config:\nCiphers aes128-ctr,aes256-ctr,arcfour256,arcfour,aes128-cbc,aes256-cbc\nA future version of OpenSSH may make CTR mode ciphers the default and/or\nimplement other countermeasures, but at present we do not feel that this\nissue is serious enough to make an emergency release.\n[1] http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Docs/Vulnerability\\_Advisory\\_SSH.txt\n[2] http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/yoshi/papers/TISSEC04/",
