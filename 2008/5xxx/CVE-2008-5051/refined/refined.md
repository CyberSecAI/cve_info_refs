Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5051:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `PostID` parameter of the `com_jb2` Joomla component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `PostID` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive data stored in the database, such as usernames and passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a specially crafted `PostID` parameter. The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the `jos_users` table.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft the injection payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit example provided uses a `UNION SELECT` to extract usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table of a Joomla installation.
*   The content explicitly mentions the vulnerable module name as `com_jb2` and script as `Joomla`.
*   A Google Dork is provided, which can be used to find vulnerable instances of the `com_jb2` component.
*   The provided exploit example is: `-9999'/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/1,unhex(hex(concat(username,0x3a,password))),3,4,5,6,7+from+jos_users/*`

This information is significantly more detailed than a basic CVE description, providing the exact vulnerable parameter, component, a concrete exploit, and even a google dork.
