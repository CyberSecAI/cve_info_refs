- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The frontend plugin of the "felogin" system extension fails to properly filter user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary JavaScript execution by tricking a website user into following a specially crafted link.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted link that, when clicked, executes malicious JavaScript due to the lack of input filtering in the felogin extension.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious link and trick a user into clicking it.
