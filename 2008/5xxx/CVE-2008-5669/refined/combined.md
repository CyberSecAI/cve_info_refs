# Textpattern CMS 4.0.6 released

02 February 2008

After quite a while and lots of work from many, many people it’s finally here. We have fixed no less than six security issues. Because half of those can be used from the public side, updating is strongly recommended.

Updates should be seamless for the vast majority of people, otherwise make sure that all plugins are also updated to their most recent version, especially admin-side plugins.
