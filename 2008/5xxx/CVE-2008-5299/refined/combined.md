How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: chm2pdf: Major security (temporary dirs) problems
Date: Sun, 12 Oct 2008 01:43:00 +0200
```
Package: chm2pdf
Version: 0.9-2
Severity: grave
Justification: causes non-serious data loss

There are several problems with this package:

1. chm2pdf creates /tmp/chm2pdf/{orig,work}/X directories.
   (Where X is file basename, foo for foo.chm).

   This makes script unusable for other users, i.e. userA runs chm2pdf
   which creates /tmp/chm2pdf with userA owner, userB has no chance to
   create files there

2. Malicious user could prepare directory structure which upon chm2pdf
   execution could cause serious data loss.

from /usr/bin/chm2pdf:

     CHM2PDF_TEMP_WORK_DIR='/tmp/chm2pdf/work'
     CHM2PDF_TEMP_ORIG_DIR='/tmp/chm2pdf/orig'
...
     CHM2PDF_WORK_DIR = CHM2PDF_TEMP_WORK_DIR + os.sep + basename
     CHM2PDF_ORIG_DIR = CHM2PDF_TEMP_ORIG_DIR + os.sep + basename
...
     os.system('rm -r '+CHM2PDF_ORIG_DIR+'/*')
     os.system('rm -r '+CHM2PDF_WORK_DIR+'/*')
.

Malicious user could do e.g.

malicious$ mkdir /tmp/chm2pdf/{orig,work}
malicious$ cd /tmp/chm2pdf/orig
malicious$ for f in `find /home/victim/ -iname \*.chm -print`; do
> ln -s /home/victim/ `basename ${f%%.chm}`
> done

And ask user victim to convert any of his own .chm files.

Thanks.

Hi,

Attached is the diff for my proposed NMU. The new package version has NOT been
uploaded to give you the opportunity to make a better upload to address those

Note that a separate upload is required for lenny.

Subject: Re: chm2pdf: Major security (temporary dirs) problems
Date: Tue, 25 Nov 2008 10:39:23 +0100
```
Hello all,

I definitely oppose the proposed patch and will NOT accept it in chm2pdf (I am one of the two authors)!

Reasons:

1) There are easier ways to avoid the security risks.
2) It destroys the "--dontextract" option which is a *very* useful one!

Let me propose an alternative:

It all has to do with using "tmp" in these 2 lines, right?

CHM2PDF_TEMP_WORK_DIR='/tmp/chm2pdf/work'
CHM2PDF_TEMP_ORIG_DIR='/tmp/chm2pdf/orig'

So, what would you say if I changed "tmp"  to $HOME in the above two lines? Any security concerns here? This way, we keep sane names for the directories, we don't touch tmp, the user and only the user has full control of the directories created - and we can keep the --dontextract option!

Any objections - or suggestions :-) - before I start coding?

PS.: Before you kill me about the use of tmp, bear in mind that this tool was created with the "normal user" in mind (me! :-)))), i.e. for a system where 99% of the time only one user is using it. That user was assumed to (be able to) change the value of the CHM2PDF_TEMP_* variables to whatever fits him - that's why the variables were actually created. Now people start complaining about "malicious users". Oh well...you are all so right - but notice what: we have already stopped talking about how to make the program do its actual job better - we are talking about "cross-cutting concerns"! That is, we now concentrate our energy *not* on the problem we originally had to solve (CHM to PDF conversion), but on things like "where to put the working dir, in /tmp, in $HOME or elsewhere...". :roll:

Umh... I don't think that will do in many scenarios. I am not familiar
with your code (I only stumbled upon this bug report), but please keep
in mind that programs such as this one might often be called by a user
with no writable home directory - Say, web-based processes.

Most authors agree to use secure, unpredictable tempdir functions,
available basically on every language, such as the one suggested by
Raphael. I would recommend you to:

- Default to Raphael's suggestion
- Include a command line switch, so that the user can specify the
  tempdir (or PDF build dir, or whatever nomenclature you find
  suitable).

Well... That's the role of a distribution's QA, isn't it? ;-) We trust
you to be the best person to implement the hard logic and little
details behind it all, but please trust us when advicing on how most
users install their software, at least in Debian settings.

Why so much insistence? First, because if the software is shipped as
part of Debian, a user cannot modify the variables (i.e. the program
will be installed in /usr/bin, owned by root, and not writable by any
system user). Second, most users (and the proportion is growing!) are
not proficient in Python, nor interested in learning how to program,
and, even if I don't like the idea, will just be scared at the idea of
opening a program source in a text editor.

Yes, I know many of those users will have a single-user system. But
still, Linux distributions _still_ have (and will continue to) large
numbers of multi-user settings (i.e. school/university labs, or
company-wide managed terminals, and a very large etcetera - Even a
household with several different users!)

As a distribution, it is our task to ensure all the user cases are
satisfiable the best way possible... even if that's not what you
originally intended. Of course, you are free not to incorporate a
patch in your sources - but that will only mean we will keep it as a
patch (and behaviour difference) in our packaging.
