How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
WinCom LPD Total (wincomlpd) is a commercial line printer daemon for
Windows.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
--------------------------------------
A] buffer-overflow in control filename
--------------------------------------
wincomlpd is affected by a buffer-overflow vulnerability exploitable
during the building of an error string caused by the impossibility of
creating the file specified by the client.
The queues of remote printers are not affected by the problem.
----------------------------------
B] remote administration bypassing
----------------------------------
The administration service which runs on port 13500 is used by the
local and remote admins for managing the wincomlpd server.
The problem here is very simple: the authentication method used by
the program is practically unexistent.
In short an attacker can manage the wincomlpd server without knowing
the admin username and password but simply skipping the auth stage.
This bug can be exploited in at least two ways: writing an alternative
client (the protocol is enough simple so it's not a problem) or just
modifying the admin client program (LPDAdmin.exe).
------------------------------------------------
C] integer memcpy crash in remote administration
------------------------------------------------
The 8 and 16 bit values used in the remote administration protocol for
specifying respectively the length of the strings (like the printer's
name to add) and the size of the data block are signed integers.
That allows an attacker to crash the remote wincomlpd service simply
using negative values like 0x80 or 0xff for the 8 bits numbers and
0x8000 or 0xffff for the data block and so on.
This bug can be also used for exploiting the subsequent vulnerability.
-------------------------------------------
D] buffer-overflow in remote administration
-------------------------------------------
A buffer-overflow is located in the function which copies the data from
the values explained before in a stack buffer.
Naturally the criticality of the above two vulnerabilities is related
to the possibility of bypassing the authentication explained in bug B.
