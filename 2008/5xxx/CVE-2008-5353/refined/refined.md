  "CVE-2008-5353": {
    "description": "A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) related to deserializing calendar objects may allow an untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user running the untrusted applet.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of calendar objects within the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Specifically, the `java.util.Calendar` class's `readObject` method, which is responsible for deserializing objects from a stream, fails to properly validate or sanitize the incoming data, particularly when processing `sun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo` objects. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious serialized object during deserialization that can cause privilege escalation",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure deserialization",
        "Improper validation of object types during deserialization",
        "Lack of sufficient privilege separation during deserialization"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers could achieve privilege escalation by exploiting the deserialization flaw. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing attackers to read and write local files, or execute local applications with the permissions of the user running the applet.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote exploitation via untrusted Java applets or applications.",
		"Maliciously crafted JAR archives, applets, or Java Web Start applications"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious serialized object for deserialization. They must also entice the user to run or load the malicious applet.",
      "required_position": "Remote"
