{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the way multiple anti-virus (AV) software solutions analyze web pages for malicious content. By prepending a valid MZ header (the header for DOS/Windows executable files) to an HTML file and then changing the file extension to a non-executable type like .txt, .jpg, or no extension, the malicious HTML file can bypass AV detection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of file types based solely on extensions.",
      "Inadequate content-based analysis of file structure by AV software, failing to recognize the malicious HTML code hidden behind a valid MZ header.",
      "Exploitation of the behavior of Internet Explorer 6 and 7, which execute HTML code even when embedded in files with incorrect extensions."
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is the bypass of malicious web page detection by numerous antivirus products. This allows attackers to deliver exploits and malicious code to users' systems without being detected, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or malware infection.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Delivery of malicious HTML via web servers disguised as text or image files.",
        "Exploitation of browser handling of file types with embedded HTML.",
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to: 1. Prepend the MZ header to the malicious HTML file. 2. Change the file's extension to a non-executable type. 3. Host the file on a web server. 4. Lure victims to access the malicious file through links on the web page. The attacker must also leverage IE6/7's behavior to execute the HTML code regardless of file extension."
