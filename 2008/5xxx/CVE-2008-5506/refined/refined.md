Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-5506:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of 302 redirects by XMLHttpRequest (XHR) in Mozilla products like Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird. When an XHR is made to a same-origin resource which then 302 redirects to a different domain, the response from the cross-domain resource is incorrectly exposed to the originating site's JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-domain data leakage:** The primary vulnerability is that the response from the cross-domain resource, including headers and body, is made available to the script making the XHR.
- **Inadequate same-origin policy enforcement:**  The same-origin policy, which is intended to prevent scripts from accessing data from other domains, is bypassed when redirects are involved.
- **Exposure of sensitive information:** This allows potentially sensitive information such as URL parameters and content in the response body to be revealed to the requesting domain's JavaScript. Even if cookies are marked as HttpOnly, sensitive data may be contained within other parts of the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker can potentially access data from a different domain than the one where the malicious script is hosted.
- **SSO credential misuse:** In single sign-on (SSO) environments, this vulnerability can be used to exploit session data to mint access tokens for other domains, because HTTPOnly cookie protection is bypassed.
- **Bypass of HttpOnly cookies:**  Although HttpOnly cookies themselves cannot be read directly, the access token that is a response from the redirected domain can be read which may allow privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** A malicious script injected via XSS on a vulnerable website can initiate the vulnerable XHR and read data intended for a different domain.
- **Redirect manipulation:** An attacker may trick a user into accessing a resource from a different domain to which a redirect will occur, enabling sensitive information capture by the attacker's script.
- **Malicious website:** The user could be tricked into opening a malicious website containing a JavaScript that would initiate a vulnerable XHR request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript within the context of a vulnerable browser. This could be done via a malicious website, a compromised website, or XSS attack on a different domain.
- The attacker needs to cause the victim's browser to make a request to a resource on the same domain that redirects to a resource on a different domain.
- The attacker needs to control or know about the target domain or the path that will be 302 redirected.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability affects various Mozilla products including Firefox, SeaMonkey and Thunderbird.
-   Thunderbird is vulnerable if JavaScript is enabled in mail, which is not the default setting.
-   The vulnerability is fixed in:
    -   Firefox 2.0.0.19
    -   Firefox 3.0.5
    -   SeaMonkey 1.1.14
    -   Thunderbird 2.0.0.19

-   A workaround is to disable JavaScript until a patched version is installed.
-   The bug was reported by Marius Schilder of Google Security.

This vulnerability is primarily an information disclosure issue where sensitive data that is not supposed to be accessible across domains is inadvertently revealed through the redirect mechanism of XMLHttpRequest.
