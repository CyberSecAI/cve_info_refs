      "details": "Multiple security vulnerabilities in the Flash Player Plugin for Solaris. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned CVE-2008-5361 to this issue, along with other CVEs related to Flash Player vulnerabilities. The root cause is related to input validation errors in the Flash Player. Specifically, the ActionScript 2 virtual machine fails to verify the size of member elements when performing certain actions. DefineConstantPool accepts an untrusted input value for a \"constant count\" and character elements are not validated when retrieved from a data structure. This could lead to an out-of-bounds read, allowing sensitive data to be exposed, or cause a null pointer dereference and crash.",
