| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=473259#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-11-27 12:55:25 UTC  ``` Reported and fixed by Dann Frazier <dannf>: This is an implementation of David Miller's suggested fix in:   [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=470201](show_bug.cgi?id=470201 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-5029 kernel: Unix sockets kernel panic")  Paraphrasing the description from the above report, it makes sendmsg() block while UNIX garbage collection is in progress. This avoids a situation where child processes continue to queue new FDs over a AF_UNIX socket to a parent which is in the exit path and running garbage collection on these FDs. This contention can result in soft lockups and oom-killing of unrelated processes.  This bug was triggerable after fixing [CVE-2008-5029](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-5029). From Dave Miller, "It's a different bug, but triggerable by the same test program."

hey,
I'm noticing that if I run the unix.c program from <A NAME="-1"></A>[1] in a tight
loop on 2.6.28-rc5, I get frequent soft lockups. Eventually, the OOM
killer kicks in and starts taking out other processes.
I've posted a console log here:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=473259#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-11-27 12:55:25 UTC  ``` Reported and fixed by Dann Frazier <dannf>: This is an implementation of David Miller's suggested fix in:   [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=470201](show_bug.cgi?id=470201 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-5029 kernel: Unix sockets kernel panic")  Paraphrasing the description from the above report, it makes sendmsg() block while UNIX garbage collection is in progress. This avoids a situation where child processes continue to queue new FDs over a AF_UNIX socket to a parent which is in the exit path and running garbage collection on these FDs. This contention can result in soft lockups and oom-killing of unrelated processes.  This bug was triggerable after fixing [CVE-2008-5029](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-5029). From Dave Miller, "It's a different bug, but triggerable by the same test program."  Reproducers: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=470201#c1](show_bug.cgi?id=470201#c1 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-5029 kernel: Unix sockets kernel panic") [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=470201#c7](show_bug.cgi?id=470201#c7 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-5029 kernel: Unix sockets kernel panic")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=473259#c1)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-11-27 12:56:16 UTC  ``` Patch for this bug: <http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=122771908731133&w=2>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=473259#c2)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-11-27 12:58:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 324874](attachment.cgi?id=324874&action=diff "Proposed patch for real-time kernel") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=324874&action=edit "Proposed patch for real-time kernel") Proposed patch for real-time kernel  This patch is to be applied on top of the [CVE-2008-5029](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-5029) fixes.

RHSA-2009:1550 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2009-11-03

2009-11-03
# RHSA-2009:1550 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and multiple bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* when fput() was called to close a socket, the \_\_scm\_destroy() function in

the Linux kernel could make indirect recursive calls to itself. This could,
potentially, lead to a denial of service issue. (CVE-2008-5029, Important)

* the sendmsg() function in the Linux kernel did not block during UNIX

socket garbage collection. This could, potentially, lead to a local denial
of service. (CVE-2008-5300, Important)

* the exit\_notify() function in the Linux kernel did not properly reset the

exit signal if a process executed a set user ID (setuid) application before
exiting. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to elevate their
privileges. (CVE-2009-1337, Important)

* a flaw was found in the Intel PRO/1000 network driver in the Linux

kernel. Frames with sizes near the MTU of an interface may be split across
multiple hardware receive descriptors. Receipt of such a frame could leak
through a validation check, leading to a corruption of the length check. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted packet that
would cause a denial of service or code execution. (CVE-2009-1385,
Important)

* the ADDR\_COMPAT\_LAYOUT and MMAP\_PAGE\_ZERO flags were not cleared when a

setuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to bypass the mmap\_min\_addr protection mechanism and perform a
NULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)

* it was discovered that, when executing a new process, the clear\_child\_tid

pointer in the Linux kernel is not cleared. If this pointer points to a
writable portion of the memory of the new program, the kernel could corrupt
four bytes of memory, possibly leading to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-2848, Important)

* missing initialization flaws were found in getname() implementations in

the IrDA sockets, AppleTalk DDP protocol, NET/ROM protocol, and ROSE
protocol implementations in the Linux kernel. Certain data structures in
these getname() implementations were not initialized properly before being
copied to user-space. These flaws could lead to an information leak.
(CVE-2009-3002, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following

functions in the Linux kernel: pipe\_read\_open(), pipe\_write\_open(), and
pipe\_rdwr\_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i\_pipe pointer could
be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)

Bug fixes:

* this update adds the mmap\_min\_addr tunable and restriction checks to help

prevent unprivileged users from creating new memory mappings below the
minimum address. This can help prevent the exploitation of NULL pointer
dereference bugs. Note that mmap\_min\_addr is set to zero (disabled) by
default for backwards compatibility. (BZ#512642)

* a bridge reference count problem in IPv6 has been fixed. (BZ#457010)
* enforce null-termination of user-supplied arguments to setsockopt().

(BZ#505514)

* the gcc flag "-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks" was added to the kernel

build options. This prevents gcc from optimizing out NULL pointer checks
after the first use of a pointer. NULL pointer bugs are often exploited by
attackers. Keeping these checks is a safety measure. (BZ#511185)

* a check has been added to the IPv4 code to make sure that rt is not NULL,

to help prevent future bugs in functions that call ip\_append\_data() from
being exploitable. (BZ#520300)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use

The problem is that the child processes can still queue new FDs over the AF_UNIX socket to the parents side, while the parent is exit()'ing and (via exit time FD closing) running UNIX garbage collection on those FDs.  There is no easy way at all to fix this.  There isn't something like a one-to-one relationship between sockets and processes, there is rather potentially a many-to-one relationship.  So ideas like "don't allow sending FD over AF_UNIX socket for process that is exit()'ing" are totally out of the question.  One idea that might work, however, is to throttle when UNIX garbage collection is in progress.  I can't say how easy the implementation would be.  The following might work:  1) Add wait_queue to net/unix/garbage.c 2) Create a helper function that sleeps until gc_in_progress is false 3) At the end of unix_gc() where gc_in_progress is cleared to false,    perform a wakeup on the waitq added in #1 4) At all net/unix/af_unix.c calls of scm_send(), first invoke the    "wait until gc_in_progress==false" thing added in #3  This should make sendmsg()'s block while any UNIX garbage collection is in progress.  Note that this will kill scalability in the case where many UNIX sockets are being closed while many other UNIX sockets are doing SCM fp passing.  I don't know how common that is, probably not enough to care.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=470201#c25)  dann frazier    2008-11-25 20:24:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 324662](attachment.cgi?id=324662&action=diff "Implementation of David's suggestion") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=324662&action=edit "Implementation of David's suggestion") Implementation of David's suggestion  Here's my attempt at implementing David's suggestion.

Package        : linux-2.6.24
Vulnerability  : denial of service/privilege escalation
Problem type   : local/remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-3528 CVE-2008-4554 CVE-2008-4576 CVE-2008-4618
                 CVE-2008-4933 CVE-2008-4934 CVE-2008-5025 CVE-2008-5029
                 CVE-2008-5134 CVE-2008-5182 CVE-2008-5300

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2008-3528

    Eugene Teo reported a local DoS issue in the ext2 and ext3
    filesystems.  Local users who have been granted the privileges
    necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted
    filesystem that causes the kernel to output error messages in an
    infinite loop.

CVE-2008-4554

    Milos Szeredi reported that the usage of splice() on files opened
    with O_APPEND allows users to write to the file at arbitrary
    offsets, enabling a bypass of possible assumed semantics of the
    O_APPEND flag.

CVE-2008-4576

    Vlad Yasevich reported an issue in the SCTP subsystem that may
    allow remote users to cause a local DoS by triggering a kernel
    oops.

CVE-2008-4618

    Wei Yongjun reported an issue in the SCTP subsystem that may allow
    remote users to cause a local DoS by triggering a kernel panic.

CVE-2008-4933

    Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfsplus
    filesystem.  Local users who have been granted the privileges
    necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted
    filesystem that causes the kernel to overrun a buffer, resulting
    in a system oops or memory corruption.

CVE-2008-4934

    Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfsplus
    filesystem.  Local users who have been granted the privileges
    necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted
    filesystem that results in a kernel oops due to an unchecked
    return value.

CVE-2008-5025

    Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfs filesystem.
    Local users who have been granted the privileges necessary to
    mount a filesystem would be able to craft a filesystem with a
    corrupted catalog name length, resulting in a system oops or
    memory corruption.

CVE-2008-5029

    Andrea Bittau reported a DoS issue in the unix socket subsystem
    that allows a local user to cause memory corruption, resulting in
    a kernel panic.

CVE-2008-5134

    Johannes Berg reported a remote DoS issue in the libertas wireless
    driver, which can be triggered by a specially crafted beacon/probe
    response.

CVE-2008-5182

    Al Viro reported race conditions in the inotify subsystem that may
    allow local users to acquire elevated privileges.

CVE-2008-5300

    Dann Frazier reported a DoS condition that allows local users to
    cause the out of memory handler to kill off privileged processes
    or trigger soft lockups due to a starvation issue in the unix
    socket subsystem.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.24-6~etchnhalf.7.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6.24 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch

The problem is that the child processes can still queue new FDs over the AF_UNIX socket to the parents side, while the parent is exit()'ing and (via exit time FD closing) running UNIX garbage collection on those FDs.  There is no easy way at all to fix this.  There isn't something like a one-to-one relationship between sockets and processes, there is rather potentially a many-to-one relationship.  So ideas like "don't allow sending FD over AF_UNIX socket for process that is exit()'ing" are totally out of the question.  One idea that might work, however, is to throttle when UNIX garbage collection is in progress.  I can't say how easy the implementation would be.  The following might work:  1) Add wait_queue to net/unix/garbage.c 2) Create a helper function that sleeps until gc_in_progress is false 3) At the end of unix_gc() where gc_in_progress is cleared to false,    perform a wakeup on the waitq added in #1 4) At all net/unix/af_unix.c calls of scm_send(), first invoke the    "wait until gc_in_progress==false" thing added in #3  This should make sendmsg()'s block while any UNIX garbage collection is in progress.  Note that this will kill scalability in the case where many UNIX sockets are being closed while many other UNIX sockets are doing SCM fp passing.  I don't know how common that is, probably not enough to care.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=470201#c25)  dann frazier    2008-11-25 20:24:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 324662](attachment.cgi?id=324662&action=diff "Implementation of David's suggestion") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=324662&action=edit "Implementation of David's suggestion") Implementation of David's suggestion  Here's my attempt at implementing David's suggestion.

## Details

Hugo Dias discovered that the ATM subsystem did not correctly manage

socket counts. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a system hang,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5079](/security/CVE-2008-5079))

It was discovered that the inotify subsystem contained watch removal

race conditions. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5182](/security/CVE-2008-5182))

Dann Frazier discovered that in certain situations sendmsg did not

correctly release allocated memory. A local attacker could exploit

this to force the system to run out of free memory, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2008-5300](/security/CVE-2008-5300))

Helge Deller discovered that PA-RISC stack unwinding was not handled

correctly. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system,

leading do a denial of service. This did not affect official Ubuntu

kernels, but was fixed in the source for anyone performing HPPA kernel

builds. ([CVE-2008-5395](/security/CVE-2008-5395))

It was discovered that the ATA subsystem did not correctly set timeouts. A

local attacker could exploit this to cause a system hang, leading to a

denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5700](/security/CVE-2008-5700))

It was discovered that the ib700 watchdog timer did not correctly check

buffer sizes. A local attacker could send a specially crafted ioctl

to the device to cause a system crash, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2008-5702](/security/CVE-2008-5702))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [linux-image-2.6.27-11-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [2.6.27-11.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/2.6.27-11.27)
* [linux-image-2.6.27-11-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [2.6.27-11.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/2.6.27-11.27)
* [linux-image-2.6.27-11-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [2.6.27-11.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/2.6.27-11.27)

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
