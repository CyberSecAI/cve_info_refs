      "content": "Of the reported issues, several could be used by an attacker to\npartially or fully control object member pointers with addresses of\nhis or her choosing. This may result in write operations into the host\nprocess' memory with data of the attacker's choosing, which is usually a\nserious problem and could lead to code execution.\nThe majority of the issues discovered lead to a out of bounds read,\noften caught by the operating system and converted into an error. For\nexample, in the affected versions of Flash player the following Action\nRecord (ActionScript 2.0) types failed to verify the size of member\nelements (DefineConstantPool, ActionJump, ActionPush, ActionTry), as\nwell as several other Action Record types. These boundary issues become\napparent when Flash movies (.swf files consisting of a series of Action\nRecords or \"tags\") contain data with values for offsets which point to\nregions beyond the end of the Flash file's memory.\n\nIn the case of the DefineConstantPool record we were able supply an\narbitrary constant count. The player then parses constant values\n(strings) from the string table, and continues reading null terminated\nstrings in the adjacent tag data, eventually reading from memory\nadjacent to the Flash movie. References to these values are stored in\na table of constants that can be later accessed using a set of action\nrecords.\n\nFinally, other issues were found that suggest the lack of validation\non the contents of the dictionary data structure. Elements in the\nstructure, e.g. \"characters\" are previously defined using a variety of\ndefine operations. They are subsequent referenced by their \"character\nid\" and inserted in the Flash player workspace. During the retrieval of\nthe character elements from the dictionary, they are not validated to\nin fact exist, and often their structure is not validated prior to use.\nThis typically leads to a null pointer dereference and crash, which is\nmuch less dangerous.",
