Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2008-5194:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `id` parameter in `checkavail.php`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.

**Attack vectors:**

- Specifically, the vulnerable URL is `http://www.site.com/obmp22/checkavail.php?ln=en&id=[SQL injection payload]` and the demonstrated exploit uses a union-based SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable application is identified as Online Booking Manager 2.2.
- The vulnerability is present in the `checkavail.php` file.
- The exploit example uses `union select` to extract `UserName` and `UserPassword` from the `users` table.
- The provided exploit demonstrates how to retrieve usernames and passwords, showcasing the potential for complete database access.
