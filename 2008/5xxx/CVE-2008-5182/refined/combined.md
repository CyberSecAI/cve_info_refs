How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The openSUSE 10.3 kernel was updated to fix various security problems
and bugs. Following security bugs were fixed:
CVE-2008-5079: net/atm/svc.c in the ATM subsystem allowed local users
to cause a denial of service (kernel infinite loop) by making two calls
to svc\_listen for the same socket, and then reading a /proc/net/atm/\*vc
file, related to corruption of the vcc table.
CVE-2008-5029: The \_\_scm\_destroy function in net/core/scm.c makes
indirect recursive calls to itself through calls to the fput function,
which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via
vectors related to sending an SCM\_RIGHTS message through a UNIX domain
socket and closing file descriptors.
CVE-2008-5134: Buffer overflow in the lbs\_process\_bss function
in drivers/net/wireless/libertas/scan.c in the libertas subsystem
allowed remote attackers to have an unknown impact via an "invalid
beacon/probe response."
CVE-2008-4933: Buffer overflow in the hfsplus\_find\_cat function in
fs/hfsplus/catalog.c allowed attackers to cause a denial of service
(memory corruption or system crash) via an hfsplus filesystem
image with an invalid catalog namelength field, related to the
hfsplus\_cat\_build\_key\_uni function.
CVE-2008-5025: Stack-based buffer overflow in the hfs\_cat\_find\_brec
function in fs/hfs/catalog.c allowed attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption or system crash) via an hfs filesystem
image with an invalid catalog namelength field, a related issue to
CVE-2008-4933.
CVE-2008-5182: The inotify functionality might allow local users to
gain privileges via unknown vectors related to race conditions in
inotify watch removal and umount.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 Service Pack 2 kernel was updated to
version 2.6.16.60-0.34 to fix some security issues and various bugs.
The following security problems have been fixed:
CVE-2008-5079: net/atm/svc.c in the ATM subsystem allowed local users
to cause a denial of service (kernel infinite loop) by making two calls
to svc\_listen for the same socket, and then reading a /proc/net/atm/
\*vc file, related to corruption of the vcc table.
CVE-2008-5029: The \_\_scm\_destroy function in net/core/scm.c makes
indirect recursive calls to itself through calls to the fput function,
which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via
vectors related to sending an SCM\_RIGHTS message through a UNIX domain
socket and closing file descriptors.
CVE-2008-4933: Buffer overflow in the hfsplus\_find\_cat function in
fs/hfsplus/catalog.c allowed attackers to cause a denial of service
(memory corruption or system crash) via an hfsplus filesystem
image with an invalid catalog namelength field, related to the
hfsplus\_cat\_build\_key\_uni function.
CVE-2008-5025: Stack-based buffer overflow in the hfs\_cat\_find\_brec
function in fs/hfs/catalog.c allowed attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption or system crash) via an hfs filesystem
image with an invalid catalog namelength field, a related issue to
CVE-2008-4933.
CVE-2008-5182: The inotify functionality might allow local users to
gain privileges via unknown vectors related to race conditions in
inotify watch removal and umount.
A lot of other bugs were fixed, a detailed list can be found in the
RPM changelog.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : linux-2.6.24
Vulnerability  : denial of service/privilege escalation
Problem type   : local/remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-3528 CVE-2008-4554 CVE-2008-4576 CVE-2008-4618
                 CVE-2008-4933 CVE-2008-4934 CVE-2008-5025 CVE-2008-5029
                 CVE-2008-5134 CVE-2008-5182 CVE-2008-5300

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2008-3528

    Eugene Teo reported a local DoS issue in the ext2 and ext3
    filesystems.  Local users who have been granted the privileges
    necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted
    filesystem that causes the kernel to output error messages in an
    infinite loop.

CVE-2008-4554

    Milos Szeredi reported that the usage of splice() on files opened
    with O_APPEND allows users to write to the file at arbitrary
    offsets, enabling a bypass of possible assumed semantics of the
    O_APPEND flag.

CVE-2008-4576

    Vlad Yasevich reported an issue in the SCTP subsystem that may
    allow remote users to cause a local DoS by triggering a kernel
    oops.

CVE-2008-4618

    Wei Yongjun reported an issue in the SCTP subsystem that may allow
    remote users to cause a local DoS by triggering a kernel panic.

CVE-2008-4933

    Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfsplus
    filesystem.  Local users who have been granted the privileges
    necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted
    filesystem that causes the kernel to overrun a buffer, resulting
    in a system oops or memory corruption.

CVE-2008-4934

    Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfsplus
    filesystem.  Local users who have been granted the privileges
    necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted
    filesystem that results in a kernel oops due to an unchecked
    return value.

CVE-2008-5025

    Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfs filesystem.
    Local users who have been granted the privileges necessary to
    mount a filesystem would be able to craft a filesystem with a
    corrupted catalog name length, resulting in a system oops or
    memory corruption.

CVE-2008-5029

    Andrea Bittau reported a DoS issue in the unix socket subsystem
    that allows a local user to cause memory corruption, resulting in
    a kernel panic.

CVE-2008-5134

    Johannes Berg reported a remote DoS issue in the libertas wireless
    driver, which can be triggered by a specially crafted beacon/probe
    response.

CVE-2008-5182

    Al Viro reported race conditions in the inotify subsystem that may
    allow local users to acquire elevated privileges.

CVE-2008-5300

    Dann Frazier reported a DoS condition that allows local users to
    cause the out of memory handler to kill off privileged processes
    or trigger soft lockups due to a starvation issue in the unix
    socket subsystem.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.24-6~etchnhalf.7.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6.24 packages.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) -

## Details

Hugo Dias discovered that the ATM subsystem did not correctly manage

socket counts. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a system hang,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5079](/security/CVE-2008-5079))

It was discovered that the inotify subsystem contained watch removal

race conditions. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5182](/security/CVE-2008-5182))

Dann Frazier discovered that in certain situations sendmsg did not

correctly release allocated memory. A local attacker could exploit

this to force the system to run out of free memory, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2008-5300](/security/CVE-2008-5300))

Helge Deller discovered that PA-RISC stack unwinding was not handled

correctly. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system,

leading do a denial of service. This did not affect official Ubuntu

kernels, but was fixed in the source for anyone performing HPPA kernel

builds. ([CVE-2008-5395](/security/CVE-2008-5395))

It was discovered that the ATA subsystem did not correctly set timeouts. A

local attacker could exploit this to cause a system hang, leading to a

denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5700](/security/CVE-2008-5700))

It was discovered that the ib700 watchdog timer did not correctly check

buffer sizes. A local attacker could send a specially crafted ioctl

to the device to cause a system crash, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2008-5702](/security/CVE-2008-5702))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [linux-image-2.6.27-11-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [2.6.27-11.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/2.6.27-11.27)
* [linux-image-2.6.27-11-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [2.6.27-11.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/2.6.27-11.27)
* [linux-image-2.6.27-11-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [2.6.27-11.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/2.6.27-11.27)

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
