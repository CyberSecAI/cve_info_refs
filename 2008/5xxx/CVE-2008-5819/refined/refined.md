Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5819:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in the eDNews v2 application.
- The `eDNews_archive.php` script includes language files based on a user-controlled parameter, `$CONFIG['language']`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application uses the `$_REQUEST['lg']` parameter to determine the language file to include. The application does not properly sanitize this input, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files.
- Unsanitized input: The application takes user-supplied input directly from the `lg` GET parameter and uses this to determine a file path to include.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem by manipulating the `lg` parameter, potentially exposing sensitive information, configuration files, or even source code.
- **Partial Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** As noted on securityreason.com, the vulnerability has a partial impact on all three.
   - Confidentiality: Sensitive information can be exposed.
   - Integrity: An attacker can potentially read files to extract other credentials or data that would be used in an attack.
   - Availability: This vulnerability by itself does not directly impact availability, though the extracted information could be used in a later attack to negatively impact availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL using the `lg` parameter in the GET request to `eDNews_archive.php`.
- **Path Traversal:** The attacker leverages path traversal techniques (e.g., `../../../../`) to navigate to arbitrary file paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable eDNews application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to send HTTP GET requests and manipulate URL parameters.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any form of user authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability resides in the `eDNews_archive.php` file:
    ```php
    require_once dirname( __FILE__ ).'/myConfig.php';
    require_once dirname( __FILE__ ).'/languages/'.$CONFIG['language'].'.php';
    ```
- The `myConfig.php` file sets the language parameter:
    ```php
    if ( isset( $_REQUEST['lg'] ) ) {
        $CONFIG['language'] = $_REQUEST['lg'];
    }
    ```
- An example exploit URL: `/eDNews_archive.php?lg=../../../../index`

**Additional Notes**
- The exploit-db entry provides a POC (Proof of Concept) and lists the vulnerable file.
- The securityreason.com entry lists the CVSS score and impact subscores.
- The vulnerability was reported on milw0rm.com and Secunia (though the Secunia link is not directly present in the given text, it is mentioned).
- The vulnerability is tagged with CWE-22, which stands for Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory.
