 * hoagie_solaris_siocgtunparam.c
 * LOCAL SOLARIS KERNEL ROOT EXPLOIT (< 5.10 138888-01) - CVE-2008-568
 *
 * Bug reported by Tobias Klein
 * http://www.trapkit.de/advisories/TKADV2008-015.txt
 * Exploit by: peri.carding (http://www.void.at/main/)
 *
 * $ ./hoagie_solaris_siocgtunparam
 * hoagie_solaris_siocgtunparam.c - solaris root < < 5.10 138888-01 local
 * -andi / void.at
 *
 * [*] socket created
 * [*] mapping zero page successful
 * [*] process cred address: 0xd3853894
 * [*] prepare null page
 * [*] clean up write queue
 * # uname -a
 * SunOS unknown 5.10 Generic_118844-26 i86pc i386 i86pc
 * # id
 * uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
 * #
 *
 * First of all we have to make sure that ip_extract_tunreq() will
 * return 0 and ipifp is still set to NULL. This can be achieved by
 * using an interface alias starting with zero. (the interface ip.tun0
 * must not exist because ipif_lookup_on_name() will "fail" to get
 * null page)
 *
 * ip_if.c / ipif_lookup_on_name()
 * ...
 *    if (&cp[2] < endp && cp[1] == '0')
 *       return (NULL);
 * ...
 *
 * In ip_sioctl_tunparam() ipif->ipif_ill is used for mutex enter
 * so we have to set the offet for an ill_t structure. Later putnext()
 * will be called with a queue (see ill_t). We can use this queue to
 * add a custom callback function that is used by putnext().
 *
 * ip_if.c / ip_sioctl_tunparam():
 * ...
 *      ill = ipif->ipif_ill;
 *      mutex_enter(&connp->conn_lock);
 *      mutex_enter(&ill->ill_lock);
 * ...
 *      if (success) {
 *         ip1dbg(("sending down tunparam request "));
 *         putnext(ill->ill_wq, mp1);
 *         return (EINPROGRESS);
 * ...
 *
 * putnext.c / putnext():
 * ...
 *      mutex_exit(QLOCK(qp));
 *      STR_FTEVENT_MSG(mp, fqp, FTEV_PUTNEXT, mp->b_rptr -
 *         mp->b_datap->db_base);
 *      (*putproc)(qp, mp);
 * ...
 *
 * ill_wq can't be modified from kernel space because its allocated
 * in userland -> so we cannot modify the ill_wq queue in kernel
 * code. thereforce a signal handler will clean the queue in userland.
 *
 * Affected Software:      Solaris 10 without patch 138888-01 (SPARC)
 *                         Solaris 10 without patch 138889-01 (x86)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Advisory: Sun Solaris SIOCGTUNPARAM IOCTL Kernel NULL pointer
dereference
Advisory ID: TKADV2008-015
Revision: 1.1
Release Date: 2008/12/17
Last Modified: 2009/02/15
Date Reported: 2007/09/04
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: Solaris 10 without patch 138888-01 (SPARC)
Solaris 10 without patch 138889-01 (x86)
OpenSolaris < snv\_77 (SPARC)
OpenSolaris < snv\_77 (x86)
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
Vendor URL: http://www.sun.com
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
CVE-ID: CVE-2008-568
Patch development time: 471 days
======================
Vulnerability Details:
======================
The kernel of Solaris contains a vulnerability in the code that handles
SIOCGTUNPARAM IOCTL requests. Exploitation of this vulnerability can
result in:
1) local denial of service attacks (system crash due to a kernel panic), or
[ As all Solaris Zones (Containers) share the same kernel it is possible
to crash the whole system (all Zones) even if the vulnerability is
triggered in an unprivileged non-global zone. ]
2) local execution of arbitrary code at the kernel level (complete system
compromise) on x86 platforms
[ As all Solaris Zones (Containers) share the same kernel it is possible
to escape from unprivileged non-global zones and compromise other non-
global zones or the global zone. ]
The issue can be triggered by sending a specially crafted IOCTL request to
the kernel.
==================
Technical Details:
==================
The following source code references are based on the kernel source code
available from http://www.opensolaris.org.
http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/uts/common/
inet/ip/ip.c:
[...]
26692 void
26693 ip\_process\_ioctl(ipsq\_t \*ipsq, queue\_t \*q, mblk\_t \*mp, void \*arg)
26694 {
[...]
26717 [1] ci.ci\_ipif = NULL
[...]
26735 case TUN\_CMD:
[...]
26740 [2] err = ip\_extract\_tunreq(q, mp, &ci.ci\_ipif, ip\_process\_ioctl);
26741 if (err != 0) {
26742 ip\_ioctl\_finish(q, mp, err, IPI2MODE(ipip), NULL);
26743 return;
26744 }
[...]
26782 if (!(ipip->ipi\_flags & IPI\_WR)) {
[...]
26788 [3] err = (\*ipip->ipi\_func)(ci.ci\_ipif, ci.ci\_sin, q, mp, ipip,
26789 ci.ci\_lifr);
[...]
[1] The value of "ci.ci\_ipif" is set to "NULL".
[2] When a SIOCGTUNPARAM IOCTL is called the switch case "TUN\_CMD" is
chosen and the "ip\_extract\_tunreq()" function gets called.
[3] If the return value of the "ip\_extract\_tunreq()" function is 0 the
"ci.ci\_ipif" variable is later on used as the first parameter for the
"ip\_sioctl\_tunparam()" function.
http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/uts/common/
inet/ip/ip\_if.c:
[...]
9468 int
9469 ip\_sioctl\_tunparam(ipif\_t \*ipif, sin\_t \*dummy\_sin, queue\_t \*q, mblk\_t
\*mp,
9470 ip\_ioctl\_cmd\_t \*ipip, void \*dummy\_ifreq)
9471 {
...
9499 [4] ill = ipif->ipif\_ill;
[...]
In the "ip\_sioctl\_tunparam()" function the first parameter "ipif" is used
to reference some data (see [4]).
It is possible to return from the "ip\_extract\_tunreq()" function (see [2])
with a return value of 0 while "ci.ci\_ipif" is also still set to NULL. As
"ipif" has the same value as "ci.ci\_ipif", which is set to NULL, this leads
to a NULL pointer dereference (see [4]).
On x86 (32/64bit) platforms this Null pointer dereference can be exploited
to execute arbitrary code at the kernel level. On SPARC platforms the
vulnerability can "only" be used for a denial of service.
=========
Solution:
=========
This issue is addressed in the following patch releases from Sun:
SPARC Platform
- Solaris 10 with patch 138888-01 or later
- OpenSolaris based upon builds snv\_77 or later

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
