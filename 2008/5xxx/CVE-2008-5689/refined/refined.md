  "CVE-2008-5689": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the Solaris kernel when handling SIOCGTUNPARAM IOCTL requests.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `ip_extract_tunreq()` function can return 0 while `ci.ci_ipif` remains NULL.",
        "The `ip_sioctl_tunparam()` function dereferences `ipif->ipif_ill` where `ipif` can be NULL, leading to a null pointer dereference."
      ],
      "impact": "On x86 platforms, successful exploitation leads to local privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution at the kernel level. On SPARC platforms, it can cause a denial of service (system crash/kernel panic). The vulnerability can be triggered from within unprivileged Solaris zones, allowing for container escape and compromise of other zones or the global zone.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted SIOCGTUNPARAM IOCTL request to the kernel. Specifically, creating an interface alias starting with zero to make ip_extract_tunreq() return 0 while ci.ci_ipif is still NULL",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have local access to the system and the ability to send IOCTL requests."
    },
      "affected_software": [
        "Solaris 10 without patch 138888-01 (SPARC)",
        "Solaris 10 without patch 138889-01 (x86)",
        "OpenSolaris < snv_77 (SPARC)",
        "OpenSolaris < snv_77 (x86)"
    ],
     "patches": [
        "Solaris 10 with patch 138888-01 or later (SPARC)",
        "Solaris 10 with patch 138889-01 or later (x86)",
        "OpenSolaris based upon builds snv_77 or later"
      ],
    "additional_notes": "The exploit code provided sets up a custom callback function by mapping a null page, which is later called via `putnext()` to overwrite the process credentials to gain root privileges. A signal handler is used to clean up the write queue."
