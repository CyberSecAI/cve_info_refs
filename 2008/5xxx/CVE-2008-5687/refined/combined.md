-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

This is a security release of MediaWiki 1.13.3, 1.12.1 and 1.6.11.
Some of the security issues affect *all* versions of MediaWiki except
the versions released today, so all site administrators are encouraged
to upgrade.

Users of the development (trunk) branch should upgrade to r44506 or later.

David Remahl of Apple's Product Security team has identified a number
of security issues in MediaWiki. Subsequent analysis by the MediaWiki
development team led to further discoveries. The issues with a
significant impact are as follows:

* An XSS vulnerability affecting all MediaWiki installations between
1.13.0 and 1.13.2. [CVE-2008-5249]
* A local script injection vulnerability affecting Internet Explorer
clients for all MediaWiki installations with uploads enabled.
[CVE-2008-5250]
* A local script injection vulnerability affecting clients with SVG
scripting capability (such as Firefox 1.5+), for all MediaWiki
installations with SVG uploads enabled. [CVE-2008-5250]
* A CSRF vulnerability affecting the Special:Import feature, for all
MediaWiki installations since the feature was introduced in 1.3.0.
[CVE-2008-5252]

These four vulnerabilities are all fixed in these releases.

XSS (cross-site scripting) vulnerabilities allow an attacker to steal
an authorised user's login session, and to act as that user on the
wiki. The authorised user must visit a web page controlled by the
attacker in order to activate the attack. Intranet wikis are
vulnerable if the attacker can determine the intranet URL.

Local script injection vulnerabilities are like XSS vulnerabilities,
except that the attacker must have an account on the local wiki, and
there is no external site involved. The attacker uploads a script to
the wiki, which another user is tricked into executing, with the
effect that the attacker is able to act as the privileged user.

CSRF vulnerabilities allow an attacker to act as an authorised user on
the wiki, but unlike an XSS vulnerability, the attacker can only act
as the user in a specific and restricted way. The present CSRF
vulnerability allows pages to be edited, with forged revision
histories. Like an XSS vulnerability, the authorised user must visit
the malicious web page to activate the attack.

David Remahl also reminded us of some security-related configuration
issues:

* Since 1.11, by default, MediaWiki stores a backup of deleted images
in the images/deleted
  directory. If you do not want these images to be publically
accessible, make
  sure this directory is not accessible from the web. MediaWiki takes
some steps
  to avoid leaking these images, but these measures are not perfect.
* Set display_errors=off in your php.ini to avoid path disclosure via
PHP fatal
  errors. This is the default on most shared web hosts.
* Enabling MediaWiki's debugging features, such as
$wgShowExceptionDetails, may
  lead to path disclosure.

Users of MediaWiki 1.6.x (the last branch which supported PHP 4) are
strongly recommended to upgrade to PHP 5 and MediaWiki 1.13.3. It is
not necessary to upgrade to 1.6.11 first, just upgrade directly to the
latest version.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
