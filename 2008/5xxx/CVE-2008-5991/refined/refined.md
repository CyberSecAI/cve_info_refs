{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly includes files based on user input without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI). The `docs.php` script includes a file specified by the `doc` GET parameter without proper validation. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially gaining access to configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL containing the `doc` parameter and path traversal sequences such as `../../..`, an attacker can read arbitrary files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges are required."
