| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=477227#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-12-19 18:41:51 UTC  ``` Ludwig Nussel reported a flaw in libc-client / uw-imap:  The rfc822_output_char() function in the uw-imap c-client library does not check whether the buffer is already full and may therefore write one byte too much. This leads to a segfault in rfc822_output_data() later due to memcpy with size -1.  Issue was fixed in imap-2007e:   Updated: 16 December 2008    imap-2007e is a maintenance release, consisting primarily of bugfixes to   problems discovered in the release that affected a small number of users   plus a security fix for users of the RFC822BUFFER routines.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=477227#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-12-19 18:43:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 327481](attachment.cgi?id=327481&action=diff "Upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=327481&action=edit "Upstream patch") Upstream patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=477227#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2008-12-19 18:46:32 UTC  ``` imap/libc-client source code is also embedded in alpine sources.  This issue was already fixed in alpine SVN:   <https://svn.cac.washington.edu/public/alpine/snapshots/>  However, it's not clear whether this flaw is really triggerable in alpine.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=477227#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2008-12-19 18:48:19 UTC  ``` This issue did not affect versions of imap as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3, and libc-client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, as they do not include affected functions.  They seem to have been introduced in imap-2005.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=477227#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2008-12-19 18:50:56 UTC  ``` Additionally, according to upstream, this flaw most likely does not affect impad, but may affect other applications using c-client, such as PHP.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=477227#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-07 16:04:43 UTC  ``` Rex, I see new 2007e uw-imap in Koji and no update request.  Any known issues with new 2007e?  Can they be submitted as updates?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=477227#c8)  Rex Dieter    2009-01-07 16:08:37 UTC  ``` updates need to happen yes.  I just didn't personally have time... and asked my fedora comaintainers to issue an update (I suppose everyone is busy).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=477227#c9)  Fedora Update System    2009-01-12 11:06:28 UTC  ``` uw-imap-2007e-1.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/uw-imap-2007e-1.fc10>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=477227#c10)  Fedora Update System    2009-01-12 11:06:33 UTC  ``` uw-imap-2007e-1.fc9 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 9. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/uw-imap-2007e-1.fc9>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=477227#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-12 11:07:42 UTC  ``` Testing update requests submitted.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=477227#c12)  Fedora Update System    2009-01-21 21:36:57 UTC  ``` uw-imap-2007e-1.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.
