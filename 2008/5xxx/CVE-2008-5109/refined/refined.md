- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The advisory indicates the need for updated RTMP security measures in Flash Media Server. It implies that the previous versions had weaknesses in their content protection mechanisms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of sufficient RTMP security measures for streaming media delivery in Flash Media Server 3.0 and 3.5, which is addressed by new measures such as RTMPE or RTMPTE combined with SWF Verification.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The advisory discusses content protection, which suggests that without the update, an attacker could potentially bypass content protection measures and access or manipulate media streams without authorization.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is related to streaming media delivery over RTMP. Attackers could potentially exploit the lack of proper protection on the server side to access or manipulate media streams.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept or interact with the media stream, and have the technical knowledge to exploit the weaknesses in the older versions of Flash Media Server. The attacker might require knowledge of the RTMP protocol and its vulnerabilities.
