Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5789:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** vulnerability in the Joomla! Component Feederator version 1.0.5. The component's PHP files improperly handle the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter when including other files using `require_once`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes files based on a user-supplied parameter (`mosConfig_absolute_path`), which can be manipulated to include remote files from attacker-controlled servers.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The application fails to validate the user-supplied path, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable Joomla! application. This can lead to complete server compromise, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** Attackers can inject malicious URLs through the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter in GET requests to the vulnerable PHP files.
    *   Specifically, the vulnerable files are:
        *   `administrator/components/com_feederator/includes/tmsp/add_tmsp.php`
        *   `administrator/components/com_feederator/includes/tmsp/edit_tmsp.php`
        *   `administrator/components/com_feederator/includes/tmsp/subscription.php`
        *   `administrator/components/com_feederator/includes/tmsp/tmsp.php`
    *   The exploit URLs are of the format:
        *   `http://localhost/[path]/administrator/components/com_feederator/includes/tmsp/add_tmsp.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=[evilcode]`
        *   `http://localhost/[path]/administrator/components/com_feederator/includes/tmsp/edit_tmsp.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=[evilcode]`
        *    `http://localhost/[path]/administrator/components/com_feederator/includes/tmsp/subscription.php?GLOBALS[mosConfig_absolute_path]=[evilcode]`
        *   `http://localhost/[path]/administrator/components/com_feederator/includes/tmsp/tmsp.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=[evilcode]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Joomla! application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable component and the parameter to exploit.
*   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs a server to host the malicious PHP file to be included.
