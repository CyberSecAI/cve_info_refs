# USN-701-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

6 January 2009

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. If a user had Javascript

enabled, these problems could allow an attacker to crash Thunderbird and

possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-5500](/security/CVE-2008-5500))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that the same-origin check in Thunderbird could be

bypassed by utilizing XBL-bindings. If a user had Javascript enabled, an

attacker could exploit this to read data from other domains. ([CVE-2008-5503](/security/CVE-2008-5503))

Marius Schilder discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle redirects

to an outside domain when an XMLHttpRequest was made to a same-origin resource.

When Javascript is enabled, it's possible that sensitive information could be

revealed in the XMLHttpRequest response. ([CVE-2008-5506](/security/CVE-2008-5506))

Chris Evans discovered that Thunderbird did not properly protect a user's data

when accessing a same-domain Javascript URL that is redirected to an unparsable

Javascript off-site resource. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious

website and had Javascript enabled, an attacker may be able to steal a limited

amount of private data. ([CVE-2008-5507](/security/CVE-2008-5507))

Chip Salzenberg, Justin Schuh, Tom Cross, and Peter William discovered

Thunderbird did not properly parse URLs when processing certain control

characters. ([CVE-2008-5508](/security/CVE-2008-5508))

Kojima Hajime discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle an escaped

null character. An attacker may be able to exploit this flaw to bypass script

sanitization. ([CVE-2008-5510](/security/CVE-2008-5510))

Several flaws were discovered in the Javascript engine. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had Javascript enabled, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary Javascript code within the context of another

website or with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5511](/security/CVE-2008-5511), [CVE-2008-5512](/security/CVE-2008-5512))

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2008-61

## Information stealing via loadBindingDocument

Announced
December 16, 2008
Reporter
Boris Zbarsky
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.19
* SeaMonkey 1.1.14
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.19

### Description

Mozilla developer **Boris Zbarsky** reported that XBL
bindings could be used to read data from other domains, a violation
of the same-origin policy. The severity of this issue was determined
to be moderate due to several mitigating factors:

1. The target document requires a `<bindings>`
   element in the XBL namespace in order to be read.
2. The reader of the data needs to know the `id` attribute
   of the binding being read in advance.
3. It is unlikely that web services will expose private data in the
   manner described above.

Firefox 3 is not affected by this issue.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.

### Workaround

Products built from the Mozilla 1.9.0 branch and later, Firefox 3
for example, are not affected by this issue. Upgrading to one of
these products is a reliable workaround for this particular issue and
it is also Mozilla's recommendation that the most current version of
any Mozilla product be used. Alternatively, you can disable
JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

# USN-701-2: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

6 January 2009

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [mozilla-thunderbird](/security/cves?package=mozilla-thunderbird) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. If a user had Javascript

enabled, these problems could allow an attacker to crash Thunderbird and

possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-5500](/security/CVE-2008-5500))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that the same-origin check in Thunderbird could be

bypassed by utilizing XBL-bindings. If a user had Javascript enabled, an

attacker could exploit this to read data from other domains. ([CVE-2008-5503](/security/CVE-2008-5503))

Marius Schilder discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle redirects

to an outside domain when an XMLHttpRequest was made to a same-origin resource.

When Javascript is enabled, it's possible that sensitive information could be

revealed in the XMLHttpRequest response. ([CVE-2008-5506](/security/CVE-2008-5506))

Chris Evans discovered that Thunderbird did not properly protect a user's data

when accessing a same-domain Javascript URL that is redirected to an unparsable

Javascript off-site resource. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious

website and had Javascript enabled, an attacker may be able to steal a limited

amount of private data. ([CVE-2008-5507](/security/CVE-2008-5507))

Chip Salzenberg, Justin Schuh, Tom Cross, and Peter William discovered

Thunderbird did not properly parse URLs when processing certain control

characters. ([CVE-2008-5508](/security/CVE-2008-5508))

Several flaws were discovered in the Javascript engine. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had Javascript enabled, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary Javascript code within the context of another

website or with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5511](/security/CVE-2008-5511), [CVE-2008-5512](/security/CVE-2008-5512))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [mozilla-thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mozilla-thunderbird)
  -
  [1.5.0.13+1.5.0.15~prepatch080614i-0ubuntu0.6.06.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mozilla-thunderbird/1.5.0.13%2B1.5.0.15~prepatch080614i-0ubuntu0.6.06.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Thunderbird to effect

the necessary changes.

In fact, the only check it does is that the scheme of the document loadBindingDocument is called on matches the scheme of the document it's going to hand back. If they don't match, it hands back null.
Consequences:
1) Web sites can use this method to load data from file:// (though they can't read it). This includes things like /dev/stdin, etc...
2) Web sites can use this to load XBL from other sites and get access to the full DOM of the binding document. The XML \_does\_ need to contain a <bindings> tag in the XBL namespace, so it's not quite as bad as allowing arbitrary XML fetches, but still pretty bad.
Ideally we would do the following checks here:
A) CheckLoadURI.
B) Content policy check.
C) Same-origin check against URI to load.
D) Same-origin check on redirects.
Basically, whatever XMLHttpRequest does...
I really wish we didn't hand back the document here. I can't really see a use case for it, and we wouldn't need checks C and D above, probably, if all we did was to load the document somewhere internally. Maybe that's the way to go?

Also... we always load chrome bindings synchronously anyway. So I think all existing consumers of this in the tree are pointless. But I guess non-chrome bindings exist and all.Flags: blocking1.9?Flags: blocking1.8.1.5?Flags: blocking1.8.0.13?

Same thing applies to AddBinding, it lets you add bindings from any URI, which you can then dig into using document.getAnonymousNodesFor(...)

Turns out that loadBindingDocument was the only thing that didn't have security checks at all. However the security checks on -moz-binding, .addBinding etc didn't check for cross-origin.
I bet this patch will break a few users of cross-site bindings, but I don't see that we can do much about that for now.

I don't think this patch is quite right... It works for cases when the binding being attacked hasn't been loaded as a binding before, but not for cases when a binding extends something it wants to attack that was used as a binding on some other site.
Maybe that's not an issue we want to worry about?
In any case, I'll try to merge [bug 204140](/show_bug.cgi?id=204140 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Allow user style sheets to load XBL from file: URLs") to this patch somehow, I guess. :(

Also, doesn't this pass a null URI to content policy if aLoadingPrincipal happens to be system? I'm not sure that's desirable.

This made the testcase from [bug 71191](/show_bug.cgi?id=71191 "RESOLVED FIXED - can't have binding on outermost (root) element in xml document") fail, becuase it uses cross-domain (more or less) xbl: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=156917>
I guess that's intended?
I always thought the content part from other domains was allowed, but not the javascript part.

[Patch to fix](attachment.cgi?id=316909&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=316909&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=379959&attachment=316909)

This should fix things codewise, however I still need to do some testing magic before landing.
So it looks like we were in a much better shape than I had thought, which makes me much less worried about this causing breakage or regressions.
The original patch already addressed most of the critical concerns in comments 9 to 11. We do already block inheriting cross site as even inherited bindings are loaded through LoadBindingDocumentInfo. [Comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=379959#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - loadBindingDocument doesn't do any security checks") was addressed architecturally a long time ago since we no longer pass URIs but rather principals to the contentpolicy code.
What this patch does:
1. Make us not load data-urls (unless the origin has chrome privileges) for
bindings, this makes it significantly harder to perform XSS attacks using
XBL since you have to not only upload a style-rule, but also an XBL binding
document that contains evil XBL code.
The patch does let you load data-urls if a pref is set, this is to allow for
easier testing. Jesse has requested this, and I plan on turning this pref on
for the mochitest profile so that we can still use dataurls in mochitests.
2. Make us not call nsContentUtils::CheckSecurityBeforeLoad twice when loading
a binding from a new document. This is done by
A) checking if the binding document is cached in the documents
bindingmanager before calling nsContentUtils::CheckSecurityBeforeLoad.
B) Making sure to cache the binding document in the bindingmanager always
when a binding document is used. This happened most of the time already,
the only instance where it doesn't is when the binding document already
exists in the XUL cache.
2B makes us use a little bit more memory. Probably insignificantly more, but I still made us only do it for non-chrome documents, and made nsContentUtils::CheckSecurityBeforeLoad really fast for chrome-documents.
What remains to be done:
\* Write a mochitest to make sure that the data-uri and cross-site uri blocking works as it should. (tested locally and it seems to).
\* Change the mochitest profile so that we still pass mochitest.
\* Change any reftests that use data-urls since we don't have a default profile for reftest yet

Same as the previous, but with tests as well as changes to mochitest profiles in order to let mochitests still use XBL with data-urls. The C++ changes are exactly the same as the previous patch.
I still need to change reftests and crashtests to not use data-urls since those don't run in custom profiles yet. See [bug 374458](/show_bug.cgi?id=374458 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make reftest and crashtest write its own preferences/profile"). However I'll create a separate patch for those as I want to back that out once [bug 374458](/show_bug.cgi?id=374458 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make reftest and crashtest write its own preferences/profile") is fixed.

So in the new setup, if a UA stylesheet attaches a binding to some node in a content document, then after that the content document can attach that binding to arbitrary nodes in the document, since we hit the hashtable before doing the security check. I'm not at all sure we want that to happen.
It looks like in the LoadBindings case we still do the security check at least twice, even with this patch.
If we do the security check before the hashtable access, maybe the "binding is loaded" code just needs to pass in a boolean to skip the security check in that one case?
Or maybe the binding manager hashtable should use a "uri and principal" key like the one at <<http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/layout/style/nsCSSLoader.h#222>> (just move that key out to nsContentUtils or whatever) so that we just don't get a match if the URI is the same but the loading principals are different? Doing that and putting the hashtable access before the security check would make me happy, I think...
I'd prefer using IsSystemPrincipal() in nsContentUtils to direct comparisons against sSystemPrincipal.

Yeah, I was aware that this would be the case, but I'm not sure how big of a deal that is. I guess the uri+principal idea might be a good one. Will look into it.

How so? I can't find any other than the one we do in LoadBindingDocumentInfo?

Actually this is already happening, the "binding is loaded" code passes nsnull as aOriginPrincipal so we'll just skip the security check assuming that security has already been checked.

Er... indeed. I think I got confused amongst the different blame versions I was looking at. :(

To make it clear, I meant using nsContentUtils::IsSystemPrincipal(). I'm fine with adding that fast-path.

So I opted not to use the uri+originprincipal key. Turned out I would have had to muck around with the code quite a bit to get the principal correct everywhere. And the only real advantage is that we would do fewer security checks when content is using XBL, something that is very rare. If we really want to optimize that we can do that later.
So this patch just gets rid of the sSystemPrincipal stuff, and moves the security checks to above the bindingmanager hashlookup. The bugzilla interdiff actually works this time!
Please ignore the nsElementMap changes, they are not supposed to be there.

For what it's worth, I was OK with keeping sSystemPrincipal, as I said in [comment 42](/show_bug.cgi?id=379959#c42 "RESOLVED FIXED - loadBindingDocument doesn't do any security checks"). I just think that we should only have a "== sSystemPrincipal" in nsContentUtils::IsSystemPrincipal and use that call in the various nsContentUtils comparisons.

So the only real changes here, as far as I can tell are the data: pref and the fast-path in CheckSecurityBeforeLoad, no? r+sr=bzbarsky on those, but the rest of the changes don't seem to be needed here and I'd rather we didn't make them just because. You're right that various other patches largely addressed the issues in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=379959#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - loadBindingDocument doesn't do any security checks") through [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=379959#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - loadBindingDocument doesn't do any security checks").

We need to change <http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Firefox_3_for_developers> to say that data: is only available for chrome code, e.i. extension developers.
We should also say that the normal same-origin policy is used for websites meaning that they can only link to XBL files on the same domain. XBL can also be loaded from chrome-urls. Ideal would be if we could link to the documentation for the new policy of linking to chrome-urls, which is the policy that is used here too.

I've definitely seen links to the following in various places, even from the security stuff in the Doctype thing Google's doing:
<http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/same-origin.html>

Sure, but that document doesn't actually describe the check that happens here, so much. In particular, it doesn't describe how one determines the origin the XBL request is coming from (which is somewhat important), nor does it describe the peculiarities with chrome:// XBL links, etc.

OK, where can I get specific details about how the same-origin policy works, so I can make sure we have a thorough document on it? Alternately, if someone else that actually knows how it works would like to throw something together, I can copy-edit it once you're done.

Let me see if I can summarize. sicking, please correct me if I get something wrong.
Whether XBL is allowed to be loaded depends on the nsIPrincipal originating the load and the nsIURI to be loaded. The principal originating the load is determined as follows:
1) External stylesheets (<link>, <?xml-stylesheet?>, user sheets, UA sheets):
Depends on where the sheet is loaded from, just like it would for an HTML
document loaded from such a source.
2) Inline stylesheets (<style>, style attributes): The principal of the Element
node involved (the <style> element or the element whose style attribute
we're looking at).
3) nsIDOMDocumentXBL.addBinding/loadBindingDocument: The principal of the
script making the call, or the principal of the document the call is made
on if there is no such script.
The following checks are performed:
a) If the principal originating the load is the system principal, the load is
allowed.
b) A CheckLoadURIWithPrincipal check to make sure the given principal can link
to the given URI to start with.
c) A content policy check.
d) If the XBL-from-data: pref is set and the URI is a data: URI the load is
allowed.
e) If the URI is a chrome: URI the load is allowed. Note that step (b) already
bailed out for cases when it's a chrome: URI that is not accessible to
untrusted content.
f) Finally, a CheckMayLoad check is performed on the originating principal and
the given URI. If the originating principal is a NullPrincipal, this
returns false. Otherwise, if the principal's codebase URI and the target
URI are same-origin per the link in [comment 58](/show_bug.cgi?id=379959#c58 "RESOLVED FIXED - loadBindingDocument doesn't do any security checks"), it returns true. Otherwise,
it has some fairly complicated special-casing for our fairly complicated
same-origin policy for file:// URIs... Basically, the load is allowed if
both the origin and target are file:// URIs, the target is not a directory,
and is either a in a subdirectory of the origin (when the origin is a
directory, which is pretty much never for XBL) or is in a subdirectory of
the origin's parent (when the origin is a file).
It might be worth documenting CheckMayLoad separately (since it's used for other things, like XMLHttpRequest), and referring to that documentation from the XBL doc.

Does this policy work the same way as for JavaScript content, or does XBL have a different policy?

|  | |

Which "this policy"? The overall process is very different from, say, a check whether some JS is allowed to access some Node, starting with the fact that the "can JS access this node" check is something that takes two principals, not a principal and a URI.

I've seen the phrase "same origin policy" applied both to XBL and JavaScript. I'd like to know if the policy is the same for both.

Ah. No, it is not. The definition of "same origin" for two URIs is the same, but XBL and JavaScript use different methods of determining the relevant URIs to test, and both XBL and JavaScript have some exceptions that make the policies not quite pure "same origin" policies.

|  | |

I'm not sure it's written up anywhere, other than perhaps the HTML5 specification in broad strokes. The issues with the JS policy are when the check is done (the simple answer is "on any property access", maybe) and what it checks (that the two principals are "equal" in the sense that the origin URI (codebase unless .domain was set, adjusted for the domain set otherwise) is same-origin for the two, and either both have set .domain or neither has set .domain.
But there are all kinds of exceptions to the above depending on exact situation...

This should work on the 1.8 branch. I opted to keep the checks in LoadBindings rather than (the more efficient) way we do it on trunk where they live in LoadBindingDocumentInfo. This should be safe as I also make .loadBindingDocument always return null, so even if you can get arbitrary binding documents into the bindingmanager, you can't attach them anywhere.

The best way to test on 1.8 would be to try ensure that you can't load XBL cross site by using loadBindingDocument. I don't think we have any non-mochitest testcases.

This bug caused a regression on the 1.9 trunk ([bug 387971](/show_bug.cgi?id=387971 "VERIFIED WORKSFORME - Password field on http://www.wellsfargo.com does not render")) which was then fixed there by a fix to another bug ([bug 204140](/show_bug.cgi?id=204140 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Allow user style sheets to load XBL from file: URLs")). Sadly, however, since that regression was not marked here, we didn't realize that when taking this on 1.8.1 for Firefox 2.0.0.19, resulting in a regression there as well ([bug 470049](/show_bug.cgi?id=470049 "RESOLVED FIXED - wellsfargo.com - password field does not display in 1.8.1.x browsers")).
Whew! Anyway, the point is:
- the fix for this bug causes a regression that results in wellsfargo not working properly (as it restricts the ability to see the styling for the password field, and thus the password field). That's [bug 387971](/show_bug.cgi?id=387971 "VERIFIED WORKSFORME - Password field on http://www.wellsfargo.com does not render") for 1.9 and [bug 470049](/show_bug.cgi?id=470049 "RESOLVED FIXED - wellsfargo.com - password field does not display in 1.8.1.x browsers") for the 1.8.1 branch.
- that regression was fixed on 1.9 in [bug 204140](/show_bug.cgi?id=204140 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Allow user style sheets to load XBL from file: URLs")
- we now need to fix that regression on the 1.8.1 branch

Fixing that regression involves fixing numerous ([bug 204140](/show_bug.cgi?id=204140 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Allow user style sheets to load XBL from file: URLs") has a bunch of dependencies). It might take a day to get all that code ported and reviewed, to say nothing of the risk involved with taking that much code at the very last minute. I'm not sure what we should be doing here.

asac: I don't think you want this patch for 1.8.0 given it breaks loging into wellsfargo.com. You'll need a new patch with regressions fixed.

The alternative is rolling out a simpler, but different, fix for 1.8. If we
simply ignored any XBL that failed to load then I think we'd be golden. What
happens currently is that if we fail to load an XBL we refuse to render
anything, even the normal content.

Sooo... apologies for ressuscitating an old bug, but I'm poking about because of [bug 1049199](/show_bug.cgi?id=1049199 "RESOLVED FIXED - Style editor should show stylesheets associated with XBL bindings"), where the first step would be having a list of the XBL-included stylesheets.
I found the relevant DOMDocumentXBL interface with the void loadBindingDocument call, and a pointer to MDN.
Then I read:
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XBL/XBL_1.0_Reference/DOM_Interfaces#loadBindingDocument>
and I was very confused, because the method is clearly void and never returns anything. Are the docs just outdated? What is the use of calling it when it's void() ? (ie: can we just rip it out at this point?)Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

|  | |

The docs are outdated, yes.
The use of calling it is that it precaches the binding document in question, so that bindings from it can be applied synchronously. Not only that, but it will not return until the load is complete.
In other words, you can call this method, then start using bindings from that binding document and not end up having to wait for them to load async.
This is, of course, a pretty crappy thing to do in some ways... ;)
Now the thing is, we don't use this method in our codebase, and addons mxr only shows me uses for chrome:// and resource:// URIs, which get XBL sync-loaded anyway. So maybe we can in fact remove it...Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceweasel web
browser, an unbranded version of the Firefox browser. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

   Boris Zbarsky discovered that an information disclosure attack could
   be performed via XBL bindings. (MFSA 2008-61)

CVE-2008-5504

   It was discovered that attackers could run arbitrary JavaScript with
   chrome privileges via vectors related to the feed preview.
   (MFSA 2008-62)

CVE-2008-5506

   Marius Schilder discovered that it is possible to obtain sensible
   data via a XMLHttpRequest. (MFSA 2008-64)

CVE-2008-5507

   Chris Evans discovered that it is possible to obtain sensible data
   via a JavaScript URL. (MFSA 2008-65)

   Chip Salzenberg discovered possible phishing attacks via URLs with
   leading whitespaces or control characters. (MFSA 2008-66)

CVE-2008-5510

   Kojima Hajime and Jun Muto discovered that escaped null characters
   were ignored by the CSS parser and could lead to the bypass of
   protection mechanisms (MFSA 2008-67)

CVE-2008-5511

   It was discovered that it is possible to perform cross-site scripting
   attacks via an XBL binding to an "unloaded document." (MFSA 2008-68)

CVE-2008-5512

   It was discovered that it is possible to run arbitrary JavaScript
   with chrome privileges via unknown vectors. (MFSA 2008-68)

CVE-2008-5513

   moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that the session-restore feature does not
   properly sanitise input leading to arbitrary injections. This issue
   could be used to perform an XSS attack or run arbitrary JavaScript
   with chrome privileges. (MFSA 2008-69)

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.19-0etch1.

For the testing distribution (lenny) and the unstable distribution (sid)
these problems have been fixed in version 3.0.5-1. Please note iceweasel
