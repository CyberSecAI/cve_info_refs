{
  "CVE-2008-5503": {
    "Description": "Boris Zbarsky discovered that the same-origin check in Thunderbird/Firefox could be bypassed by utilizing XBL-bindings. If a user had Javascript enabled, an attacker could exploit this to read data from other domains.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper security checks in the `loadBindingDocument` function and other related areas when utilizing XBL bindings, allowing for a same-origin policy bypass.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper same-origin policy enforcement",
      "Inadequate security checks for XBL bindings",
       "Information disclosure through XBL bindings"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can read data from other domains, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure. This could allow for an information disclosure attack, where an attacker can bypass the same-origin policy by using XBL bindings to access data from different domains, which would typically be protected.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploiting XBL bindings",
      "Bypassing the same-origin check"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the victim to have Javascript enabled, and the attacker needs to be able to get the victim to load a crafted document or website, and the attacker needs to know the id of the binding in order to read data from it, also the target document needs a `<bindings>` element in the XBL namespace"
  }
