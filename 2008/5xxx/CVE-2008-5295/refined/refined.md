Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5295:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection in the `index.php` file of Jamit Job Board, specifically through the `show_emp` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user input provided through the `show_emp` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- The term "blind" indicates that the attacker may not see direct output of the query, but they can still infer results through the application's behavior, such as the time it takes to respond.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure/Confidentiality Impact:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Modification/Integrity Impact:** Although not explicitly mentioned as a primary impact in the provided text, SQL injection vulnerabilities often allow an attacker to modify or delete data.
- **Availability Impact:** An attacker might be able to perform a denial-of-service attack by manipulating the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via HTTP requests.
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `show_emp` parameter of the `index.php` file.
    - Example: `http://www.example.com/index.php?show_emp=[sql]`
    - Specific Example: `http://www.jamit.com/jobs/index.php?show_emp=1%20and%20substring(@@version,1,1)=4`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application to send malicious HTTP requests.
- **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and blind SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit examples demonstrate the use of `substring(@@version,1,1)` to determine database version. This is a common technique used in blind SQL injection scenarios.
- The content indicates that the vulnerability was found by "XaDoS".
