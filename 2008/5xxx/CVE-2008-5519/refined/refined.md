```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The mod_jk connector in Apache Tomcat did not properly handle cases where a client sets the Content-Length header without sending any data, or when a user submits multiple requests rapidly.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Information disclosure vulnerability, allowing one user to view the response intended for another user.

- Impact of exploitation: A malicious or faulty client could cause mod_jk to mismanage responses, potentially exposing sensitive information from one user's session to another.

- Attack vectors: By sending a request with a Content-Length header but no data, or by sending requests in rapid succession, an attacker can cause mod_jk to return responses intended for a different client.

- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server using a vulnerable mod_jk connector. No authentication or specific position on the network is required.
