Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5508:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from inconsistent handling of leading whitespace and control characters in URL parsing within Mozilla products (Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey). Specifically, the `nsBaseURLParser::ParseURL` function incorrectly skipped certain control characters at the beginning of a URL, leading to misinterpretation of the URL's scheme, host, and other components.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inconsistent Whitespace Handling:** The URL parsing code treated leading whitespace inconsistently, causing unexpected parsing behavior.
- **Control Character Handling:** The code incorrectly skipped over certain control characters at the beginning of URLs instead of treating them as invalid for scheme extraction. This allowed for the possibility of malformed URLs being processed.
- **Incorrect Offset Calculation:** When leading whitespace or control characters were skipped, the offsets for different URL segments were calculated incorrectly, leading to the misinterpretation of the URL's components in `BuildNormalizedSpec`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Incorrect URL Rendering:**  Malformed URLs were output, causing incorrect rendering of hyperlinks. 
- **Potential Phishing Attacks:**  Due to the incorrect parsing and malformed URLs, there was a risk of phishing attacks.  Users may be presented with deceptive URLs, leading them to believe they are visiting a legitimate website when in fact they are not. This is the most notable impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious HTML:** An attacker could embed specially crafted URLs containing leading whitespace or control characters within HTML.
- **User Interaction:** The user would need to interact with the link, for example by hovering over or copying the link location for the vulnerability to be exposed.
- **Direct call to nsIURLParser:** Addons using nsIURLParser directly may not pre-filter URIs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to create HTML documents**  The attacker needs to be able to create HTML content with crafted URLs.
- **No special user privileges required** The attacker does not need any special privileges or system access other than the ability to embed HTML.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was initially flagged as potentially leading to a buffer overflow due to the odd results, but it was determined that no buffer overflow occurred in the string manipulation functions.
- The fix involved ensuring that the `nsBaseURLParser::ParseURL` function strips only whitespace, not control characters from the start of the URL, and calculates offsets correctly.
- Patches were released for Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird.
- This vulnerability is closely related to [bug 451613](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=451613) which was the primary bug targeted for fixing the core parsing issue with offsets, with this bug [425046](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=425046)  being a specific example of the broader issue.
