Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2008-5772:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the ASPSiteWare RealtyListing application when processing user-supplied parameters in the `type.asp` and `detail.asp` scripts. Specifically, the `iType` and `iPro` parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input (`iType`, `iPro`) before using them in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This is a classic instance of CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection').

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to access sensitive information stored in the database, such as user credentials.
*   **Data Modification:** With sufficient privileges, an attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Full DB access**: Attackers can potentially gain complete control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is remote.
*   The attacker manipulates the `iType` and `iPro` parameters within the URL of the vulnerable `type.asp` and `detail.asp` pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious queries.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   The provided exploit examples utilize `UNION SELECT` statements to retrieve data from the `users` table. This confirms that the vulnerability allows arbitrary SQL queries.
*   The exploit examples use the numeric value "0" as a base for the vulnerable parameters. The injection is achieved by appending a malicious SQL statement after the zero.

**Vulnerable Application:**

*   ASPSiteWare RealtyListing versions 1.0 and 2.0

**Exploit Examples:**
