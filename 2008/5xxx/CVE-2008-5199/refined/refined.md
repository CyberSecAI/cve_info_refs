Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `include.php` file of the IdeBox application.
- The script uses the `$gorumDir` variable in include statements without proper sanitization.
- This allows an attacker to manipulate the `$gorumDir` variable via a GET request, forcing the application to include an arbitrary file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files into the application. This is due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `$gorumDir` variable.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the `$gorumDir` parameter before using it in `include()` statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to a full compromise of the server and the application.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive data, modify website content, or install backdoors for persistent access.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By including very large or repeatedly accessing malicious files, the attacker could cause a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `gorumDir` parameter in a HTTP GET request to the `include.php` script.
- **Remote File Inclusion:** The attacker supplies a malicious URL through the `gorumDir` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the target server running IdeBox.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable script:** The attacker needs to know the location of the `include.php` and the vulnerable parameter `gorumDir`.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable script path is `[Path]/include.php`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `gorumDir`.
- The vulnerable version of IdeBox is <= 1.1.
- The exploit example provided is: `http://xxxx/[Path]/include.php?gorumDir=[EVIL]`.
