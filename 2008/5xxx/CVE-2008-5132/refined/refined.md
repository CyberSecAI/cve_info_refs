Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5132:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The exploit-db.com entry explicitly mentions "CVE: 2008-5132" and details a SQL injection and code execution vulnerability in MemHT Portal 4.0.1. This confirms the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and filtering of user-supplied parameters in `inc/ajax/ajax_rating.php` and `inc/inc_login.php`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The `ajax_rating.php` file is susceptible to SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header.
    *   **IP Bypass:** The `inc_login.php` file allows bypassing IP restrictions using a comma in the input due to an inadequate regular expression.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by writing a PHP shell to a file within the web server's document root via a SQL injection.
    *   **Complete Compromise:** By gaining the ability to execute code, attackers can achieve full control of the vulnerable system.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *  The primary attack vector is sending a malicious HTTP request to `inc/ajax/ajax_rating.php` with a crafted `X-Forwarded-For` header containing SQL injection payload.
    *  The secondary attack vector is bypassing IP restrictions in `inc_login.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable MemHT Portal instance.
    *   The attacker needs to know (or be able to guess/bruteforce) the full server path to the portal installation or exploit the vulnerability that leaks the full path.
    *   MySQL should be able to write to file.

**3. Additional Details:**
* The provided exploit code first attempts to locate the server path by examining an error message from `lang/english.php`. If that is unsuccessful, it attempts to brute-force the path using common server paths.
* The exploit then crafts a malicious SQL query that writes a PHP shell to a file within the web server's document root.
* The exploit also attempts to bypass IP restrictions in `inc_login.php`
*   The exploit uses `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header to inject SQL.

**Summary:**

CVE-2008-5132 describes a critical vulnerability in MemHT Portal 4.0.1 that allows for SQL injection, leading to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in `inc/ajax/ajax_rating.php` and a flawed IP check in `inc/inc_login.php`. An attacker can exploit this by sending crafted HTTP requests, potentially achieving complete system compromise. The provided exploit script leverages this SQLi flaw.
