Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5138:

**Relevant Content:**

The content from `lists.debian.org` discusses a potential vulnerability related to insecure temporary file handling in several Debian packages. The `lists.opensuse.org` document confirms that `pam_mount` is affected by CVE-2008-5138.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `passwdehd` script in `pam_mount` creates temporary files in a predictable location (/tmp), making it vulnerable to symlink attacks.

**Weakness:**

Insecure temporary file handling. Specifically, the script creates temporary files in /tmp without proper checks to prevent symlink attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could create a symlink in /tmp with the same name as the temporary file used by `passwdehd`. When `passwdehd` attempts to write to the temporary file, it would instead write to the file pointed to by the symlink, potentially overwriting or corrupting system files, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vector:**

1.  Attacker identifies that `passwdehd` creates a temporary file in `/tmp/passwdehd.$$`
2.  Attacker creates a symbolic link in /tmp named `/tmp/passwdehd.$$` pointing to a system file they want to corrupt or overwrite.
3.  When `passwdehd` runs and attempts to write to `/tmp/passwdehd.$$`, it instead writes to the target file specified by the attacker's symlink.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local user access to the system to create symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.

**Additional Detail:**

The openSUSE report mentions that the `passwdehd` script was removed in versions 11.0 and 11.1 of openSUSE because it did not work on those distributions. This suggests the vulnerability was addressed by removing the vulnerable code in later versions.
