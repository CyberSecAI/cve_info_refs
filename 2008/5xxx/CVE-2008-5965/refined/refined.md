{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the `index.php` file. The `page` parameter from the GET request is not properly checked or filtered, allowing the attacker to pass a file path.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Check",
      "Improper Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can verify the existence of files and directories on the server. This could lead to information disclosure about the system's configuration and potentially aid in further exploitation.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a crafted `page` parameter containing a file path to check."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application."
  }
