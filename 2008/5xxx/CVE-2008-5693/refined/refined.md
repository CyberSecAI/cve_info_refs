Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability A: Authorization Bypassing in Log Visualization**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper session handling or authorization check within the WS\_FTP WebService. After logging out (or attempting to do so without being logged in), the application fails to invalidate the previous session and permits access to files within the `FTPLogServer` folder using a special "localhostnull" account.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to access log files without proper authentication.
    *   **Incorrect Session Handling:**  The logout process does not properly invalidate or terminate the session, allowing subsequent requests to be treated as if the user is still logged in with the mentioned special account.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can view sensitive log data from the WS\_FTP server, potentially exposing user credentials, activity information, and other security-relevant details.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited via network requests on the web administration interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network connectivity to the WS\_FTP WebService.
    *   **No prior authentication required:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to perform the attack. The vulnerability is triggered by simply attempting to log out without being logged in first.

**Vulnerability B: ASP Source Visualization**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of URLs with trailing dots. The web server does not properly sanitize or reject URLs that end with a dot, leading to the exposure of source code for ASP files.

*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
   *   **Source Code Disclosure:** The application's ASP source code is revealed to unauthorized users via a simple dot appended to the requested ASP file URL.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
     * **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially gain access to the web application's logic, database credentials, and other sensitive information by examining the source code. This could be used to facilitate further attacks.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by simply requesting an ASP file with a trailing dot.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the WS\_FTP WebService.
    *   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need a valid account to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description.
*   The identified vulnerabilities are present in WS\_FTP Server versions up to 6.1.0.0.
*   There is no patch or fix mentioned.
*   The ASP source visualization vulnerability has a lower severity than the authorization bypass.

**Summary**

The provided content details two vulnerabilities: a severe authorization bypass in log visualization and a less impactful ASP source code disclosure via malformed URLs. The authorization bypass is particularly concerning, as it grants unauthorized access to sensitive log data. Both can be exploited remotely over a network.
