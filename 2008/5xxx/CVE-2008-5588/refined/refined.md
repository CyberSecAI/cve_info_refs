Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-5588:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `siteID` parameter of the `rankup.asp` script in the RankEm application. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `siteID` parameter.  The attacker can inject malicious SQL code that is then executed by the database server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other potentially confidential information.  Examples provided show the ability to extract the database version, usernames and passwords from the `TBLsites` table
- **Partial Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability Impact**: According to the CVSS vector provided in the securityreason.com content, the impact is partial for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `rankup.asp` script, including malicious SQL code in the `siteID` parameter.
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required**: The attack can be performed without prior authentication.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious queries.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- **Vulnerable Application:** RankEm
- **Vulnerable Script:** rankup.asp
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** siteID
- **Exploit Examples:** The provided content includes examples of how to exploit the SQL injection, including extracting the database version and retrieving username and password from the database:
    ```
    http://target.com/rankup.asp?siteID=convert(int,(select+@@version));--
    http://www.top50.co.nz/rankup.asp?siteID=convert(int,(select+top+1+siteUserName+from+TBLsites));--
    http://www.top50.co.nz/rankup.asp?siteID=convert(int,(select+top+1+sitePassword+from+TBLsites));--
    ```
- **CWE:** CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command)
- **CVSS Base Score:** 7.5/10 (per securityreason.com content)

**Summary:**
The content describes a remote SQL injection vulnerability in the `rankup.asp` script of the RankEm application, triggered by a lack of sanitization of the `siteID` parameter. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries to access sensitive database information.
