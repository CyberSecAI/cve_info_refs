Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-5985:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the Python interface within Epiphany (and other applications) handles module search paths. Specifically, the `PySys_SetArgv` function, when called with an `argv[0]` that doesn't resolve to a filename, causes Python to prepend the current working directory (cwd) to the `sys.path`. This allows Python to search for modules in the current directory before the standard module paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Untrusted Search Path:** The primary vulnerability is an untrusted search path. By prepending the current working directory to `sys.path`, the application can inadvertently load and execute arbitrary code from a specially crafted Python module located in the same directory where Epiphany was launched.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local attacker can create a malicious Python module with the same name as one Epiphany tries to import. When a user is tricked into launching Epiphany from that directory, the malicious module will be executed with the user's privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although the execution is under the user's privileges, this can still lead to significant damage if the user has elevated privileges or sensitive data access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to place a malicious Python module within a directory and then persuade the user to run Epiphany from that directory.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to rely on social engineering tactics to make the user launch Epiphany from the compromised directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create files on the target user's file system.
*   **Social Engineering Skill:** The attacker needs to persuade the victim to launch the application from a specific, attacker-controlled directory.
*   **Knowledge of the application's module imports:** The attacker must know which python modules the application imports in order to create the malicious module with the correct name.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because Python's relative import mechanism is exploited.
*   The issue is not easily fixable on the Python side due to compatibility concerns with other Python packages.
*   The fix is to sanitize `sys.path`, removing the potentially dangerous entry which points to the current working directory.
*   A patch was proposed which removes the empty string from `sys.path`.  However, some libc implementations return the current working directory when `realpath` is called on an empty string, requiring alternative fixes that remove the first entry of `sys.path` or use a garbage path in `PySys_SetArgv` and filter it out.

**Affected Software:**

*   The provided information specifically mentions that Epiphany is affected.  However, other applications like csound, dia, eog, gedit, xchat, vim, nautilus-python, and Gnumeric are affected by the same underlying Python issue.
*   The vulnerability is present in Python versions prior to 2.6.
