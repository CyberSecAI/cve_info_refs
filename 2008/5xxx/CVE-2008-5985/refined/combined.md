# Epiphany: Untrusted search path — GLSA **200903-16**

An untrusted search path vulnerability in Epiphany might result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/epiphany** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.22.3-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.22.3-r2** |

### Background

Epiphany is a GNOME webbrowser based on the Mozilla rendering engine
Gecko.

### Description

James Vega reported an untrusted search path vulnerability in the
Python interface.

### Impact

A local attacker could entice a user to run Epiphany from a directory
containing a specially crafted python module, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Epiphany.

### Workaround

Do not run "epiphany" from untrusted working directories.

### Resolution

All Epiphany users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/epiphany-2.22.3-r2"
```

Subject: CVE request -- Python < 2.6 PySys_SetArgv issues (epiphany,
	csound, dia, eog, gedit, xchat, vim, nautilus-python, Gnumeric)

Hello Steve,

  initially CVE-2008-4863 has been assigned for the Blender's
untrusted search path issue.

Though this is a Python flaw (insertion of cwd at the
beginning of the Python modules search path), according to our Python
maintainers it can't be fixed on Python's side due the need
of ensuring the work of other numerous packages, when loading
Python modules.

Similar flaw, like the Blender one, has been discovered in
the following packages:

```
Package: ephiphany-browser
Version: 2.22.3-6
Severity: grave
Tags: security patch upstream
Justification: user security hole
Usertags: pythonpath

Epiphany's python interface calls PySys_SetArgv with an argv[0] that
doesn't resolve to a filename.  This causes Python to prepend sys.path
with an empty string which, due to the use of relative imports, allows
the possibility to run arbitrary code on the user's system if a file in
their working directory matches the name of a python module epiphany
tries to import.

This should be fixed by Python 2.6 as it uses absolute imports by
default, but I have not been able to test it and this still needs a fix
for packages built against/used with the currently supported versions of
Python.

Hey James,

would you please take a minute to file the Python path patches upstream
in bugzilla.gnome.org? We will appreciate it.
Please do so for the following products that share this code: nautilus,
totem, epiphany, eog. I might be missing one, so don't feel restricted
to only those :-).

Thanks in advance!

Diego

As I discovered while discussing the Python path patch with Vim's
upstream[0], the patch I suggested to fix these bugs only works if the
libc follows SUS' definition[1] of how realpath(3) works.

Specifically, it must return NULL when given an empty string for the
path.  At least FreeBSD instead returns the current working directory of
the process[2], which means that removing the empty elements from
sys.path no longer has an effect.

When sending bug reports to your respective upstream, I'd suggest either
adjusting the patch to simply remove the first element of sys.path or
give a garbage path to PySys_SetArgv and explicitly filter that out of
sys.path (as was done by Vim's upstream[3]).

I don't have a bugzilla account for Gnome and would appreciate it if the
package maintainers could push this upstream instead as they likely
already have one.

I'm still working through the list of packages I've found albeit not as
fast as I would've liked.  All of the projects you mentioned are in the
list and will (if they haven't already) will have Debian bugs opened for
the problem.
