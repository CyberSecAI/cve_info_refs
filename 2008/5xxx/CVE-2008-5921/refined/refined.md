Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5921

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the Umer Inc Songs Portal Script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in the `albums.php` file. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords, by injecting malicious SQL code.
- Unauthorized Access: Exploitation could lead to gaining unauthorized access to the application and possibly the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `albums.php`: The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes a SQL injection payload within the `id` parameter.
- Example Attack URL: `http://www.site.com/albums.php?id=16+union+select+1,concat(username,0x3a,password),3,4,5+from+admin--`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely via a web browser.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection: The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax and how to construct SQL injection queries.
