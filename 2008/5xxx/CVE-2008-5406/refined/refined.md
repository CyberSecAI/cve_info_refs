Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is an off-by-one buffer overflow when handling long arguments within a .mov file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Off-by-One Overflow:**  The application fails to properly handle long arguments within a .mov file, leading to a buffer overflow of one byte.
- **Lack of /GS flag (in iTunes):**  While QuickTime is compiled with the /GS stack cookie protection, iTunes is not. This allows the overflow to potentially lead to code execution in iTunes, rather than just a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution (in iTunes):** The vulnerability, when triggered via iTunes, can allow an attacker to gain control of the EAX and EDI registers.  With careful crafting of the payload, this could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service (Quicktime):** QuickTime crashes due to the /GS cookie protection, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Control of Registers (EAX & EDI):** The provided proof of concept demonstrates the ability to control the EAX and EDI registers, a key primitive in exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious .mov File:** The attacker provides a crafted .mov file with overly long arguments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious .mov file to a user that opens it with iTunes. This could be through a malicious website, a phishing email, or any other way of distributing a malicious file.
- Basic knowledge of memory corruption techniques.
- Understanding of the file structure of .mov files in order to craft the necessary payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects iTunes 8.0.2.20 and QuickTime 7.5.5 on Windows and OS X.
- The exploit is described as a "Multiple Off By One Overflow."
- The provided exploit code controls only 41 bytes of the buffer after accounting for the EDI and EAX registers.
- The PoC gives control of the EAX & EDI registers.

**CVE-2008-5406 Summary:**
An off-by-one buffer overflow exists in iTunes 8.0.2.20 and QuickTime 7.5.5 when processing .mov files with overly long arguments. The vulnerability can be exploited in iTunes to gain control of the EAX and EDI registers and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, while QuickTime crashes, due to a stack protection.
