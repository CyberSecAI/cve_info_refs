The provided content is a security bulletin that directly relates to CVE-2008-5796. It details multiple vulnerabilities found in several third-party TYPO3 extensions.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** This vulnerability is present in multiple extensions:
    *   `advcalendar` (versions 0.3.1 and below)
    *   `cms_poll` (versions 0.1.0 and below)
    *   `eluna_pagecomments` (versions 1.1.2 and below)
    *   `fsmi_people` (versions 0.0.24 and below)
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This vulnerability is present in:
    *   `eluna_pagecomments` (versions 1.1.2 and below)
    *   `fsmi_people` (versions 0.0.24 and below)
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** This vulnerability is present in:
    *   `rtgdictionary` (versions 0.1.9 and below)

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerabilities stem from insecure coding practices within the third-party extensions, specifically:

*   Failure to properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries (SQL Injection)
*   Failure to sanitize user inputs when outputting data in the browser (XSS)
*   Insecure handling of data or execution paths leading to arbitrary code execution

**Impact:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database. Could also allow for privilege escalation.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can be used to steal cookies, redirect to malicious sites, or deface web pages.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vectors involve sending malicious input to the vulnerable TYPO3 extensions through the web interface.
*   SQL injection is exploited by crafting malicious SQL queries through the vulnerable extensions.
*   XSS is exploited by injecting malicious scripts that are later rendered by the web browser.
*   Arbitrary code execution is achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the code that allow the execution of server-side code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the TYPO3 application interface and send manipulated requests.
*   No specific level of access is mentioned, but the attacker would likely need to be able to interact with the vulnerable extensions through the web interface.

**Additional Information:**

*   The bulletin indicates that vulnerable versions of `advcalendar` and `eluna_pagecomments` were removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository.
*   Updated versions were available for `cms_poll`, `fsmi_people`, and `rtgdictionary`.
*   The bulletin recommends uninstalling the vulnerable extensions where no updates were available.
*   The bulletin also urges users to follow the security guidelines in the TYPO3 Security Guide and subscribe to the `typo3-announce` mailing list for future security updates.
