Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-5770:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `phpweather` application, specifically in the `test.php` script, allowing local file inclusion (LFI).
*   The `require` statement in `test.php` uses a variable derived from user input (`$language`) without proper sanitization, making it vulnerable to LFI.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  The application includes files based on user-controlled input, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A separate XSS vulnerability exists in `config/make_config.php`

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **LFI:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the server, including source code, configuration files, or other confidential information.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject arbitrary javascript code, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **LFI:** By manipulating the `language` parameter in `test.php`, an attacker can specify a path to a local file that the application will then include.
*  **LFI:** By manipulating the `cc` parameter in `index.php`, an attacker can specify a path to a local file that the application will then include.
*   **XSS:** By injecting malicious javascript into the `config/make_config.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not require prior authentication or any specific user level.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides specific vulnerable code line in `test.php`: `require(PHPWEATHER_BASE_DIR . "/output/pw_text_$language.php");`
*   The exploit-db entry also shows example attack URLs for both LFI and XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   LFI examples: `www.site.com/path/test.php?metar=()&language=[Lfi]%00` and `www.site.com/path/index.php?cc=[Lfi]`
    *   XSS example: `www.site.com/path/config/make_config.php/>"><ScRiPt>alert(0)</ScRiPt>`
*   The vulnerable application is identified as `phpweather-2.2.2`.
*   The exploit-db entry mentions that the vulnerability was published in 2008-12-14.
