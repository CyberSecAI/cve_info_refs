Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5507:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox (and related products like Iceape, Icedove and Thunderbird) handles JavaScript URLs that redirect to off-domain resources. When a same-domain JavaScript URL redirects to an off-domain target which contains data that is not parsable as JavaScript, a syntax error occurs. This error, when caught by the `window.onerror` handler, can reveal parts of the file context, leading to cross-domain information leakage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-domain information leakage:** The core vulnerability lies in the ability of a malicious website to access data from another domain by exploiting a redirection within a JavaScript URL and capturing error information.
*   **Improper handling of redirected JavaScript URLs:** The browser does not properly protect user data when accessing a same-domain JavaScript URL that redirects to an unparsable JavaScript off-site resource.
*   **Information disclosure via error messages:** The JavaScript error messages sometimes include text from the content that failed to parse, which can then be leaked as a cross-domain breach via the `window.onerror` handler.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information theft:** Attackers can steal a limited amount of data, which may include private or sensitive information from the users that are authenticated to the redirected website.
*   **Phishing:** As indicated by CVE-2008-5508, URLs with leading whitespaces or control characters can lead to phishing attacks as well. The original vulnerability detailed in this CVE is used as part of an attack chain to extract information.
*   The amount of data that can be stolen is dependent on the format of the remote data. Some data formats may allow repeated loading of the script to extract additional data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious website:** A malicious site loads a same-domain JavaScript URL that redirects to an off-domain resource. The `window.onerror` API is used to steal data.
*   **Redirect trick:** Attackers can bypass the protection introduced in Firefox 3.0.4 by redirecting a same-domain javascript file to off-domain resources.
*   **Cross-domain script inclusion:** Attackers can load a script from a remote domain. The remote data, which does not have to be script, has an effect on the evil domain doing the inclusion, leading to cross-domain data leakage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to host a malicious website:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage to initiate the attack.
*   **Ability to redirect URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to set up a redirection from a same-domain javascript URL to an off-domain resource.
*   **Victim interaction:** The user needs to be tricked into visiting the malicious website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Chris Evans.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 2.0.0.19, 2.0.0.20, and 3.0.5, as well as Iceape 1.0.13, Icedove 1.5.0.13+1.5.0.15b, and Thunderbird 2.0.0.19.
*   The vulnerability also affects SeaMonkey, which uses the Firefox browser engine and was patched in version 1.1.14.
*   The "302 redirect trick" mentioned in some reports allows attackers to bypass protections in Firefox 3.0.4
*   The vulnerability is related to similar issue ([https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=363897](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=363897)) but the original fix can be bypassed with the redirector trick
*   The vulnerability could be used to steal textual data such as words, or CSV data using a loop to extract variable information.

This detailed analysis should provide a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its exploitation, and its impact.
