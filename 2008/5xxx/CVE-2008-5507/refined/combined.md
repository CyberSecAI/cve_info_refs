How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Firefox cross-domain information theft (simple text strings, some CSV)

---

Programs affected: Firefox 2, Firefox 3.

Fixed: Firefox 2.0.0.19, Firefox 3.0.5

Severity: Cross-domain information leakage.

[CVE-2008-5507](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5507)

[MFSA 2008-65](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2008/mfsa2008-65.html)The modern web model permits remote domain <script> inclusion with no
restrictions. If the remote data, which does not have to be script, has an
effect on the evil domain doing the inclusion, you have a cross-domain data
leak.Firefox supports the property `window.onerror` which is called on
any JavaScript error message. Occasionally, some JavaScript error messages
includes text from the content that failed to parse or run. That text, then,
is leaked as a cross-domain breach. Firefox 3 is wise to this trick, probably
thanks to Filipe Almeida (see credit below). Firefox 3.0.4 would replace the
JavaScript error text with a generic message in the event that the error is
generated by script on a remote domain. However, the "302 redirect trick"
bypasses that protection. Firefox 2.0.0.18 did not need any such tricks to
reveal information.The best error message to target is "blah is not defined", referring to a
textual name that is not currently bound to a variable. You can cross-domain
steal data that is a single word in this manner. If the cross-domain data
is CSV, e.g. "a, b, c", you can steal the text of all three words by
iteratively sourcing the script, noting the undefined variable name, defining
it and repeating. Other textual error messages may reveal other data for
specific textual constructs on the remote domain.Little demo (hit refresh if nothing happens):

### Credits

* Filipe Almeida, who was on top of abusing remote script includes to steal
  simple pieces of information a long long time ago.
* Google - found on Google's time.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2008-65

## Cross-domain data theft via script redirect error message

Announced
December 16, 2008
Reporter
Chris Evans
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.19
* Firefox 2.0.0.20
* Firefox 3.0.5
* SeaMonkey 1.1.14
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.19

### Description

Google security researcher **Chris Evans** reported that a
website could access a limited amount of data from a different domain by
loading a same-domain JavaScript URL which redirects to an off-domain
target resource containing data
which is not parsable as JavaScript. Upon attempting to load the data as
JavaScript a syntax error is generated that can reveal some of the file
context via the `window.onerror` DOM API.

This issue could be used by a malicious website to steal private data
from users who are authenticated on the redirected website. How much
data could be at risk would depend on the format of the data and how
the JavaScript parser attempts to interpret it. For most files the
amount of data that can be recovered would be limited to the first
word or two. Some data files might allow deeper probing with
repeated loads.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.

**Update December 18, 2008:** The Windows version of Firefox
2.0.0.19 was shipped without the fix for this issue (other platforms
were correctly patched). Firefox 2.0.0.20 has been released on Windows
to correct this oversight.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. If a user had Javascript

enabled, these problems could allow an attacker to crash Thunderbird and

possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-5500](/security/CVE-2008-5500))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that the same-origin check in Thunderbird could be

bypassed by utilizing XBL-bindings. If a user had Javascript enabled, an

attacker could exploit this to read data from other domains. ([CVE-2008-5503](/security/CVE-2008-5503))

Marius Schilder discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle redirects

to an outside domain when an XMLHttpRequest was made to a same-origin resource.

When Javascript is enabled, it's possible that sensitive information could be

revealed in the XMLHttpRequest response. ([CVE-2008-5506](/security/CVE-2008-5506))

Chris Evans discovered that Thunderbird did not properly protect a user's data

when accessing a same-domain Javascript URL that is redirected to an unparsable

Javascript off-site resource. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious

website and had Javascript enabled, an attacker may be able to steal a limited

amount of private data. ([CVE-2008-5507](/security/CVE-2008-5507))

Chip Salzenberg, Justin Schuh, Tom Cross, and Peter William discovered

Thunderbird did not properly parse URLs when processing certain control

characters. ([CVE-2008-5508](/security/CVE-2008-5508))

Kojima Hajime discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle an escaped

null character. An attacker may be able to exploit this flaw to bypass script

sanitization. ([CVE-2008-5510](/security/CVE-2008-5510))

Several flaws were discovered in the Javascript engine. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had Javascript enabled, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary Javascript code within the context of another

website or with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5511](/security/CVE-2008-5511), [CVE-2008-5512](/security/CVE-2008-5512))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-701-2: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

6 January 2009

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [mozilla-thunderbird](/security/cves?package=mozilla-thunderbird) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. If a user had Javascript

enabled, these problems could allow an attacker to crash Thunderbird and

possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-5500](/security/CVE-2008-5500))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that the same-origin check in Thunderbird could be

bypassed by utilizing XBL-bindings. If a user had Javascript enabled, an

attacker could exploit this to read data from other domains. ([CVE-2008-5503](/security/CVE-2008-5503))

Marius Schilder discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle redirects

to an outside domain when an XMLHttpRequest was made to a same-origin resource.

When Javascript is enabled, it's possible that sensitive information could be

revealed in the XMLHttpRequest response. ([CVE-2008-5506](/security/CVE-2008-5506))

Chris Evans discovered that Thunderbird did not properly protect a user's data

when accessing a same-domain Javascript URL that is redirected to an unparsable

Javascript off-site resource. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious

website and had Javascript enabled, an attacker may be able to steal a limited

amount of private data. ([CVE-2008-5507](/security/CVE-2008-5507))

Chip Salzenberg, Justin Schuh, Tom Cross, and Peter William discovered

Thunderbird did not properly parse URLs when processing certain control

characters. ([CVE-2008-5508](/security/CVE-2008-5508))

Several flaws were discovered in the Javascript engine. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had Javascript enabled, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary Javascript code within the context of another

website or with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5511](/security/CVE-2008-5511), [CVE-2008-5512](/security/CVE-2008-5512))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [mozilla-thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mozilla-thunderbird)
  -
  [1.5.0.13+1.5.0.15~prepatch080614i-0ubuntu0.6.06.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mozilla-thunderbird/1.5.0.13%2B1.5.0.15~prepatch080614i-0ubuntu0.6.06.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Thunderbird to effect

the necessary changes.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. These problems could allow

an attacker to crash the browser and possibly execute arbitrary code with user

privileges. ([CVE-2008-5500](/security/CVE-2008-5500))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that the same-origin check in Firefox could be

bypassed by utilizing XBL-bindings. An attacker could exploit this to read data

from other domains. ([CVE-2008-5503](/security/CVE-2008-5503))

Several problems were discovered in the JavaScript engine. An attacker could

exploit feed preview vulnerabilities to execute scripts from page content with

chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5504](/security/CVE-2008-5504))

Marius Schilder discovered that Firefox did not properly handle redirects to

an outside domain when an XMLHttpRequest was made to a same-origin resource.

It's possible that sensitive information could be revealed in the

XMLHttpRequest response. ([CVE-2008-5506](/security/CVE-2008-5506))

Chris Evans discovered that Firefox did not properly protect a user's data when

accessing a same-domain Javascript URL that is redirected to an unparsable

Javascript off-site resource. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious

website, an attacker may be able to steal a limited amount of private data.

([CVE-2008-5507](/security/CVE-2008-5507))

Chip Salzenberg, Justin Schuh, Tom Cross, and Peter William discovered Firefox

did not properly parse URLs when processing certain control characters.

([CVE-2008-5508](/security/CVE-2008-5508))

Kojima Hajime discovered that Firefox did not properly handle an escaped null

character. An attacker may be able to exploit this flaw to bypass script

sanitization. ([CVE-2008-5510](/security/CVE-2008-5510))

Several flaws were discovered in the Javascript engine. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to execute

arbitrary Javascript code within the context of another website or with chrome

privileges. ([CVE-2008-5511](/security/CVE-2008-5511), [CVE-2008-5512](/security/CVE-2008-5512))

Flaws were discovered in the session-restore feature of Firefox. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to

perform cross-site scripting attacks or execute arbitrary Javascript code with

chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5513](/security/CVE-2008-5513))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [2.0.0.19+nobinonly1-0ubuntu0.7.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/2.0.0.19%2Bnobinonly1-0ubuntu0.7.10.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox to effect the

necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86\_64); en-US; rv:1.8.1.16) Gecko/20080716 Firefox/2.0.0.16
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86\_64); en-US; rv:1.8.1.16) Gecko/20080716 Firefox/2.0.0.16
The URL above demos the problem nicely. Note that this is with FF3.0.3.
This is essentially a new twist to the existing bug:
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=363897](/show_bug.cgi?id=363897 "RESOLVED FIXED - Don't give onerror handlers detailed information about syntax errors in off-site \"scripts\"")
This bug was fixed in FF3, but the fix can be bypassed with the redirector trick.
Also note that the bug referenced above underestimates the severity of leaking JS error messages cross-domain. Hopefully my demo illustrates that.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.

bz, is this the same issue you mentioned in 363897 [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=461735#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Security: theft of strings cross-domain with redirect, <script src> and window.onerror")?

Somewhat. Fixing that issue would certainly fix this bug, but we can fix this bug without going to a principal-based check here.

By the way, theft is not limited to just a single word. If you have a CSV file such as:
a, b, 12345, c
Then is it possible to steal the textual content "a", "b" and "c" by:
- Steal "a" using above trick.
- Define "a" and rerun exploit.
- Steal "b" using above trick.
- etc., repeat
Strongly recommend backport to FF2

Would be good to get trunk/beta baking so that this can land on branches ASAP.

With both 1.8.1.18 and the nightly 1.8.1.19 build, <http://cevans-app.appspot.com/static/ff3scriptredirbug.html> gives an alert that looks like:

Looks like [bug 363897](/show_bug.cgi?id=363897 "RESOLVED FIXED - Don't give onerror handlers detailed information about syntax errors in off-site \"scripts\"") never got fixed on the 1.8 branch, does this fix rely on that one?

This doesn't seem fixed (again)!
Using the official 1.8.1.19 release build on OS X, when I go to <http://cevans-app.appspot.com/static/ff3scriptredirbug.html>, I still get an alert that
looks like:
"The page at <http://cevans-app.appspot.com> says:
dd2afe8343e40cf09400b581912d0e6f is not defined at
<http://csftpd.beasts.org/steal_me/hex.txt>: 1"
This is the unfixed behavior.
On 3.0.5 and Trunk, I get an alert stating:
"The page at <http://cevans-app.appspot.com> says:
Script error.

Due to an error, the win32 builds that shipped today for Firefox 2.0.0.19 do not contain the fix from [bug 363897](/show_bug.cgi?id=363897 "RESOLVED FIXED - Don't give onerror handlers detailed information about syntax errors in off-site \"scripts\""), so the fix from this bug doesn't work there.

But it was verified in the builds we built, and shipped on two out of three platforms. It's better to clone the bug for win32 I think.Keywords: [verified1.8.1.19](/buglist.cgi?keywords=verified1.8.1.19&resolution=---)

After installation of 3.0.5, I am facing problem with Greasemonkey scripts. by any chance has this fix resulted into a issue similar to [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=405394](/show_bug.cgi?id=405394 "RESOLVED INACTIVE - Greasemonkey -- \"security manager vetoed\" when accessing HTMLEmbedElement.wrappedJSObject.<anything>") ?

It's not quite, though it's pretty similar. Actually, it's even more similar to [bug 363897](/show_bug.cgi?id=363897 "RESOLVED FIXED - Don't give onerror handlers detailed information about syntax errors in off-site \"scripts\""), where we suppressed the line number and error text but not the filename.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
