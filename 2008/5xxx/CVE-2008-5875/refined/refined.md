Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5875:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Joomla! component `com_lowcosthotels` is vulnerable to Blind SQL injection. This occurs because the component does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `id` parameter within the `showhoteldetails` task. The attacker can't directly see the results, hence "blind."
- Lack of input sanitization:  The component fails to properly validate and sanitize the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database and potentially retrieve sensitive information.
- Depending on the database user permissions, an attacker might be able to modify or delete data.
- The attack could be used to escalate privileges or to achieve full control of the affected application/server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! component.
- The attacker crafts a URL with the vulnerable component (com_lowcosthotels) and injects SQL code into the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! website.
- No authentication is required for exploitation.
- Knowledge of SQL and how to perform blind SQL injections is necessary.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit examples demonstrate how an attacker can use SQL injection techniques with `substring(@@version,1,1)` to determine the database server version.
- The examples show how to test the injection with boolean-based blind SQLi:
    - `http://www.leveltensolutions.net/spa/index.php?option=com_lowcosthotels&task=showhoteldetails&id=13+and%20substring(@@version,1,1)=5`
    - `http://www.leveltensolutions.net/spa/index.php?option=com_lowcosthotels&task=showhoteldetails&id=13+and%20substring(@@version,1,1)=4`

**Additional Notes:**
