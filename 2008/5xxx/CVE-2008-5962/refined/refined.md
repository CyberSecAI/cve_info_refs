  "CVE-2008-5962": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `rpc.php` script in Gravity GTD 0.4.5 uses a user-controlled parameter to include a PHP file and evaluate an object name. Specifically, the script uses the `$_REQUEST['objectname']` parameter directly in an include statement and an `eval` statement.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
        "Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
        "Unvalidated user input",
        "Use of `include` with user-supplied path",
        "Use of `eval` with user-supplied code"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary files on the server (LFI) or execute arbitrary PHP code (RCE) on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": "HTTP GET requests to the `rpc.php` script with a specially crafted `objectname` parameter.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where Gravity GTD is installed."
