Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5818

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `index.php` script of eDContainer v2.22. Specifically, the script uses the `$_REQUEST['lg']` parameter directly to construct a filename for inclusion without sufficient validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI, which allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem into the application's execution context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read sensitive files on the server by including them via the vulnerable `$_REQUEST['lg']` parameter. This could expose configuration files, database credentials, source code, and other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a web request to the `index.php` script.
- The attacker manipulates the `lg` parameter in the URL to include the path to the file they want to read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `index.php` script and the `lg` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
if ( isset($_REQUEST['lg']) ) { $INDEX['currentLanguage'] = $_REQUEST['lg']; } else if ( !isset( $INDEX['currentLanguage'] ) ) {
 	$INDEX['currentLanguage']  = $CONFIG['language']['default'];
}
require_once 'myContents_'.$INDEX['currentLanguage'].'.php';
```
- The code takes the value from `$_REQUEST['lg']` and appends `.php` to it, and includes the resulting file. By setting `lg` to `../../../../index`, the script will try to include `myContents_../../../../index.php`, which will include the index.php file itself. This allows arbitrary file inclusion if the attacker supplies an absolute or relative path to a file they want to include.
