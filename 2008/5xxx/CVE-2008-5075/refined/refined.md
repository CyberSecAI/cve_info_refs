Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-5075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability within the E-Uploader Pro application. Specifically, user-supplied input to the `view`, and `id` parameters of multiple PHP files are not sanitized, allowing malicious SQL queries to be injected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks in several PHP files including `browser.php`, `img.php`, `file.php`, `mail.php`, `thumb.php`, `zip.php`, and `zipit.php`. Specifically, these files take unsanitized user-provided parameters `view`, and `id`  allowing an attacker to manipulate SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials (`user`, `pass` from `users` table, or `admin_user` and `admin_pass` from the `settings` table).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker could gain access to administrative credentials, potentially leading to complete control over the application.
*   **Database Manipulation:** Beyond extracting information, an attacker could modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploited through specially crafted HTTP GET requests to various PHP files.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:**  The `view` and `id` parameters within the GET requests are used to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious SQL queries.
*   **Knowledge of Application Structure:** The attacker would need to know the location of the installation directory to form the correct URLs.
*   **`magic_quotes_gpc` off:**  The server must have `magic_quotes_gpc` set to "off" for the exploit to be successful.

**Vulnerable Application:**
*   E-Uploader Pro <= 1.0

**Exploit Examples:**
The content provides several example exploits:

*   `http://localhost/[installdir]/browser.php?view='+union+select+1,concat_ws(0x3a,user,pass),3,4,5,6,7+from+users/*`
*   `http://localhost/[installdir]/browser.php?view='+union+select+1,concat_ws(0x3a,admin_user,admin_pass),3,4,5,6,7+from+settings/*`
*   `http://localhost/[installdir]/img.php?id='+union+select+1,2,user()/*`
*   `http://localhost/[installdir]/file.php?id='+union+select+1,2,3/*`
*   `http://localhost/[installdir]/mail.php?id='+union+select+1,2,3/*`
*   `http://localhost/[installdir]/thumb.php?id='+union+select+1,2,user()/*`
*  `http://localhost/[installdir]/zip.php?id='+union+select+1,2,3/*`
*   `http://localhost/[installdir]/zipit.php?id='+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7/*`
