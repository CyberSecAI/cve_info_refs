Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2008-5768:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `print.php` file of the Amevents module for XOOPS.
- The `id` parameter in the `print.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords (as shown in the example payload extracting `uname` and `pass` from `xoops_users`).
    - Data modification: Modifying or deleting data.
    - Potential complete compromise of the application and underlying database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and through the web.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter of the `print.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and basic SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content includes example URLs and SQL injection payloads, which demonstrate how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as high risk with a CVSS base score of 7.5/10
- The exploit is confirmed to be easily exploitable with low complexity.
- References to external resources (XForce, SecurityFocus, and milw0rm) are included for more information.
- The vulnerability affects the XOOPS Module Amevents.
