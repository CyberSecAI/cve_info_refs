Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5692:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** The primary vulnerability lies in the improper handling of user sessions within the WS_FTP Server Manager's web interface, specifically within the `FTPLogServer` folder. After logging out of the web interface (or not being logged in at all), the system fails to properly invalidate the session state, allowing access to the log files via a "localhostnull" account.
*   **ASP Source Code Disclosure:** A secondary issue, considered minor, is that by appending a dot to the end of ASP file URLs (e.g., `login.asp.`), an attacker can view the source code of these files. This allows insight into the application logic and possible further vulnerabilities, but is stated as having no "impact" as it is not considered a classical web server where custom contents could be present.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Session Handling:** The web application does not properly invalidate sessions after logout and allows a generic "localhostnull" session to persist, granting unauthorized access.
*   **ASP Source Code Exposure:** The web server does not prevent the direct viewing of ASP source code through a trivial URL modification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Log Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and gain access to view and download log files stored by the WS_FTP Server. These logs could potentially contain sensitive information about file transfers, user activity, or other server operations.
*   **Potential Information Leakage:** While explicitly stated to have no impact, source code disclosure of ASP files could lead to the exposure of credentials, business logic, or other sensitive implementation details.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers exploit the vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the server.
*   **URL Manipulation:** Specifically, the authorization bypass requires logging out of the web server (or not logging in), then accessing the `FTPLogServer` ASP files. The source code disclosure occurs by appending a dot to the file name in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running WS_FTP Server, either within the same LAN or over the internet.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The primary authorization bypass vulnerability does not require prior user authentication. The attacker only needs access to the web server's URL.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the `FTPLogServer` folder of the WS\_FTP WebService.
*   The exploit for the authorization bypass involves logging out of the server (or not logging in), then sending a request to `http://SERVER/WSFTPSVR/FTPLogServer/LogViewer.asp`
*   The source code disclosure affects files like `login.asp`, `LogViewer.asp`, and `ViewCert.asp`.
*   The described vulnerabilities affect WS_FTP Server versions 6.1.0.0 and earlier.
*  The documents note that this is the same bug in the web interface of Whatsup Gold.
* There was no official fix available at the time of the security report by Luigi Auriemma.
