Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `cTrigger::DoIt()` function of the Verlihub software, where user-provided input is passed unsanitized to the `system()` function. Specifically, the software allows users to define "triggers" that, when invoked, execute shell commands. The input provided as arguments to these triggers is directly appended to a command string and executed without any sanitization, leading to command injection. Additionally, a temporary file creation in `/tmp` is also vulnerable to symlink attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization before passing user-controlled data to the `system()` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
2.  **Symlink Vulnerability:** The software creates a temporary file `/tmp/trigger.tmp`, making it susceptible to symlink attacks where a malicious user could create a symbolic link to a sensitive file and then cause the application to overwrite it.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server. If the Verlihub daemon is running as root, the attacker gains complete control of the machine.
*   **Data Loss/System Compromise:** Due to symlink vulnerability, a malicious user could prepare a `/tmp/trigger.tmp` file to cause serious data loss or compromise a system.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is remote, via a user connected to the vulnerable Verlihub hub. The attacker sends a specially crafted argument when triggering a user-defined trigger. The argument contains shell commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be a user connected to a vulnerable Verlihub server.
*   The server must have the `allow_exec` configuration option enabled, allowing user-defined triggers with arguments.

**Additional details:**

The provided exploit example shows the attacker running a trigger with the argument `\`cat /etc/passwd\``, which demonstrates reading the password file as an example. The provided patch attempts to address the issue by filtering several potentially dangerous characters and switching from `system()` to `popen()`. The vulnerability is confirmed to affect Verlihub version 0.9.8d-RC2 and possibly earlier versions.
