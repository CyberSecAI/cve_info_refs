## CVE-2008-5702

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in an off-by-one error within the `ibwdt_ioctl` function of the `ib700wdt` watchdog driver in the Linux kernel. Specifically, the issue occurs in the `ibwdt_set_heartbeat` function where the `wd_margin` variable could be set to -1 because of incorrect logic when a specific `timeout` value was requested, leading to an out of bound access of the `wd_times` array during `WDIOC_GETTIMEOUT` ioctl.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Underflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer underflow. The `wd_margin` index can become -1, causing out-of-bounds access to the `wd_times` array within the `ibwdt_ioctl` function when WDIOC_GETTIMEOUT is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation could lead to a system crash or other undefined behavior due to the kernel memory corruption, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Unknown Impact:** The SUSE advisory notes the impact is "unknown", although a crash is the most likely result.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a local user who has access to the `/dev/watchdog` device node.
*   **Specifically Crafted IOCTL Call:** The attack requires the attacker to make a specially crafted `WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT` ioctl call, using a timeout value of 30, causing a buffer underflow, followed by `WDIOC_GETTIMEOUT` ioctl call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   **Device Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make ioctl calls to the `/dev/watchdog` device, which is typically accessible to privileged users but in some systems unprivileged users might also have access to the device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Debian security advisory DSA-1794-1 mentions that this vulnerability can lead to denial of service.
*   The openSUSE security advisory SUSE-SA:2009:010 describes the vulnerability and notes that the impact is "unknown" via certain `WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT` ioctl call.
*   The openSUSE security advisory SUSE-SA:2009:030 also lists this CVE as a local denial of service vulnerability.
*   The Ubuntu security notice USN-715-1 describes this vulnerability as a buffer size check problem leading to a system crash and DoS.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `drivers/watchdog/ib700wdt.c` file.
*   The fix for this issue involves modifying the logic in the `ibwdt_set_heartbeat` function to correctly set the `wd_margin`.
*   The vulnerability was found by a static checker.
*   The vulnerable code exists in Linux kernel versions prior to the fix commit 7c2500f.
