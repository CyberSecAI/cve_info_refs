How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Bug: writing of a NULL byte in the memory
Exploitation: remote
Date: 08 Feb 2008
Author: Luigi Auriemma

#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
All the products developed by IEA Software use some web servers for the
remote administration of the services.
The following are the programs which run this web interface and the
ports on which they listen:
- emerwebsrv, 80 and 443
- portald, 81
- schedule, 8010
- radadmn, 8011
- emerdap, 8012
- syslogd, 8013
- eaadmn, 8014
- emernet, 8018
- radlogin, 8020
- possibly others
#######################################################################
======
2) Bug
======
For each HTTP POST request the configuration web server starts the
receiving of the client's data using a heap buffer which automatically
increases its size through realloc.
When the data received is major than the integer value specified in
Content-Length it stops the operation and places a NULL byte at the end
of the data for delimiting it.
The problem is that using a negative Content-Length value forces the
server to place this 0x00 byte in a location of the memory which goes
from heap\_buffer+http\_header+0x80000000 to
heap\_buffer+http\_header+0xffffffff allowing an attacker to crash the
server or placing this byte in a better location which could give him
other possibilities of attack.
