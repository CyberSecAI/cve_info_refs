    "Metadata": {
      "Content": "Multiple sources identify CVE-2008-5078 as a buffer overflow vulnerability in the epsf special escape handling of GNU enscript.",
      "Source": [
        "rhn.redhat.com_cc4329bf_20250126_011342.html",
        "bugzilla.redhat.com_9d8e4446_20250124_130316.html",

      ]
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `recognize_eps_file()` function within `src/psgen.c` and the `tilde_subst()` function in `src/util.c` of GNU enscript.",
      "Weaknesses": "The vulnerability arises from unsafe usage of `strcpy` or `sprintf` when handling long file names provided as arguments to the `epsf` special escape.",
      "Impact": "An attacker can craft a malicious ASCII file with an overly long filename in an epsf special escape sequence. When this file is processed by enscript with the special escapes option enabled, it leads to a buffer overflow. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.",
       "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted ASCII file is processed with enscript using the '-e' or '--escapes' option, and it includes a long filename within an epsf special escape.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a malicious ASCII file and have the target user process the file using enscript with the '-e' or '--escapes' option."
