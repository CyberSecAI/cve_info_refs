# RHSA-2008:1021 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: enscript security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A1021)

## Topic

An updated enscript packages that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

GNU enscript converts ASCII files to PostScript(R) language files and
spools the generated output to a specified printer or saves it to a file.
Enscript can be extended to handle different output media and includes
options for customizing printouts.

Several buffer overflow flaws were found in GNU enscript. An attacker could
craft an ASCII file in such a way that it could execute arbitrary commands
if the file was opened with enscript with the "special escapes" option (-e
or --escapes) enabled. (CVE-2008-3863, CVE-2008-4306, CVE-2008-5078)

All users of enscript should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=473958#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-12-01 16:21:50 UTC  ``` While preparing updates for [CVE-2008-3863](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-3863) and [CVE-2008-4306](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-4306), we have discovered that enscript 1.6.1 (and possibly earlier versions) is affected by similar flaws affecting handling of epsf special escape.  Long file name specified as an argument for epsf special escape can cause buffer overflow in recognize_eps_file() in src/psgen.c, or in tilde_subst() in src/util.c due to unsafe use of strcpy or sprintf.  Identified flaws do not affect enscript 1.6.4.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=473958#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-12-01 16:29:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 325251](attachment.cgi?id=325251&action=diff "Patch for enscript 1.6.1 for CVE-2008-3863, CVE-2008-4306 and CVE-2008-5078") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=325251&action=edit "Patch for enscript 1.6.1 for CVE-2008-3863, CVE-2008-4306 and CVE-2008-5078") Patch for enscript 1.6.1 for [CVE-2008-3863](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-3863), [CVE-2008-4306](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-4306) and [CVE-2008-5078](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-5078)  It also prevents few command line arguments parsing overflow, but those are not security flaws (no trust boundary crossed).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=473958#c3)  Adam Tkac    2008-12-04 15:51:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 325695](attachment.cgi?id=325695&action=diff "Improved patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=325695&action=edit "Improved patch") Improved patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=473958#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2008-12-15 13:39:11 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=473958#c5)  Red Hat Product Security    2008-12-19 17:39:29 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-1021.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=473958#c6)  Marcus Meissner    2009-02-20 10:58:00 UTC  ``` reading the manpage ... why not just pipe a shell command in @epsf{reboot|} ...   fixing just the buffer overflow is a bit stupid ;)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=473958#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2009-02-20 11:14:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=473958#c6)) > reading the manpage ... why not just pipe a shell command in @epsf{reboot|} ...   Because that is denied for quite a long time, at least in all RHEL and Fedora packages: <http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/rpms/enscript/devel/enscript-1.6.1-CAN-2004-1185.patch?view=markup>   ``` |  |

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- dhcp
By sending requests with a large value for 'dhcp-max-message-size'
dhcp-clients could crash dhcpd if dhcpd was configured with a large
amount of DHCP options (CVE-2007-0062).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- ntp/xntp
ntp didn't properly check the return value of the openssl function
EVP\_VerifyFinal (CVE-2009-0021).
Affected Products: SLES9, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
Packages for SLES10 got delayed due a fix for another problem and
will follow soon
- squid
A denial of service condition in HTTP-request processing
was fixed in squid (CVE-2009-0478).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1
- wireshark
wireshark could crash while reading capture files containing
NetScreen data (CVE-2009-0599), while reading Tektronix K12 capture
files (CVE-2009-0600) or if the HOME environment variable contained
format string specifiers (CVE-2009-0601).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libpng
Specially crafted png files could crash applications using libpng or
potentially execute arbitrary code by causing free of an
uninitialized pointer (CVE-2009-0040).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- pam\_mount
Temporary file handling of the passwdehd script was prone to symlink
attacks (CVE-2008-5138). In 11.0 and 11.1 the script was removed as
it doesn't work on those distributions anyways.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- enscript
long path names could overflow a buffer in enscript (CVE-2008-5078).
Affected Products: SLES9
- eID-belgium
eID-belgium didn't properly check the return value of the openssl
function EVP\_VerifyFinal (CVE-2009-0049).
Affected Products: SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- gstreamer-0\_10-plugins-good
Specially crafted QuickTime media files could cause heap based
buffer overflows in gstreamer. Attackers could potentially exploit
that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0386, CVE-2009-0387,
CVE-2009-0397).
Affected Products: SLES9, openSUSE 10.3-11.1

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

enscript security update (RHSA-2008-1021)

Original Release Date: December 17, 2008

Last Revised: December 17, 2008

Number: ASA-2008-504

Risk Level: None

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

GNU enscript converts ASCII files to PostScript(R) language files and
spools the generated output to a specified printer or saves it to a
file.
Several buffer overflow flaws were found in GNU enscript that will allow
an attacker to execute arbitrary
commands.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names
[CVE-2008-3863](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3863),
[CVE-2008-4306](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4306) and
[CVE-2008-5078](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5078) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat
Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-1021.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with enscript installed: None

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that
customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.
