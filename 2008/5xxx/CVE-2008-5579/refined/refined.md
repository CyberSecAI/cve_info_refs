Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-5579:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `mini-pub` application, specifically in how it handles the `sFileName` parameter in `img.php` and `cat.php`. This allows for the inclusion of arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `img.php` script is vulnerable to RFI by allowing a remote file to be specified in the `sFileName` parameter (e.g., `http://site.com/cmd.txt?`).
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `cat.php` script is vulnerable to LFI, allowing an attacker to access files from the server's file system (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
- **Command Execution:** The `cat.php` script also allows for command execution via the `sFileName` parameter (e.g., `a%3Benv`, which decodes to `a;env`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially revealing passwords, configuration files, and source code.
- **Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attacks are performed through crafted HTTP requests targeting the vulnerable `img.php` and `cat.php` scripts.
- **`sFileName` Parameter:** The `sFileName` parameter within the URLs is used to inject malicious file paths or commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:**  Based on the provided information, the vulnerabilities don't seem to require authentication. The attack is performed directly against the vulnerable scripts.

**Summary**
The `mini-pub 0.3` application has multiple vulnerabilities due to insecure handling of user input within the `sFileName` parameter. This allows an attacker to include remote or local files and execute commands.
