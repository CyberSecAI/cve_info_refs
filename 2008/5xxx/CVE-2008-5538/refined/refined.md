{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the antivirus software when handling HTML documents.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The antivirus software fails to properly detect malware in an HTML document when the document has an MZ header (indicating an executable file) and the file extension is either missing, .txt, or .jpg. This allows malicious HTML content to bypass the antivirus's scanning engine.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the user's system, including full confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts. Malware can be executed on the user's machine without detection.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can craft a malicious HTML document with a prepended MZ header and a misleading file extension, then host it on a web server. When a user accesses this page through Internet Explorer 6 or 7, the antivirus software fails to detect the malicious content, allowing it to be executed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious file on a web server and trick a user into accessing it via Internet Explorer 6 or 7."
