- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `export.php` script in ClaSS allows for local file inclusion due to insufficient sanitization of the `ftype` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive configuration files, database connection details (`dbh_connect.php`), and other PHP scripts, potentially leading to further compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `ftype` parameter in the URL, an attacker can specify a file path using directory traversal sequences (e.g., `/../../`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement, suggesting the vulnerability is likely exploitable by unauthenticated users.
