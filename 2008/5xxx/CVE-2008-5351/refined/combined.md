1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- MozillaFirefox/mozilla-xulrunner190
Firefox version upgrade to 3.0.9 to fix various security bugs.
(CVE-2009-1302,CVE-2009-1303,CVE-2009-1304,CVE-2009-1305,CVE-2009-1306,
CVE-2009-1307,CVE-2009-1308,CVE-2009-1309,CVE-2009-1310,CVE-2009-1311,
CVE-2009-1312,CVE-2009-0652)
Affected products: SLES 11, openSUSE 11.0-11.1
- apport
The apport crash watcher / handler suite contains a cron job that
cleanes the world writeable /var/crash directory unsafely, allowing
local attackers to remove random files on the system. (CVE-2009-1295)
This update fixes this.
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- evolution
camel's NTLM SASL authentication mechanism as used by evolution
did not properly validate server's challenge packets (CVE-2009-0582).

- Fixes creation of recurrence monthly items in GroupWise.
- Includes fixes for some usability issues.
Affected products: Novell Linux Desktop 9, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- freetype2
Freetype was updated to fix some integer overflows that can be exploited
remotely in conjunction with programs like a web-browser.
(CVE-2009-0946)
Thanks to Tavis Ormandy who found the bugs.
Affected products: SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- java-1\_4\_2-ibm/IBMJava2
This update brings IBM Java 1.4.2 to Service Release 13.
It fixes lots of bugs and following security issues:
CVE-2008-3104: Security vulnerabilities in the Java
Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet that is
loaded from a remote system to circumvent network access
restrictions and establish socket connections to certain
services running on the local host, as if it were loaded
from the system that the applet is running on. This may
allow the untrusted remote applet the ability to exploit
any security vulnerabilities existing in the services it
has connected to.
CVE-2008-3112: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create arbitrary files with the
permissions of the user running the untrusted Java Web
Start application.
CVE-2008-3113: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create or delete arbitrary files with
the permissions of the user running the untrusted Java
Web Start application.
CVE-2008-3114: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to
determine the location of the Java Web Start cache.
CVE-2008-5350: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted applet or
application to list the contents of the home directory of
the user running the applet or application.
CVE-2008-5346: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with parsing zip files may allow an
untrusted applet or application to read arbitrary memory
locations in the process that the applet or application is
running in.
CVE-2008-5343: A vulnerability in Java Web Start and Java
Plug-in may allow hidden code on a host to make network
connections to that host and to hijack HTTP sessions using
cookies stored in the browser.
CVE-2008-5344: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with applet classloading may allow an
untrusted applet to read arbitrary files on a system that
the applet runs on and make network connections to hosts
other than the host it was loaded from.
CVE-2008-5359: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) image processing code may allow
an untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges.
For example, an untrusted applet may grant itself
permissions to read and write local files or execute local
applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5339: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java Web Start
application to make network connections to hosts other than
the host that the application is downloaded from.
CVE-2008-5340: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with launching Java Web Start applications may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted application may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted application.
CVE-2008-5348: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with authenticating users through
Kerberos may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) to the
system as a whole, due to excessive consumption of
operating system resources.
CVE-2008-2086: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow
certain trusted operations to be performed, such as
modifying system properties.
CVE-2008-5345: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows
code loaded from the local filesystem to access localhost.
This may allow code that is maliciously placed on the local
filesystem and then subsequently run, to have network
access to localhost that would not otherwise be allowed if
the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be
leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for domains
that map a name to the localhost).
CVE-2008-5351: The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8)
decoder in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts
encodings that are longer than the "shortest" form. This
behavior is not a vulnerability in Java SE. However, it may
be leveraged to exploit systems running software that
relies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest form
sequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences may be
decoded into illegal URIs, which may then allow files that
are not otherwise accessible to be read, if the URIs are
not checked following UTF-8 decoding.
CVE-2008-5360: The Java Runtime Environment creates
temporary files with insufficiently random names. This may
be leveraged to write JAR files which may then be loaded as
untrusted applets and Java Web Start applications to access
and provide services from localhost and hence steal cookies.
CVE-2008-5353: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) related to deserializing calendar objects
may allow an untrusted applet or application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5356: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5354: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java
application that is launched through the command line to
escalate privileges. For example, the untrusted Java
application may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are
accessible to the user running the untrusted Java
application.
This vulnerability cannot be exploited by an applet or
Java Web Start application.
CVE-2008-5357: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5342: A security vulnerability in the the Java Web
Start BasicService allows untrusted applications that are
downloaded from another system to request local files to be
displayed by the browser of the user running the untrusted
application.
Affected products: SUSE CORE 9, SLE 10
- kdegraphics3
This update fixes security problems while decoding JBIG2.

CVE-2009-0799, CVE-2009-0800, CVE-2009-1179, CVE-2009-1180,
CVE-2009-1181, CVE-2009-1182, CVE-2009-1183)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libopenssl-devel/openssl/compat-openssl097g
This update of openssl fixes the following problems:
- CVE-2009-0590: ASN1\_STRING\_print\_ex() function allows remote denial
of service
- CVE-2009-0591: CMS\_verify() function allows signatures to look valid
- CVE-2009-0789: denial of service due to malformed ASN.1 structures
Affected products: SLES 9, SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libsoup
Large strings could lead to a heap overflow in the base64 encoding and
decoding functions. Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0585).
Affected products: Novell Linux Desktop 9, POS 9, OES, SLES 9, SLE 10
- opensc/libopensc2
Private data objects on smartcards initialized with OpenSC could be
accessed without authentication (CVE-2009-0368).
Only blank cards initialized with OpenSC are affected by this
problem. Affected cards need to be manually fixed, updating the
opensc package alone is not sufficient!
Please carefully read and follow the instructions on the following
web site if you are using PIN protected private data objects on
smart cards other than Oberthur, and you have initialized those
cards using OpenSC:
<http://en.opensuse.org/Smart_Cards/Advisories>
Affected products: SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- python-crypto
Missing checks for the key length in the ARC2 module potentially allowed
attackers to crash applications using python-crypto or potentially even
cause execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0544).
Affected products: SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- unbound
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow in the
ldns\_rr\_new\_frm\_str\_internal()
function. This allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
DNS resource record (RR) with a long class field and possibly TTL field.
(CVE-2009-1086)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- xpdf
Specially crafted PDF files could lead to crashes, make the viewer
run into an infinite loop or potentially even allow execution of
arbitrary code.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Sun Java Updates for Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedOctober 05, 2016
Alert CodeTA08-340A

### Systems Affected

### Overview

Sun has released alerts to address multiple vulnerabilities affecting the Sun Java Runtime Environment. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows users to run [Java](http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/) applications in a browser or as standalone programs. Sun has released updates to the Java Runtime Environment software to address multiple vulnerabilities.

Sun released the following alerts to address these issues:

* [244986](https://blogs.oracle.com/sunsecurity/entry/sun_alert_244986_the_java) :   The Java Runtime Environment Creates Temporary Files That Have "Guessable" File Names
* [244987](https://blogs.oracle.com/sunsecurity/entry/sun_alert_244987_java_runtime) :   Java Runtime Environment (JRE) Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities in Processing Image Files and Fonts May Allow Applets or Java Web Start Applications to Elevate Their Privileges

### Solution

#### Apply an update from Sun

These issues are addressed in the following versions of the Sun Java Runtime Environment:

* JDK and JRE 6 Update 11
* JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 17
* SDK and JRE 1.4.2\_19
* SDK and JRE 1.3.1\_24

If you install the latest version of Java, older versions may remain installed on your computer. If you do not need these older versions, you can remove them by following Sun's [instructions](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/5000010800.xml).

#### Disable Java

Disable Java in your web browser, as described in the [Securing Your Web Browser](/reading_room/securing_browser/) document. While this does not fix the underlying vulnerabilities, it does block a common attack vector.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Background

The Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Sun Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the Sun Java platform.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in the Sun Java
implementation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below and
the associated Sun Alerts for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted JAR
archive, applet, or Java Web Start application, possibly resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. Furthermore, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of
Service affecting multiple services via several vectors, disclose
information and memory contents, write or execute local files, conduct
session hijacking attacks via GIFAR files, steal cookies, bypass the
same-origin policy, load untrusted JAR files, establish network
connections to arbitrary hosts and posts via several vectors, modify
the list of supported graphics configurations, bypass HMAC-based
authentication systems, escalate privileges via several vectors and
cause applet code to be executed with older, possibly vulnerable
versions of the JRE.

NOTE: Some vulnerabilities require a trusted environment, user
interaction, a DNS Man-in-the-Middle or Cross-Site-Scripting attack.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Sun JRE 1.5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.5.0.22"
```

All Sun JRE 1.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.6.0.17"
```

All Sun JDK 1.5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.5.0.22"
```

All Sun JDK 1.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.6.0.17"
```

All users of the precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.5.x should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.5.0.22"
```

All users of the precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.6.x should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.6.0.17"
```

All Sun JRE 1.4.x, Sun JDK 1.4.x, Blackdown JRE, Blackdown JDK and
precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.4.x users are strongly advised to unmerge
Java 1.4:

```
 # emerge --unmerge =app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge =dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge =dev-java/sun-jdk-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge dev-java/blackdown-jdk
 # emerge --unmerge dev-java/blackdown-jre
```

Gentoo is ceasing support for the 1.4 generation of the Sun Java
Platform in accordance with upstream. All 1.4 JRE and JDK versions are
masked and will be removed shortly.

(JRE) with parsing zip files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to read arbitrary memory locations in the process that
the applet or application is running in.
CVE-2008-5343: A vulnerability in Java Web Start and Java Plug-in may
allow hidden code on a host to make network connections to that host
and to hijack HTTP sessions using cookies stored in the browser.
CVE-2008-5344: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) with applet classloading may allow an untrusted applet to read
arbitrary files on a system that the applet runs on and make network
connections to hosts other than the host it was loaded from.
CVE-2008-5359: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) image processing code may allow an untrusted applet
or application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5339: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
may allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to make network
connections to hosts other than the host that the application is
downloaded from.
CVE-2008-5340: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with
launching Java Web Start applications may allow an untrusted Java Web
Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
application may grant itself permissions to read and write local
files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user
running the untrusted application.
CVE-2008-5348: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) with authenticating users through Kerberos may lead to a Denial
of Service (DoS) to the system as a whole, due to excessive consumption
of operating system resources.
CVE-2008-2086: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow certain
trusted operations to be performed, such as modifying system
properties.
CVE-2008-5345: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows code loaded
from the local filesystem to access localhost. This may allow code that
is maliciously placed on the local filesystem and then subsequently
run, to have network access to localhost that would not otherwise
be allowed if the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be
leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for domains that map
a name to the localhost).
CVE-2008-5351: The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8) decoder in
the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts encodings that are longer
than the "shortest" form. This behavior is not a vulnerability in Java
SE. However, it may be leveraged to exploit systems running software
that relies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest form
sequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences may be decoded
into illegal URIs, which may then allow files that are not otherwise
accessible to be read, if the URIs are not checked following UTF-8
decoding.
CVE-2008-5360: The Java Runtime Environment creates temporary files
with insufficiently random names. This may be leveraged to write JAR
files which may then be loaded as untrusted applets and Java Web Start
applications to access and provide services from localhost and hence
steal cookies.
CVE-2008-5353: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) related to deserializing calendar objects may allow an untrusted
applet or application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5356: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) with processing fonts may allow an untrusted applet or Java Web
Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5354: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java application that is
launched through the command line to escalate privileges. For example,
the untrusted Java application may grant itself permissions to read
and write local files or execute local applications that are accessible
to the user running the untrusted Java application.
This vulnerability cannot be exploited by an applet or Java Web
Start application.
CVE-2008-5357: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) with processing fonts may allow an untrusted applet or Java Web
Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5342: A security vulnerability in the the Java Web Start
BasicService allows untrusted applications that are downloaded from
another system to request local files to be displayed by the browser
of the user running the untrusted application.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of programs using IBM Java after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The IBM Java JRE 5 was brought to Service Release 9 fixing quite a
number of security issues and bugs.
The update fixes the following security problems:
CVE-2008-5350: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) may allow an untrusted applet or application to list the contents
of the home directory of the user running the applet or application.
CVE-2008-5346: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) with parsing zip files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to read arbitrary memory locations in the process that
the applet or application is running in.
CVE-2008-5343: A vulnerability in Java Web Start and Java Plug-in may
allow hidden code on a host to make network connections to that host
and to hijack HTTP sessions using cookies stored in the browser.
CVE-2008-5344: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) with applet classloading may allow an untrusted applet to read
arbitrary files on a system that the applet runs on and make network
connections to hosts other than the host it was loaded from.
CVE-2008-5359: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) image processing code may allow an untrusted applet
or application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5341: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
may allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to determine the
location of the Java Web Start cache and the user name of the user
running the Java Web Start application.
CVE-2008-5339: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
may allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to make network
connections to hosts other than the host that the application is
downloaded from.
CVE-2008-5340: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with
launching Java Web Start applications may allow an untrusted Java Web
Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
application may grant itself permissions to read and write local
files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user
running the untrusted application.
CVE-2008-5348: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) with authenticating users through Kerberos may lead to a Denial
of Service (DoS) to the system as a whole, due to excessive consumption
of operating system resources.
CVE-2008-2086: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow certain
trusted operations to be performed, such as modifying system
properties.
CVE-2008-5345: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows code loaded
from the local filesystem to access localhost. This may allow code that
is maliciously placed on the local filesystem and then subsequently
run, to have network access to localhost that would not otherwise
be allowed if the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be
leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for domains that map
a name to the localhost).
CVE-2008-5351: The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8) decoder in
the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts encodings that are longer
than the "shortest" form. This behavior is not a vulnerability in Java
SE. However, it may be leveraged to exploit systems running software
that relies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest form
sequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences may be decoded
into illegal URIs, which may then allow files that are not otherwise
accessible to be read, if the URIs are not checked following UTF-8
decoding.
CVE-2008-5360: The Java Runtime Environment creates temporary files
with insufficiently random names. This may be leveraged to write JAR
files which may then be loaded as untrusted applets and Java Web Start
applications to access and provide services from localhost and hence
steal cookies.
CVE-2008-5353: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) related to deserializing calendar objects may allow an untrusted
applet or application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5356: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) with processing fonts may allow an untrusted applet or Java Web
Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5354: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java application that is
launched through the command line to escalate privileges. For example,
the untrusted Java application may grant itself permissions to read
and write local files or execute local applications that are accessible
to the user running the untrusted Java application.
This vulnerability cannot be exploited by an applet or Java Web
Start application.
CVE-2008-5357: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) with processing fonts may allow an untrusted applet or Java Web
Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5352: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) with unpacking applets and Java Web Start
applications using the "unpack200" JAR unpacking utility may allow an
untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges. For example,
an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are accessible to the
user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5342: A security vulnerability in the the Java Web Start
BasicService allows untrusted applications that are downloaded from
another system to request local files to be displayed by the browser
of the user running the untrusted application.

2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Make sure you restart all Java using applications after installing this update.
While letting them run will usually work, they for instance lose access to dynamically
loaded information like timezone data.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

No Avaya system products are vulnerable, as java-1.5.0-ibm is not
installed by default.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0016.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with java-1.5.0-ibm installed: None

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.

operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0466)

## Topic

Updated java-1.5.0-ibm packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Network Satellite Server.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

This update corrects several security vulnerabilities in the IBM Java 2
Runtime Environment and the IBM Java 2 Software Development Kit, shipped as
part of Red Hat Network Satellite Server. In a typical operating
environment, these are of low security risk as the runtime is not used on
untrusted applets.

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the IBM Java 2 Runtime
Environment and the IBM Java 2 Software Development Kit. These
vulnerabilities are summarized on the IBM "Security alerts" page listed in
the References section. (CVE-2008-3103, CVE-2008-5345, CVE-2008-5346,
CVE-2008-5348, CVE-2008-5349, CVE-2008-5350, CVE-2008-5351, CVE-2008-5352,
CVE-2008-5353, CVE-2008-5354, CVE-2008-5356, CVE-2008-5357, CVE-2008-5359,
CVE-2008-5360)

All users of java-1.5.0-ibm are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, containing the IBM 1.5.0 SR9 Java release. All running instances
of IBM Java must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- curl

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
