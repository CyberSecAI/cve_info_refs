  "cve": "CVE-2008-5351",
  "description": "The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8) decoder in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts encodings that are longer than the \"shortest\" form. This behavior is not a vulnerability in Java SE. However, it may be leveraged to exploit systems running software that relies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest form sequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences may be decoded into illegal URIs, which may then allow files that are not otherwise accessible to be read, if the URIs are not checked following UTF-8 decoding.",
  "affected_software": [
    "Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 10 and earlier",
    "JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 16 and earlier",
    "SDK and JRE 1.4.2_18 and earlier"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Java Runtime Environment's (JRE) UTF-8 decoder accepts encodings that are not the shortest form, allowing for multiple valid representations of the same character.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Non-canonical Encoding"
    ],
    "impact": "This vulnerability can be exploited if systems that rely on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest form sequences fail to validate the resulting decoded URI, potentially allowing access to files that would otherwise be inaccessible.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can craft non-shortest form UTF-8 encoded sequences, which are accepted by the vulnerable JRE UTF-8 decoder. If the decoded output is not properly validated by systems relying on this JRE UTF-8 decoder, it can lead to security breaches.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send/influence the UTF-8 encoded input that is then processed by the vulnerable JRE UTF-8 decoder. No additional specific capabilities or positions are specified."
  },
   "additional_notes": "This vulnerability exists in the way the JRE handles UTF-8 encoding, specifically regarding accepting non-shortest form encodings. This is not considered a vulnerability in Java SE itself, but it can be leveraged in systems that rely on the JRE decoder and don't do additional validation after decoding."
