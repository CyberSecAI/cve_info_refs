Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5774:

**Verification:**

*   The provided content from exploit-db.com explicitly mentions "CVE: 2008-5774" and provides exploit details. This confirms the content is related to the CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `iType` and `iPro` parameters used in the ASPSiteWare Home Builder application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize these parameters before using them in SQL queries.

*   **Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is SQL injection. The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `iType` and `iPro` parameters, which are directly embedded in SQL queries without proper sanitization.

*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability could lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers could extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials (`users` table is explicitly mentioned in the exploit example).
    *   **Data Modification:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Complete Compromise:** In some cases, SQL injection can be used to gain control over the underlying server, leading to a complete compromise of the application and potentially the host system.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vectors are the HTTP GET requests sent to the application with the vulnerable parameters. Specifically:
    *   `http://www.aspsiteware.com/Home1/type.asp?iType=[SQL Injection Payload]`
    *   `http://www.aspsiteware.com/home2/home2/detail.asp?iPro=[SQL Injection Payload]`
    *   `http://www.aspsiteware.com/home2/home2/type2.asp?iType=[SQL Injection Payload]`

*  **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
    *   The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL to craft the malicious injection.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit examples provided in exploit-db.com demonstrate how to use `UNION SELECT` to extract data from the `users` table.
*   The affected versions are explicitly stated as "Home Builder V1.0 / V2.0".
*   The vulnerability is present in multiple .asp files within the application: `type.asp`, `detail.asp`, and `type2.asp`.

**Summary**
The ASPSiteWare Home Builder 1.0/2.0 application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `iType` and `iPro` parameters, which could allow attackers to exfiltrate, modify, or delete sensitive information from the database and gain access to the underlying server. The attack vector is sending a malicious HTTP request with a crafted payload.
