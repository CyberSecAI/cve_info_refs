Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `id` parameter of the AlstraSoft Web Email Script Enterprise.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including admin login credentials (admin\_login, admin\_password), as demonstrated in the exploit example provided.
*   **Data Manipulation:** While not explicitly stated, SQL injection vulnerabilities often allow for modification or deletion of data, which could lead to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the application, specifically targeting the vulnerable `index.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not require any prior authentication, making it readily exploitable.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable `id` parameter within the application's URL structure.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the `partners_admin` table.
*   The `concat_ws` function is used to combine the admin\_login and admin\_password fields with a colon separator (0x3a).
*   The provided example URL is: `http://web.xxx /Script/ index.php?Act=directory&joinstatus=awesewise&id=-1+union+select+1,2,3,concat_ws(0x3a,admin_login,admin_password),5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45+from+partners_admin`
