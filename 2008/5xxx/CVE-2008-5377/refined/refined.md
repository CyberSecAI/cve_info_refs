{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The CUPS pstopdf filter creates a temporary log file at `/tmp/pstopdf.log`. This file is vulnerable to symlink attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the insecure creation of a temporary log file by the `pstopdf` filter in CUPS. Specifically, the filter does not properly check if /tmp/pstopdf.log already exists. An attacker can create a symbolic link to `/etc/ld.so.preload` at `/tmp/pstopdf.log`, thus redirecting the log output to `/etc/ld.so.preload`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "By controlling the content appended to `/etc/ld.so.preload`, an attacker can force the dynamic linker to load a malicious shared library when a privileged program is executed. This allows for arbitrary code execution with root privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local. The attacker needs to create a specially crafted postscript file that triggers an error in the `pstopdf` filter, causing it to write a malicious path into the log file. Additionally, the attacker must be able to create a symlink at `/tmp/pstopdf.log` and have a printer using the vulnerable filter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires local access to the system, the ability to create symbolic links, and have a printer using the vulnerable `pstopdf` filter. Also, `/etc/ld.so.preload` must be world readable, and CUPS must execute external filters as a privileged user."
