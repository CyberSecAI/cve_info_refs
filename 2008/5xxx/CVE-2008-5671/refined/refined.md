Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5671:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Joomla! versions 1.0.13 and 1.0.14 handle the `RG_EMULATION` setting, particularly during upgrades from older versions. The `globals.php` file, responsible for emulating `register_globals` functionality, includes the `configuration.php` file *before* calling the `registerGlobals()` function. If the `RG_EMULATION` constant is not defined in `configuration.php` (which occurs when upgrading from older versions), `globals.php` will set `RG_EMULATION` to true by default. However, because `configuration.php` is included before this check, a malicious actor can use GET variables to overwrite configurations before the `registerGlobals` function is invoked. Additionally, due to the use of `require_once`, `configuration.php` is not included again in `index.php`, leaving the attacker's overwritten values in place.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** By setting the `mosConfig_absolute_path` GET variable, an attacker can include a remote PHP script, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Improper Handling of `register_globals` Emulation:** The logic in `globals.php` to handle the `RG_EMULATION` setting is flawed, as it allows a malicious actor to inject and override crucial configuration values.
*   **Order of Includes:** The inclusion order in `globals.php` and the use of `require_once` in `index.php` cause the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the application and possibly the server itself.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can use the code execution capability to gain access to sensitive data and perform other malicious activities.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the website content.
*   **Denial of Service:** In some cases, remote code execution could be used for denial of service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vector is through maliciously crafted HTTP GET requests, specifically by setting the `mosConfig_absolute_path` variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to have remote access to the web application and knowledge of the vulnerable parameter `mosConfig_absolute_path`.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **PHP Configuration:** For the exploit to work, `register_globals` must be set to 'off' in `php.ini`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Joomla! versions 1.0.13 and 1.0.14.
*   Upgrading from older versions without updating the `configuration.php` file is the primary cause for the presence of the vulnerability.
*   The fix involves updating the `configuration.php` file to define `RG_EMULATION` as `0` or using the `configuration.php-dist` file.
*   A workaround is to change `require_once` to `require` for `configuration.php` in `index.php` and `administrator/index.php`.
*  Joomla! 1.0.15 addressed the issue.
