How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#### Description

This JIRA addresses the following security vulnerabilities in the web admin console:

CVE-2008-5518: Apache Geronimo web administration console directory traversal vulnerabilities.

A vulnerability was found in several portlets including Services/Repository, Embedded DB/DB Manager, and Security/Keystores when running the Apache Geronimo server on Windows. This issue may allow a remote attacker to upload any file in any directory. This affects all full JavaEE Geronimo assemblies or other distributions which include the administration web console up to and including Apache Geronimo 2.1.3. An alternative workaround (if you choose to not upgrade to Apache Geronimo 2.1.4) would be to stop or undeploy the administration web console application in the server.

Credit: The Apache Geronimo project would like to thank Digital Security Research Group (dsecrg.com) for responsibly reporting this issue and assisting us with validating our fixes.

CVE-2009-0038: Apache Geronimo web administration console XSS vulnerabilities

Various linked and stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were found in the Apache Geronimo administrative console and related utilities. Using this vulnerability an attacker can steal an administrator's cookie and then authenticate as administrator or perform certain administrative actions. For example, a user can inject XSS in some URLs or in several input fields in various portlets. This affects all full JavaEE Geronimo assemblies or other distributions which include the administration web console up to and including Apache Geronimo 2.1.3. An alternative workaround (if you choose to not upgrade to Apache Geronimo 2.1.4) would be to stop or undeploy the administration web console application in the server.

Credit: The Apache Geronimo project would like to thank Digital Security Research Group (dsecrg.com) and Marc Schoenefeld (Red Hat Security Response Team) for responsibly reporting this issue and assisting us with validating our fixes.

CVE-2009-0039: Apache Geronimo web administration console XSRF vulnerabilities

Various cross-site request forgery (XSRF or CSRF) vulnerabilities were identified in the Apache Geronimo web administration console. Exploiting these issues may allow a remote attacker to perform certain administrative actions, e.g. change web administration password, upload applications, etc... using predictable URL requests once the user has authenticated and obtained a valid session with the server. This affects all full JavaEE Geronimo assemblies or other distributions which include the administration web console up to and including Apache Geronimo 2.1.3. An alternative workaround (if you choose to not upgrade to Apache Geronimo 2.1.4) would be to stop or undeploy the administration web console application in the server.

Credit: The Apache Geronimo project would like to thank Digital Security Research Group (dsecrg.com) for responsibly reporting this issue and assisting us with validating our fixes.

It corrects the issues with the addition of directory checks and a servlet filter to check for XSS and XSRF vulnerabilities

Geronimo Server:CVE-2010-2227: Apache Tomcat Remote Denial Of Service and Information Disclosure Vulnerability The Tomcat web container contains a vulnerability that may expose the Geronimo server to remote denial of service attacks and potentially disclose information about applications running on the Geronimo server. Details of this vulnerability can be found here:   * <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2227>   An alternative workaround, if you choose not to upgrade to Apache Geronimo 2.1.7, is to manually patch the server with the updated version of the Tomcat. Instructions for patching an existing release can be found here:   * [Geronimo Geronimo 2.1.x and 2.2.x CVE-2010-2227 Apache Tomcat Remote Denial of Service Patch Instructions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GMOxSITE/Geronimo%2B2.1.x%2Band%2B2.2.x%2BCVE-2010-2227%2BApache%2BTomcat%2BRemote%2BDenial%2BOf%2BService%2BPatch%2BInstructions)   JIRA: [GERONIMO-5387](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-5533) Affects: 2.1.1-2.1.6   Fixed in Geronimo 2.1.6  Please visit the [2.1.6 Release Notes](http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GMOxDOC21/RELEASE-NOTES-2.1.6.TXT) page for details on all of the included JIRAs. Geronimo Server:CVE-2010-1632 and CVE-2010-2076: Axis2 and CXF HTTP binding enables DTD based XML attacks. A vulnerability was found in both the Axis2 and CXF web services runtime that can allow an attacker to determine the presence of files on a target server and potentially extract the content of the target files. This affects all Geronimo assemblies that include the Axis2 or CXF runtimes, in particular, the javaee5 Jetty and Tomcat assemblies. Details of the vulnerabilities can be found in the following Axis2 and CXF security alerts:   * <https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/axis/axis2/java/core/security/CVE-2010-1632.pdf> * <https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/trunk/security/CVE-2010-2076.pdf>   The Apache Geronimo 2.1.6 release includes patches to Axis2 1.3 and Axiom 1.2.5 and an upgrade to CXF 2.1.13.  An alternative workaround, if you choose not to upgrade to Apache Geronimo 2.1.6, is to disable the web services runtime or manually patch the server with updated versions of the runtime. Instructions for disabling the web services runtime or patching an existing release can be found here:   * [Geronimo 2.1.x CVE-2010-1632 Patch Instructions](geronimo-21x-cve-2010-1632-patch-instructions.html)   JIRA: [GERONIMO-5383](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-5383) Affects: 2.1-2.1.5 Geronimo Server:CVE-2010-1622: Spring Framework execution of arbitrary code The Spring Framework provides a mechanism to use client provided data to update the properties of an object. This mechanism allows an attacker to modify the properties of the class loader used to load the object (via 'class.classloader'). This can lead to arbitrary command execution since, for example, an attacker can modify the URLs used by the class loader to point to locations controlled by the attacker. Details of this vulnerability can be found here:   * <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/511877/30/0/threaded>   The Apache Geronimo 2.1.6 release includes an upgrade to Spring Framework v2.5.6.SEC02.  At the current time, there are no known exposures in the Geronimo server due to this exploit, but applications using the included version of the Spring Framework may be vulnerable. An alternative workaround, if you choose not to upgrade to Apache Geronimo 2.1.6, is to manually patch the server with the updated version of the Spring Framework. Instructions for patching an existing release can be found here:   * [Geronimo Geronimo 2.1.x and 2.2.x Spring Framework SEC02 Patch Instructions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GMOxSITE/Geronimo%2B2.1.x%2Band%2B2.2.x%2BSpring%2BFramework%2BSEC02%2BPatch%2BInstructions)   JIRA: [GERONIMO-5387](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-5387) Affects: 2.1-2.1.5 Fixed in Geronimo 2.1.5  Please visit the [2.1.5 Release Notes](http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GMOxDOC21/RELEASE-NOTES-2.1.5.TXT) page for details on all of the included JIRAs. Fixed in Geronimo 2.1.4  Please visit the [2.1.4 Release Notes](http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GMOxDOC21/RELEASE-NOTES-2.1.4.TXT) page for details on all of the included JIRAs. Geronimo Server Included patch to close potential denial of service attack vector (OOM) in Tomcat session handling  JIRA: [GERONIMO-3838](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-3838) Affects: 2.1-2.1.3 Geronimo Admin Console:CVE-2008-5518: Apache Geronimo web administration console directory traversal vulnerabilities. A vulnerability was found in several portlets including Services/Repository, Embedded DB/DB Manager, and Security/Keystores when running the Apache Geronimo server on Windows. This issue may allow a remote attacker to upload any file in any directory. This affects all full JavaEE Geronimo assemblies or other distributions which include the administration web console up to and including Apache Geronimo 2.1.3. An alternative workaround (if you choose to not upgrade to Apache Geronimo 2.1.4) would be to stop or undeploy the administration web console application in the server. Credit: The Apache Geronimo project would like to thank Digital Security Research Group (dsecrg.com) for responsibly reporting this issue and assisting us with validating our fixes.  JIRA: [GERONIMO-4597](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-4597) Affects: 2.1-2.1.3 CVE-2009-0038: Apache Geronimo web administration console XSS vulnerabilities Various linked and stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were found in the Apache Geronimo administrative console and related utilities. Using this vulnerability an attacker can steal an administrator's cookie and then authenticate as administrator or perform certain administrative actions. For example, a user can inject XSS in some URLs or in several input fields in various portlets. This affects all full JavaEE Geronimo assemblies or other distributions which include the administration web console up to and including Apache Geronimo 2.1.3. An alternative workaround (if you choose to not upgrade to Apache Geronimo 2.1.4) would be to stop or undeploy the administration web console application in the server. Credit: The Apache Geronimo project would like to thank Digital Security Research Group (dsecrg.com) and Marc Schoenefeld (Red Hat Security Response Team) for responsibly reporting this issue and assisting us with validating our fixes.  JIRA: [GERONIMO-4597](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-4597) Affects: 2.1-2.1.3 CVE-2009-0039: Apache Geronimo web administration console XSRF vulnerabilities Various cross-site request forgery (XSRF or CSRF) vulnerabilities were identified in the Apache Geronimo web administration console. Exploiting these issues may allow a remote attacker to perform certain administrative actions, e.g. change web administration password, upload applications, etc... using predictable URL requests once the user has authenticated and obtained a valid session with the server. This affects all full JavaEE Geronimo assemblies or other distributions which include the administration web console up to and including Apache Geronimo 2.1.3. An alternative workaround (if you choose to not upgrade to Apache Geronimo 2.1.4) would be to stop or undeploy the administration web console application in the server.

Description
***********

Geronimo Server Console multiple Directory Traversal vulnerabilities.

A vulnerability was found in several portlets including Services/Repository, Embedded
DB/DB Manager, and Security/Keystores when running on a Windows server.  This issue may
allow a remote attacker to upload any file in any directory.

This affects all full JavaEE Geronimo releases or other distributions which include the
administration web console up to and including Geronimo 2.1.3.

Details
*******

1. Directory Traversal vulnerability found in script /console/portal//Services/Repository

Vulnerable parameters: "group", "artifact", "version", "fileType".

This issue may allow attacker to upload any file to any directory at remote server.

2. Directory Traversal vulnerability found in script /console/portal/Embedded DB/DB Manager

Vulnerable parameter "createDB".

3. Directory Traversal vulnerability found in script

/console/portal//Security/Keystores/__pm0x3console-base0x2Keystores!824133314|0_view/__rp0x3console-base0x2Keystores!824133314|0_mode/createKeystore

Vulnerable parameter "filename".

Solution
********

This security vulnerabilities fixed in Geronimo 2.1.4 release.

New version of Geronimo 2.1.4 can be downloaded from this location:

http://geronimo.apache.org/downloads.html

An alternative workaround (if you choose to not upgrade to Apache Geronimo 2.1.4) would
be to stop or undeploy the administration web console application in the server.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
