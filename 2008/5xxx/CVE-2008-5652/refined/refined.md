Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-5652

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the authentication mechanism of MyioSoft EasyBookMarker 4.0. The application does not properly sanitize user input when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to manipulate the login process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization in the login form, making the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This can lead to authentication bypass, as well as other potential database manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Authentication Bypass: An attacker can bypass the login process and gain unauthorized administrative access to the application by injecting SQL into the username field.
- Potential for Further Exploitation: Successful SQL injection can allow attackers to retrieve sensitive data from the database, modify data, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the server in some scenarios.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web Application: The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the application's login page.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is needed.
- The attacker needs to know a valid username. The exploit provides an example to bypass this, but the attacker must have some idea of a valid username.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker uses a specially crafted username like `[real_admin_name] ' or ' 1=1` to bypass authentication. The `' or ' 1=1` part will always evaluate to true, granting access to the user.
- The password is not checked in this exploit, meaning the password can be anything.
- The exploit details provide a demo login with credentials `admin: demo1 ' or ' 1=1` and `passwd: ZoRLu`

**Additional Notes:**
- The content explicitly mentions that knowing an admin username is required. However, the SQL injection bypasses the password check.
-  The exploit was published on milw0rm.com (now defunct) and is also found on exploit-db.com.
- The provided links to the NVD for CVE-2008-5655 and CVE-2008-5652 point to the same vulnerability. It's possible they are both assigned to the same issue, or that CVE-2008-5655 is a duplicate or related to the same exploit.
