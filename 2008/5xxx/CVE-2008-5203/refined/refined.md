{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The LFI vulnerability is due to the `lang` parameter in multiple PHP files not being properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files. The XSS vulnerability occurs in `external_vote.php` via the `l_vote_done` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain system access through LFI and execute arbitrary code by including files on the server. XSS allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the user's browser.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "LFI: Sending a crafted request with the `lang` parameter in the URL of multiple PHP files to include a malicious local file.",
    "XSS: Sending a crafted request to `external_vote.php` with the `l_vote_done` parameter containing malicious JavaScript code."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No other special requirements are specified."
