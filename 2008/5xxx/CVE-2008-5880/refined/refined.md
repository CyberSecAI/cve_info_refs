```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses an insecure cookie handling mechanism in `admin/auth.php`. After successful authentication, it sets a cookie named "auth" with the value "ok" without sufficient security measures.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure cookie handling. The application sets a simple cookie ("auth=ok") upon login, which can be easily manipulated by an attacker. The cookie is not protected against tampering, replay attacks, or unauthorized access.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can bypass the authentication by manually setting the "auth" cookie to "ok" via JavaScript or other methods. This allows unauthorized access to the administrative functionalities.
- Attack vectors: The attacker can use a client-side script (e.g., JavaScript) to set the cookie in the browser. After that, they can access the admin area.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have access to the client's browser and knowledge of the cookie name and value required for authentication bypass.
