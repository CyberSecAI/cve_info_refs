Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `calendar.php` script includes a file specified by the `$lang` variable without proper sanitization. This variable's value is taken directly from the GET request, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** User registration information, including usernames and password hashes, are stored in a plain text file (`usr.txt`) accessible through a direct web request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The `$lang` variable in `calendar.php` is not sanitized, enabling the inclusion of remote files.
*   **Insecure Storage:** User data is stored in a plain text file, exposing sensitive information.
*   **Lack of Variable Initialization:** The `$lang` variable is used before being assigned a value, making it controllable by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Through the RFI vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote script.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can directly access the `usr.txt` file and obtain usernames and password hashes.
*   **Complete Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability**: The CVSS score indicates complete impact on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability, likely due to the ability to achieve Remote Code Execution and the disclosure of user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The RFI vulnerability is exploited by sending a GET request to the `calendar.php` script with a crafted `lang` parameter (`/[path]/calendar.php?lang=[remote_txt_shell]`).
*   **Direct URL Access:** The sensitive data disclosure vulnerability is exploited by directly accessing the `usr.txt` file (`/[path]/data/usr.txt`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be located anywhere with network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to send HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**
* The identified vulnerable software is WorkSimple version 1.2.1
* The vulnerability is present in `calendar.php`
* A suggested fix for the RFI is to declare `$lang` in `data/conf.php`, which prevents the attacker from injecting remote URLs.
* The identified CWE is CWE-94, which corresponds to "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
* The vendor of the affected software is not listed in the provided content.
