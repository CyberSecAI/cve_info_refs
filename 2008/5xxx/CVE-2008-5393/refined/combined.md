The 3ware-controller is identified by the system as a SCSI-controller, even if (S)-ATA-Disks are used.

The Documentation on our website sais: "Attention: this does not apply to SCSI hard disk, because the SCSI subsystem is also needed for working with usb drives. SCSI disks are very rare in desktop systems these days."

But the problem with "real" raidcontrollers (not low-budget onboard promise-controllers or similar - they should be identified als IDE-Device and be ignored as a normal ATA-disk anyway) should be solvable: We just made a new Kernel without support for

\* all SCSI/IDE/SATA/SAS RAID-controllers

\* iSCSI HBAs

\* Fibre Chanell Controller

... and some more. This kernel should ignore your RAID.

As soon as the new Kernel is tested, we will release it with UPR 8.04\_rc10

Thanks for helping us to improve UPR.
