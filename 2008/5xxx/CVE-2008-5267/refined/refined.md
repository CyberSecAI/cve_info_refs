Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5267:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `answer.php` script of the Experts application, version 1.0.0.
*   The script is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `question_id` parameter.
*   Specifically, the `question_id` parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs when user-supplied data is embedded into an SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `question_id` parameter before using it in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can potentially access sensitive information stored in the database, including administrator login credentials (username and password).
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data stored in the database, depending on the database privileges.
*   **Account Takeover:**  Retrieving administrator login credentials allows an attacker to gain full control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request.
*   **`question_id` parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `question_id` parameter of the `answer.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely via a web browser.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to construct HTTP GET requests.
*   **Knowledge of SQL Syntax:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is on lines 70-74 of the `answer.php` script:

    ```php
    70:	FROM question
    71:	INNER JOIN (user,category, expert)
    72:	ON (question_user=user_id
    73:	AND question_category=category_id AND question_expert=expert_id )
    74:	WHERE question_id=".$question_id;
    ```

*   The provided exploit example is:

    `http://[Target]/[experts_path]/answer.php?question_id=41 AND 1=2 UNION SELECT concat(administrator_login,0x3a,administrator_password),2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 FROM administrator`

    *   This exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve the administrator's login and password from the `administrator` table.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit assumes that `magic_quotes_gpc` is turned off.
*   The Exploit-DB entry provides a clear exploit path and details the vulnerable code.
