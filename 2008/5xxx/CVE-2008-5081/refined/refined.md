    "Metadata": {
      "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
      "ID": "CVE-2008-5081"
    },
    "Security Information": {
      "Root cause": "Improper input validation when processing mDNS packets.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "The Avahi daemon does not properly verify its input when processing mDNS packets, leading to an assertion failure."
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted mDNS packet.",
      "Attack vector": "Sending a specially crafted mDNS packet over the network.",
      "Required capabilities": "Ability to send network packets."
    },
       "Additional Information":{
         "Affected Versions": "Avahi versions prior to 0.6.24 are affected.",
        "Specific details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `originates_from_local_legacy_unicast_socket()` function within `avahi-core/server.c` when an mDNS packet with a source port of 0 is encountered, leading to an assertion failure. This causes the avahi-daemon to abort.",
         "Affected Operating Systems": [
              "Ubuntu 8.10",
              "Ubuntu 8.04",

               "Debian etch",
              "openSUSE 10.3-11.1"
            ],
         "Mitigation": "Upgrade to Avahi version 0.6.24 or later.",
         "Exploit": "An exploit is available at Exploit Database (EDB-ID 7520), which demonstrates how to craft and send a malicious mDNS packet to trigger the vulnerability."
