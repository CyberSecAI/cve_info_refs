Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5169:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `drinkid` parameter of the `drink.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user input provided through the `drinkid` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including administrator login credentials (`login` and `password` from the `admin_login` table) and member login credentials (`login` and `password` from the `users` table).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to `drink.php`, specifically manipulating the `drinkid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement in the `drinkid` parameter to inject malicious SQL.
-  The exploit examples provided are:
    - For admin info:  `www.site.me/patch/drinks/drink.php?drinkid=-99999+union+select+0,concat(login,0x3a,password)+from+admin_login/*`
    - For member info: `www.site.me/patch/drinks/drink.php?drinkid=-99999+union+select+0,concat(login,0x3a,password)+from+users/*`
    - These queries utilize `concat` to retrieve the login and password data in a single column output.
    - The `/*` comment is used to comment out any further SQL queries that may be part of the vulnerable application's logic, preventing errors.
