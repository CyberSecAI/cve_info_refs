Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-5515:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Tomcat's `RequestDispatcher` handles target paths when obtained from a `Request` object. Specifically, the target path was normalized before the query string was removed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Normalization Issue**: The premature normalization of the target path before query string removal allows for manipulation of the path by inserting characters that bypass security constraints.
*   **Incorrect RequestDispatcher Handling**: `RequestDispatcher` processing logic failed to properly handle specially crafted request parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access content that is normally protected, such as resources under the WEB-INF directory.
*   **Security Constraint Bypass:** Attackers can bypass security constraints defined for web applications, potentially gaining unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Request Parameters**: The attack vector is a request containing a manipulated request parameter designed to bypass access restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tomcat instance.
*   **Understanding of Target Application Structure**: The attacker needs some knowledge of the target applicationâ€™s structure and directory layout to construct effective malicious parameters.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of Apache Tomcat 4.1.0-4.1.39, 5.5.0-5.5.27 and 6.0.0 to 6.0.18.
*   The fix involves modifying the `RequestDispatcher` processing to correctly handle paths and remove query strings in the correct order.
*   Several sources mention this CVE, including JVN, RedHat and Fujitsu which indicate the vulnerability was widespread.
*   The vulnerability is also present in some Fujitsu Interstage Application Server products, which utilize Apache Tomcat as a servlet container, thus highlighting the broader impact of the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability allows access to files under the `WEB-INF` directory, which typically contains sensitive information.
*   The exploit can allow access to resources that should not be accessed directly such as JSPs.
