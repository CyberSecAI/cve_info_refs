{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly exposes its database files (.mdb) to the web, allowing unauthorized access.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Database disclosure. The lack of access control allows anyone to download the database files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Full access to the database, which could contain sensitive information such as user credentials, personal data, and application-specific data.",
  "Attack vectors": "Direct HTTP requests to the database files.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know the location of the database files or be able to find them (e.g., through directory listing or other means). No authentication or specific privileges are required."
