## CVE-2008-5966

This entry from Exploit Database describes a remote file rewriting vulnerability in Globsy version 1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `globsy_edit.php` script allows arbitrary file rewriting due to insufficient validation of the `$filename` and `$data` parameters. Specifically, the script uses `fopen($filename, "w")` to open the file specified by `$filename` in write mode and then writes the content of `$data` to it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unvalidated input:** The script does not properly validate the `$filename` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify any file on the server.
*   **Arbitrary file write:** The use of `"w"` mode in `fopen` allows overwriting existing files, potentially including sensitive system files or configuration files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can rewrite or create arbitrary files on the server.
*   This can lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting existing PHP files with malicious code or creating new PHP files containing malicious code.
*   An attacker could deface the website, gain complete control of the server, or steal sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a POST request to `globsy_edit.php` with the `mode` parameter set to `save`, the `file` parameter set to the target file, and the `data` parameter set to the desired content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server running Globsy.
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges.
