{
  "CVE-2008-5340": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with launching Java Web Start applications may allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted application may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user running the untrusted application.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists in how Java Web Start applications are launched within the Java Runtime Environment.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the launching mechanism for Java Web Start applications.",
      "Improper handling of trust boundaries when launching Java Web Start applications"
     ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the untrusted application. Specifically, they could grant themselves permissions to read and write local files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A user needs to visit a malicious website or open a malicious link that launches an untrusted Java Web Start application."
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "The attacker needs to host or distribute a malicious Java Web Start application.",
      "The attacker needs to convince a user to launch the malicious application through a website or direct link"
    ]
  }
