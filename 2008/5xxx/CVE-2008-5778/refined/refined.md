Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2008-5778:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `report.php` file of the Free Links Directory Script version 1.2a.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `linkid` parameter, passed via the GET method, is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization. Specifically, the line:
    ```php
    $linkinfo = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query("select * from links where id=$linkida"))
    ```
    is vulnerable because `$linkida` is not validated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can inject SQL code to retrieve sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords from the `users` table.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can lead to further database manipulation, potentially enabling the attacker to modify or delete data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user privileges, the attacker might be able to gain more control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted GET request to the `report.php` file, manipulating the `linkid` parameter.
*   **Cookie Required:** The exploit requires a specific cookie named `logged` with a value of `d0ml4bs`. This cookie bypasses the login check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know to target the `linkid` parameter in `report.php`.
*   **Bypass Login Check:**  The attacker needs to know to send a specific cookie.
*   **Basic SQL knowledge:** The attacker needs to know SQL injection syntax.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit code demonstrates the attack:
    ```perl
    my $req = HTTP::Request->new(GET => $host."report.php.php?linkid=-1/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/1,concat(0x5f5f5f5f,0x5b215d20757365723a20,username,0x20205b215d20706173733a20,password,0x5f5f5f5f),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11/**/FROM/**/users");
    ```
    This injects a SQL UNION statement that retrieves the `username` and `password` fields from the `users` table and displays them.

*   The exploit uses `LWP::UserAgent` in Perl to send the crafted HTTP request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS base score of 7.5, which is considered high.
*   The exploitability subscore is 10, which means the exploit is easy to execute remotely without authentication.
*   The impact subscore is 6.4, which means the exploit has partial confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
