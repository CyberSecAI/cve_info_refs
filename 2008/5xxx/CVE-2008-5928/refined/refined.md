Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5928:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `redir.php` script of the Free Links Directory Script (FLDS) version 1.2a.
*   The script directly incorporates the user-supplied `id` parameter from the URL into a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize or escape the user-provided input, making it susceptible to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, or other confidential data. The exploit demonstrates the retrieval of database version information.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **Loss of Integrity:** By manipulating data, the attacker can compromise the integrity of the application and its data.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can lead to other types of attacks like remote code execution depending on database privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `redir.php` script, specifically manipulating the `id` parameter.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:**  The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious payload, specifically UNION SELECT statements in this instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet from `redir.php` is:
    ```php
    $ida = $_GET['id'];
    $link = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query("select * from links where id=$ida"));
    $idcheck = mysql_numrows(mysql_query("select * from links where id=$ida"));
    ```
*   An example exploit URL is provided:
    `http://flds-script.com/demo/redir.php?id=-1%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,@@version,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11`
*   The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to inject the query and retrieve database version.
*   It's noted that attempts to comment out the rest of the query don't work as expected, but the data from injection is revealed in the URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Multiple sources confirm this SQL injection vulnerability.
*   The exploit was published in 2008.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
*   CVSS base score is 7.5/10, indicating a high severity vulnerability due to the ease of exploitability and potential impact.
*   The provided resources also include references to other vulnerability databases like SecurityFocus, milw0rm, and Secunia.
