  "CVE-2008-5134": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `lbs_process_bss` function within the libertas subsystem of the Linux kernel.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers could potentially have an unspecified impact due to the buffer overflow. This could lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution, although the provided information does not explicitly confirm code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted, invalid beacon or probe response, likely via a wireless network connection.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted wireless beacon or probe responses. This could require proximity to the target or a position to inject these responses into a wireless network."
