- The vulnerability can lead to reading portions of memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- Attackers could exploit this by crafting specially designed strings that trigger the vulnerability in the `mbstring` extension within PHP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- They need to be able to send specifically crafted strings to the affected PHP application.

**Affected software:**
- PHP versions prior to 5.2.9. Specifically, the vulnerability was addressed in PHP 5.2.9.
-  HP-UX running Apache-based Web Server and Tomcat-based Servelet Engine

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Hamid Ebadi of APA Laboratory.
- This vulnerability was fixed in PHP version 5.2.9.
- The SUSE Security Summary Report also acknowledges this vulnerability and mentions that a fix is available for multiple openSUSE and SLES versions.
