Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-5777:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `index.php` file of the CadeNix application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (`cid` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `cid` parameter is vulnerable to a SQL injection via a crafted `UNION SELECT` statement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including user names and passwords, potentially leading to the compromise of user accounts.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Once an attacker has access to the database, they can modify or delete data, potentially damaging the integrity of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the `cid` parameter in the URL.
- **URL Manipulation:** The `cid` parameter in the URL can be modified to include malicious SQL commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not require prior authentication to access and exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable URL: `http://site.com/demo/index.php?game=40664&cid=[SQL_Injection_Payload]`
- Example SQL Injection Payload: `-1+union+select+1,2,3,name,5,6,pass,8,9,10+from+members--`
- The attacker injects the SQL query with a UNION SELECT statement to pull information from the 'members' table.

This exploit allows an attacker to directly query the database, bypassing normal application logic, which could lead to extraction of passwords and other sensitive information.
