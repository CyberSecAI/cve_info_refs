1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

The client library could also crash when a rogue server unexpectedly
closes the connection (CVE-2008-5006).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- rsyslog
rsyslog ignored the $AllowedSender configuration directive,
therefore accepting log messages from anyone (CVE-2008-5617).
Additionally imudp logged a message when unauthorized senders tried
to send to it, therefore allowing attackers to flood the log
CVE-2008-5618).
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- courier-authlib
Insufficient quoting allowed attackers to inject SQL statements when
using the pgsql backend (CVE-2008-2380).

for IBM S/390 and IBM zSeries, SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8 for x86,
SLE 10 DEBUGINFO SP2, SLED 10 SP1, SLED 10 SP2, SLES 10 SP1, SLES 10 SP2
- python
Integer Overflows in the python imageop module and in the expandtabs method
potentially allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-4864,
CVE-2008-5031)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, Novell Linux Desktop 9, Novell Linux
POS 9, Open Enterprise Server, SLES 9, SLE SDK 10 SP2, SLED 10 SP2,
SLES 10 SP2
- jhead
An update of jhead fixes several security problems:
- CVE-2008-4575: buffer overflow in DoCommand()
- CVE-2008-4639: local symlink attack
- CVE-2008-4640: DoCommand() allowed deletion of arbitrary files
- CVE-2008-4641: execution of arbitrary shell commands in DoCommand()
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- git
Insufficient quoting of shell characters allowed remote attackers to
execute arbitrary commands via the git web interface (CVE-2008-5517)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3
- samba
This update of samba fixes a bug that allowed the client to retrieve
arbitrary memory content from the server process. (CVE-2008-4314)
Additionally another bug was fixed that affects environments that
enabled registry shares by setting "registry shares = yes". In this case
an authenticated user is accidently allowed to access the root file-
system "/". (CVE-2009-0022)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- vinagre
A format string problem in vinagre potentially allowed malicious VNC
servers to have a vinagre client that connects to the server execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-5660)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0-11.1
- opera
Opera 9.63 fixes the following security problems:
- Manipulating text input contents can allow execution of
arbitrary code
- HTML parsing flaw can cause Opera to execute arbitrary code.
- Long hostnames in file: URLs can cause execution of arbitrary
code.
- Script injection in feed preview can reveal contents of unrelated
news feeds.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Thank you!

Looks like they got texts mixed up.  -5516 was given to git_search
issue, and -5517 to git_snapshot and git_object issues (the idea was
to use lower id for the issue fixed earlier).  Btw, commitdiff links are
correct, only texts need swapping.

Can you also change "in 1.5.x" to "before 1.5.x" in both descriptions?
Wording in our BZ is probably confusing, but versions 1.5.5 and 1.5.6
are the first versions to include the fix, not the vulnerability.

I've looked into their source rpm, and this is from my previous mail:
  "They fixed both -5516 (git_search) and -5517 (git_snapshot and
  git_object) issues using quote_command() (in their
  git-1.5.2.4-24.4.src.rpm)."
  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/01/20/1>

> Same question to the rPath maintainers...

Their announcement mentions version 1.5.6.6, that should have both
issues fixed (and -5916).  They'll probably clarify what was their
"old" version.

Package        : git-core
Vulnerability  : shell command injection
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-5516 CVE-2008-5517
Debian Bug     : 512330

It was discovered that gitweb, the web interface for the Git version
control system, contained several vulnerabilities:

Remote attackers could use crafted requests to execute shell commands on
the web server, using the snapshot generation and pickaxe search
functionality (CVE-2008-5516).

Local users with write access to the configuration of a Git repository
served by gitweb could cause gitweb to execute arbitrary shell commands
with the permission of the web server (CVE-2008-5517).

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4.4-4+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) and testing distribution (lenny),
the remote shell command injection issuei (CVE-2008-5516) has been fixed
in version 1.5.6-1.  The other issue will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your Git packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# git: Multiple vulnerabilties — GLSA **200903-15**

Multiple vulnerabilities in gitweb allow for remote execution of arbitrary
commands.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-util/git** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.0.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.0.6** |

### Background

GIT - the stupid content tracker, the revision control system used by
the Linux kernel team.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in gitweb that is part of
the git package:

* Shell metacharacters related to git\_search are not properly sanitized
  (CVE-2008-5516).
* Shell metacharacters related to git\_snapshot and git\_object are not
  properly sanitized (CVE-2008-5517).
* The diff.external configuration variable as set in a repository can be
  executed by gitweb (CVE-2008-5916).

### Impact

A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands via
shell metacharacters in a query, remote attackers with write access to
a git repository configuration can execute arbitrary commands with the
privileges of the user running gitweb by modifying the diff.external
configuration variable in the repository and sending a crafted query to
gitweb.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All git users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/git-1.6.0.6"
```

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [git-core](/security/cves?package=git-core) -

## Details

It was discovered that Git did not properly handle long file paths. If a user

were tricked into performing commands on a specially crafted Git repository, an

attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-3546](/security/CVE-2008-3546))

It was discovered that the Git web interface (gitweb) did not correctly handle

shell metacharacters when processing certain commands. A remote attacker could

send specially crafted commands to the Git server and execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the Git web server. This issue only applied to Ubuntu

7.10 and 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-5516](/security/CVE-2008-5516), [CVE-2008-5517](/security/CVE-2008-5517))

It was discovered that the Git web interface (gitweb) did not properly restrict

the diff.external configuration parameter. A local attacker could exploit this

issue and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Git web server.

This issue only applied to Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and 8.10. ([CVE-2008-5916](/security/CVE-2008-5916))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=479715#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-12 16:48:12 UTC  ``` Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE security team discovered a remote command injection flaws in the gitweb, caused by an insufficient checking of the inputs used to build argument to perl's open() function.  Remote attacker could use these flaws to run arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web server executing gitweb CGI scripts.  Issues are already fixed upstream in the latest git branches.  It seems that the security consequences were not noticed when fixes were applied upstream, as multiple occurrences of the similar flaws were fixed in different upstream versions:  [CVE-2008-5517](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-5517)   <http://repo.or.cz/w/git.git?a=commitdiff;h=516381d5>   (fixes issues in git_snapshot and git_object, first occurred in 1.5.6)  [CVE-2008-5516](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-5516)   <http://repo.or.cz/w/git.git?a=commitdiff;h=c582abae>   (fixes issue in git_search, first occurred in 1.5.5)  All current Fedora packages use version 1.5.6+, so neither of the issue apply to them.  EPEL versions should be affected by one or both of the issues.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=479715#c1)  Todd Zullinger    2009-01-12 19:34:33 UTC  ``` Looking at this, am I correct that EL-4 isn't vulnerable to either of these since it includes git-1.5.4.7?  For EL-5, git is at 1.5.5.6, which includes c582abae.  So, we just need to add 516381d5 to correct [CVE-2008-5517](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-5517).  Sound right?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=479715#c2)  Todd Zullinger    2009-01-13 06:50:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=479715#c1)) > Looking at this, am I correct that EL-4 isn't vulnerable to either of these > since it includes git-1.5.4.7?  Sorry for being dense there.  I realized a bit later that 1.5.4.7 indeed was vulnerable to both issues.  (I read the "first occurred in ..." part as when the vulnerability first occurred, not when the commit which fixes it occurred.)  Are there testcases available to verify the fixes?  The commits from git.git require a little massaging to apply to 1.5.4.7, so checking that the issues are fixed would be good.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=479715#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-13 07:46:17 UTC  ``` Right, EPEL-4 should be affected by both, "first occurred in" was meant as "first fixed in".  I have not tried to find first affected version, it may go way back.  I do not have any ready to use test case, though based on comments in infrastructure ticket 1120, someone's been able to re-create one successfully.  As for EPEL-4 patch, it may be possible to address -5516 by using quote_command() (introduced in -5517 patch) on the open() argument.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=479715#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-13 12:47:54 UTC  ``` Smaller fix for -5516 was used in warthog9's tree (should be used on kernel.org):  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/warthog9/gitweb.git;a=commitdiff;h=bf17b83a>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=479715#c5)  Todd Zullinger    2009-01-13 15:09:57 UTC  ``` Thanks Tomas.  The patch that I had matched the upstream c582abae pretty well.

Subject: gitweb: do not run "git diff" that is Porcelain
Date: Mon, 19 Jan 2009 13:56:44 -0500
```
Package: gitweb
Version: 1.5.4
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

This bug report covers [CVE-2008-5517](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5517).

Now, correct me if I'm wrong, Gerrit, but this doesn't have anything to
do with shell metacharacters, despite what the CVE claims.

This actually relates to the ability to run an external diff command
(diff.external).  If Alice maintains a repo being hosted by Bob, she
could therefore trick gitweb into invoking any executable she chooses.
This is bad if gitweb is being run as a priviledged user, or if Alice is
not meant to have executing rights on the server.

This has been fixed in 1:1.6.0.6-1, already in experimental.  It has
also been fixed upstream in 1.5.6.6, although the patch[*] could be
cleanly applied to lenny's 1.5.6.5 as well.

[*] <<http://repo.or.cz/w/git.git?a=commitdiff;h=dfff4b7aa42de7e7d58caeebe2c6128449f09b76;hp=872354dcb3ce5f34f7ddb12d2c89d26a1ea4daf0>>

Support for diff.external was added in 1.5.4, so this bug does not apply
to sarge.

Nope, this is a different bug.  The diff.external issue hasn't
received a CVE yet, AFAIK.

Strange, the first two links of the mitre.org page seem to imply
otherwise.

Could you tell me where to find more information about this bug, then?
All my searches have turned up is the diff.external issue, and there
doesn't seem to be any bug report attached to this CVE.

Yes, and Novell's SRPM matches the bug distribution.  I would say,
let's use [CVE-2008-5517](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5517) for this issue.

> Could you tell me where to find more information about this bug, then?

There's another set of bugs, which has received [CVE-2008-5516](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5516) and was
silently fixed by upstream quite some time ago.

Good, looks better.

Plus one extraneous version change ;).  Description for -5516 is
supposed to say "before 1.5.5" (as 1.5.5.0, but upstream does not seem
to use trailing ".0"s in version strings) (I have not looked whether
only 1.5.x were affected by this, this may possibly go back to older
versions), one for -5517 should say "before 1.5.6".  Version difference
was the reason for split / assignment of 2 CVEs.

Paragraph above should explain this.  Additionally, they probably just
bumped to upstream version that has all three (-5516, -5517, and -5916)
issues fixed.  Not sure what was their previous version though.

No, they have not.  They fixed both -5516 (git_search) and -5517
(git_snapshot and git_object) issues using quote_command() (in their
git-1.5.2.4-24.4.src.rpm).  No idea why only one of the CVEs was
mentioned in the security report...  They don't seem to include any
patch for diff.external issue, or claim to have fixed it.

So -5517 is now really used to refer to two different issues...

With little further details in SuSE security report, I think the
description is quite appropriate - unspecified remote hole related to
shell metacharacters.  Adding the two repo.or.cz links was most likely
a guess, not a good one though.

Mitre was notified about this inconsistency in the -5517 description
and references.
