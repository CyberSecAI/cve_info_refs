{
  "CVE-2008-5005": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the dmail and tmail mail delivery utilities shipped with imap. If either of these utilities were used as a mail delivery agent, a remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to run arbitrary code as the targeted user by sending a specially-crafted mail message to the victim.",
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to an unbounded `strcpy` to a stack-based buffer in the `dmail` and `tmail` utilities when handling command-line arguments, specifically when processing overlong mailbox specifications (user+folder).",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code as the user running the `dmail` or `tmail` utilities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted email message with a long folder extension argument that is processed by dmail or tmail.",
      "Local privilege escalation if the program is running setuid root (though this was not the default setup in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send a crafted email to the vulnerable system. For remote exploitation, the attacker needs the MTA to pass a long string to tmail/dmail as a delivery agent. If the program is running with root privileges, they may achieve local privilege escalation. ",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by passing a very long string as an argument to `dmail` or `tmail`. The program attempts to copy this string to a temporary buffer without checking its length. The remote exploitation may be possible if Postfix is configured to use [dt]mail as mailbox_command along with recipient_delimiter being set to +."
