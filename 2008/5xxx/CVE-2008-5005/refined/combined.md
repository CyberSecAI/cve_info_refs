[Red Hat Product Errata](/errata)
RHSA-2009:0275 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2009-02-19
Updated:
2009-02-19
# RHSA-2009:0275 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: imap security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Updated imap packages to fix a security issue are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 3.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The imap package provides server daemons for both the IMAP (Internet
Message Access Protocol) and POP (Post Office Protocol) mail access protocols.

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the dmail and tmail mail delivery
utilities shipped with imap. If either of these utilities were used as a
mail delivery agent, a remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to
run arbitrary code as the targeted user by sending a specially-crafted mail
message to the victim. (CVE-2008-5005)

Users of imap should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to resolve this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-11-03 12:11:43 UTC  ``` UW-IMAP upstream developers released new upstream version - 2007d - that fixes security issue in dmail and tmail utilities.  Upstream announcement fails to detail those issue further.  References: <http://mailman2.u.washington.edu/pipermail/imap-uw/2008-October/002267.html> <http://mailman2.u.washington.edu/pipermail/imap-uw/2008-October/002268.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-11-03 12:15:17 UTC  ``` uw-imap as shipped with Fedora and EPEL was rebased to upstream version 2007d, updates should appear in stable repositories on the next push runs.  uw-imap is also shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3 (imap package).  Only Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 offers imap-utils subpackage with tmail and dmail utilities.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2008-11-03 12:16:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 322296](attachment.cgi?id=322296&action=diff "dmail 2007b -> 2007d diff") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=322296&action=edit "dmail 2007b -> 2007d diff") dmail 2007b -> 2007d diff  Fixes unbound strcpy to stack-based buffer.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2008-11-03 12:17:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 322297](attachment.cgi?id=322297&action=diff "tmail 2007b -> 2007d diff") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=322297&action=edit "tmail 2007b -> 2007d diff") tmail 2007b -> 2007d diff  Similar change to dmail change.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2008-11-03 13:41:00 UTC  ``` Further details from Pawel Salek:  It's a classical stack overflow that can be triggered by passing +VERYLONGSTRING as the argument to [dt]mail. The program attempts to copy the string to a temporary buffer without checking its length. This is only root exploit if the program is suid root. It is a remote exploit if the smtp delivery program passes the argument to tmail longer than 1024 characters (eg via $u variable in  define(`LOCAL_MAILER_ARGS', `tmail $u')dnl   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2008-11-03 13:48:54 UTC  ``` RFC 5321 defines that maximum length of the local part of the email address is 64 characters [1], but longer local parts seem to be accepted by MTAs.   [1] <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-4.5.3.1.1>  Sendmail restricts total length of the recipient email address to 255 characters, while buffer being overflow in [dt]mail has capacity for 1024 characters.  That seems to be the restriction mentioned in the upstream announcement that is preventing remote exploitation of the flaw.  However, Postfix is bit more permissive in this regard and it may be possible to trigger this issue if Postfix is configured to use [dt]mail as mailbox_command along with recipient_delimiter being set to +.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2008-11-03 15:42:08 UTC  ``` Bitsec security advisory for this issue:   <http://www.bitsec.com/en/rad/bsa-081103.txt>   <http://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&m=122572590212610&w=4>  PoC is expected to be published on 2008-11-10 at:   <http://www.bitsec.com/en/rad/bsa-081103.c>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c8)  Fedora Update System    2008-11-06 04:08:19 UTC  ``` uw-imap-2007d-1.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.

Package        : uw-imap
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows, null pointer dereference
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-5005 CVE-2008-5006

Two vulnerabilities have been found in uw-imap, an IMAP
implementation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

It was discovered that several buffer overflows can be triggered via a
long folder extension argument to the tmail or dmail program. This
could lead to arbitrary code execution (CVE-2008-5005).

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered by
a malicious response to the QUIT command leading to a denial of service
(CVE-2008-5006).

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2002edebian1-13.1+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 2007d~dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your uw-imap packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE request - uw-imap

Hi!

uw-imap upstream released new version 2007d on friday, announcing it as
security update fixing some issues in dmail and tmail utilities:

<http://mailman2.u.washington.edu/pipermail/imap-uw/2008-October/002267.html>
<http://mailman2.u.washington.edu/pipermail/imap-uw/2008-October/002268.html>

Further digging into this, the issue seem to be a buffer overflow
(strcpy) when handling command line arguments (overlong mailbox
specification when utility is called with user+folder argument). This
can have security implications in the setups where tmail is installed
setuid root (according to the resources I found, that's required in
certain configurations; dmail is not expected to run under different
user), or when one of the utilities is configured as deliver agent in
the MTA.

Some further info I managed to collect is in our BZ:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=469667>

imap security update (RHSA-2009-0275)

Original Release Date: February 20, 2009

Last Revised: February 20, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-065

Risk Level: None

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The imap package provides server daemons for both the IMAP (Internet
Message Access Protocol) and POP (Post Office Protocol) mail access
protocols.

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the dmail and tmail mail
delivery
utilities shipped with imap. If either of these utilities were used as a
mail delivery agent, a remote attacker could potentially use this flaw
to
run arbitrary code as the targeted user by sending a specially-crafted
mail
message to the victim. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2008-5005](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5005) to this issue.

No Avaya system products are vulnerable, as imap is not installed by
default.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0275.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with the RHEL3 imap package installed: None

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |
| AES 4.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Looks like a null ptr dereference is possible here if smtp_send returns
smtp_fake (stream,"SMTP connection broken (command)");. Did anyone check the
security implications of this yet?

In the meantime the discoverer of this released an advisory:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-11-03 12:11:43 UTC  ``` UW-IMAP upstream developers released new upstream version - 2007d - that fixes security issue in dmail and tmail utilities.  Upstream announcement fails to detail those issue further.  References: <http://mailman2.u.washington.edu/pipermail/imap-uw/2008-October/002267.html> <http://mailman2.u.washington.edu/pipermail/imap-uw/2008-October/002268.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-11-03 12:15:17 UTC  ``` uw-imap as shipped with Fedora and EPEL was rebased to upstream version 2007d, updates should appear in stable repositories on the next push runs.  uw-imap is also shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3 (imap package).  Only Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 offers imap-utils subpackage with tmail and dmail utilities.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2008-11-03 12:16:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 322296](attachment.cgi?id=322296&action=diff "dmail 2007b -> 2007d diff") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=322296&action=edit "dmail 2007b -> 2007d diff") dmail 2007b -> 2007d diff  Fixes unbound strcpy to stack-based buffer.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2008-11-03 12:17:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 322297](attachment.cgi?id=322297&action=diff "tmail 2007b -> 2007d diff") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=322297&action=edit "tmail 2007b -> 2007d diff") tmail 2007b -> 2007d diff  Similar change to dmail change.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2008-11-03 13:41:00 UTC  ``` Further details from Pawel Salek:  It's a classical stack overflow that can be triggered by passing +VERYLONGSTRING as the argument to [dt]mail. The program attempts to copy the string to a temporary buffer without checking its length. This is only root exploit if the program is suid root. It is a remote exploit if the smtp delivery program passes the argument to tmail longer than 1024 characters (eg via $u variable in  define(`LOCAL_MAILER_ARGS', `tmail $u')dnl   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2008-11-03 13:48:54 UTC  ``` RFC 5321 defines that maximum length of the local part of the email address is 64 characters [1], but longer local parts seem to be accepted by MTAs.   [1] <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-4.5.3.1.1>  Sendmail restricts total length of the recipient email address to 255 characters, while buffer being overflow in [dt]mail has capacity for 1024 characters.  That seems to be the restriction mentioned in the upstream announcement that is preventing remote exploitation of the flaw.  However, Postfix is bit more permissive in this regard and it may be possible to trigger this issue if Postfix is configured to use [dt]mail as mailbox_command along with recipient_delimiter being set to +.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2008-11-03 15:42:08 UTC  ``` Bitsec security advisory for this issue:   <http://www.bitsec.com/en/rad/bsa-081103.txt>   <http://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&m=122572590212610&w=4>  PoC is expected to be published on 2008-11-10 at:   <http://www.bitsec.com/en/rad/bsa-081103.c>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=469667#c8)  Fedora Update System    2008-11-06 04:08:19 UTC  ``` uw-imap-2007d-1.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
