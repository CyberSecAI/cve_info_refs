The provided content is related to **CVE-2008-7267**, not CVE-2008-7268. The exploit-db entry mentions "SiteEngine 5.x - Multiple Vulnerabilities" and lists CVE-2008-7267. The Secunia content is a general overview and does not reference any specific CVE ID. Therefore, based on the provided content, here's information about **CVE-2008-7267**:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Incorrect use of the `intval` function, which allows bypassing logic that should be inspecting parameters, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the flawed use of `intval` and the construction of a SQL query using unsanitized user input.
- **URI Redirection:** The application allows for URI redirection by manipulating the `forward` parameter in `api.php?action=logout`.
- **Information Disclosure:** The application exposes PHP information through `misc.php?action=php_info`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database, modify data, or potentially gain full control of the database server.
- **URI Redirection:** An attacker can redirect users to a malicious site, potentially facilitating phishing attacks.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gather sensitive information about the server configuration and PHP environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** By crafting a malicious URL, specifically using a character like `%bf` in the `id` parameter, an attacker can bypass the `intval` check and inject SQL code into the query.
- **URI Redirection:** By setting the `forward` parameter to a malicious URL in `api.php?action=logout`.
- **Information Disclosure:** By simply navigating to `misc.php?action=php_info`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No special privileges or internal access to the system are needed, so the attacker can be remote.
