        "vulnerability": "CVE-2008-7064",
        "description": "Quicksilver Forums 1.4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Local File Inclusion. The vulnerability is due to insufficient filtering of user-supplied input in the 'lang' parameter of the 'get_lang' function within global.php. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files by using backslashes '\\' in the file path, bypassing the intended filtering. Additionally, the vulnerability is exploitable regardless of PHP's 'magic_quotes_gpc' setting due to the usage of the 'uset_magic_quotes_gpc()' function.",
        "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation and filtering in the get_lang() function within global.php, allowing for local file inclusion.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
            "Insufficient input validation",

        ],
        "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can upload a malicious avatar file containing PHP code and then include it to execute arbitrary commands on the server.",

            "HTTP GET request to index.php with a manipulated 'lang' parameter.",
