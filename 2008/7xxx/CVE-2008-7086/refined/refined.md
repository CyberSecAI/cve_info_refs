```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Insecure cookie handling. The application checks if the cookie `mecard_admin_cookie` equals the admin username, without proper validation or security measures.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper security checks on the cookie value. The application directly uses the cookie value to determine if a user is an administrator.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can gain administrative access to the application by setting the `mecard_admin_cookie` to the value of the administrator username which is hardcoded as "admin".
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through a crafted cookie.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to set cookies for the affected domain. This can be done through JavaScript execution on a page within that domain. The attacker can also use tools to manually set cookies.
