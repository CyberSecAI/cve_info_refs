  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `un64()` function in `util.cc` does not handle empty strings, leading to a segmentation fault when dereferencing a pointer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `un64()` function has a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP request with an Authorization header containing \"Basic \" followed by a space and no other data, or a special character.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server."
