Based on the provided information, here's a summary of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2008-7264:

*   **Vulnerability:** Socket handles are leaked in pyftpdlib when a data transfer is in progress and the user quits abruptly.
*   **Root Cause:** The data channel is not properly closed when a user quits during a file transfer, leading to unclosed socket handles.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Start an FTP server using pyftpdlib.
    2.  Connect to the server using an FTP client that opens an active data connection before STOR (e.g., using Linux's plain "ftp" client).
    3.  Attempt to put a file, which results in a 550 error (e.g., due to insufficient privileges).
    4.  Quit the FTP client.
    5.  The socket handles associated with the data connection are not closed properly.
*   **Impact:** Repeatedly performing the steps above will increase the number of used socket handles. Eventually, this will hit the system's file handle limit, causing the FTP server to become inoperative.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server and initiate a file transfer. They also need to be able to cause an error during the transfer (e.g. by not having the correct privilidges to upload) and then quit.
*   **Mitigation:** The provided snippet suggests adding a check in `ftpserver.py` to ensure the data channel is closed if a transfer is not in progress before closing the connection.

        if not self.data_channel:
            self.close_when_done()
        else:
            # tell the cmd channel to stop responding to commands.
            self.quit_pending = True
