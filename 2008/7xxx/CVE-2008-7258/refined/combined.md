| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=618132#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-07-26 08:39:12 UTC  ``` Brendan Boerner reported:   [1] [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ssmtp/+bug/282424](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ssmtp/%2Bbug/282424)  a deficiency in the way ssmtp removed trailing '\n' sequence by processing lines beginning with a leading dot. A local user, could send a specially-crafted e-mail message via ssmtp send-only sendmail emulator, leading to ssmtp executable denial of service (exit with: ssmtp: standardise() -- Buffer overflow). Different vulnerability than [CVE-2008-3962](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-3962).  References:   [2] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=582236](show_bug.cgi?id=582236 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-7258 standardise() -- Buffer overflow")   [3] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2008-3962>   [4] <http://patch-tracker.debian.org/package/ssmtp/2.62-3>   [5] <http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2010-May/041012.html>   [6] <http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2010-May/041009.html>   [7] <http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2010-May/041119.html>  Debian Linux distribution patch:   [8] <http://patch-tracker.debian.org/patch/series/view/ssmtp/2.62-3/345780-standardise-bufsize>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=618132#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-07-26 08:48:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following versions of ssmtp:   [1] ssmtp-2.61-14.el5 for Fedora EPEL 5   [2] ssmtp-2.61-14.el4 for Fedora EPEL 4   [3] ssmtp-2.61-14.fc13 for Fedora 13   [4] ssmtp-2.61-14.fc12 for Fedora 12   [5] ssmtp-2.61-14.fc11 for Fedora 11   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=618132#c2)  manuel wolfshant    2010-07-26 09:07:31 UTC  ``` Thank you, Jan.

Although I am quite puzzled, as I have applied the debian patch, <http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/rpms/ssmtp/devel/ssmtp-standardise.patch?revision=1.1&view=markup> Note that I have never been able to reproduce the bug.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=618132#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-08-03 13:55:53 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2008-7258](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-7258) has been assigned to this.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=618132#c4)  manuel wolfshant    2010-08-03 14:09:30 UTC  ``` ssmtp-2.61-15 has been pushed to all repos ( -testing for now) and it should solve the problem   ``` |  |

CVE-2008-7258 was assigned to this, but is it really a vulnerability?  It
seems like the attacker can only DoS himself.  Thoughts?

from one of our CVE analysts:

   The product's first relevant behavior is to call "fgets(buf,
   sizeof(buf), stdin)" -- this is a safe call and cannot overflow a
   buffer. There is a "char buf[(BUF_SZ + 1)]" declaration, and BUF_SZ is
   2048. The product then (in the standardise function) assigns sl to the
   strlen value of buf. It then performs the test "if((sl + 2) > BUF_SZ"
   and calls "exit(1)" if this test succeeds. If sl is 2047 or more, the
   test succeeds. If sl is 2046 or less, the test fails. In the 2046 case,
   the buffer has 2046 characters obtained from stdin, followed by a '\0'
   character. In this 2046 case, the product then calls memmove to move
   2047 characters forward by one in the buffer. In other words, characters at
   positions 0 through 2046 (inclusive) are moved to positions 1 through
   2047. This is OK because the valid positions in the buffer are 0 through
   2048. There are arguably two problems in the code. The first is that the
   fgets perhaps should not read more than 2046 characters, because the
   standardise function does not want to see more than 2046. This is only a
   usability problem. The role of the sSMTP product is to read a single
   e-mail message from stdin and then exit. The product does not maintain
   state, listen for connections, use setuid privileges, etc. The
   mishandling of messages with certain long lines only means that the
   sender of such a message can DoS himself. The issue does not cross
   privilege boundaries. Also note that the product cleanly detects the
   long line and calls exit(1) -- the product does not crash. The other
   problem in the code is that the standardise function apparently can
   handle 2047 characters but chooses to reject anything larger than 2046.
   Again, this is solely a usability problem.

Hi Steve,

I'm going to leave this one for you, I have no 2008 IDs.

Thanks.

Hi Steve, vendors,

   Brendan Boerner reported:
   [[1]](#1) [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ssmtp/+bug/282424](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ssmtp/%2Bbug/282424)

a deficiency in the way ssmtp removed trailing '\n' sequence
by processing lines beginning with a leading dot. A local user,
could send a specially-crafted e-mail message via ssmtp send-only
sendmail emulator, leading to ssmtp executable denial of service (exit with:
ssmtp: standardise() -- Buffer overflow). Different vulnerability
than CVE-2008-3962.

I planned to close it myself, but after checking the code, Fedora version seemed vulnerable to me.  I've double checked with Gentoo developers and got confirmation that 2.61 is affected as well, they only had a patch for it in their ssmtp packages in 2.61, and accidentally dropped it during the rebase to 2.62.

# ssmtp dies with standardise() -- Buffer overflow

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: ssmtp

A line which begins with a period ('.') and is BUZ\_SZ - 1 (e.g. 2047) or longer in length (not counting \n) will die() with:

ssmtp: standardise() -- Buffer overflow

This is a specific case. The general case is if a buffer passed into standardise() begins with a period and is BUF\_SZ - 1 bytes in length will produce this error.

I think the fix is to call fgets() with sizeof(buf) - 2 instead of sizeof(buf) in ssmtp().

With this fix another problem is that in the sent e-mail the line is truncated by two bytes. The fix is to use (BUF\_SZ) in smtp\_write() instead of (BUF\_SZ - 2).
