I used to use this plugin on a few sites but no longer use it but when I updated my sites from PHP 5.6 to 7.2 it caused the site to return with Error 500 messages.
Error log spit out: [21-Jun-2018 18:13:35 UTC] PHP Fatal error: Redefinition of parameter $path in /home/…/public\_html/wp-content/plugins/tubepress/src/main/php/add-ons/wordpress/classes/tubepress/addons/wordpress/spi/WordPressFunctionWrapper.php on line 213

This used to be good, however the plugin is no longer supported and potentially dangerous.

Used to be helpful but has moved to premium-only model and this version is no longer supported, doesn’t work. Look elsewhere for a free youtube/vimeo plugin.

Free plugin is worthless
Pro is too costly for use on more than one site.
