      "details": "An old bug workaround in the OpenSSL SSL/TLS server code allows malicious clients to modify the stored session cache ciphersuite. In some cases, the ciphersuite can be downgraded to a weaker one on subsequent connections.\n\nThis affects SSL/TLS servers that enable the workaround for an old Netscape server SSL implementation bug - SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG.\n\nAn attacker able to sniff the session identifier can use this flaw to force a change of the cipher suite in the stored session. A client that later resumes that session may start using a different (weaker) cipher suite chosen by the attacker.\n\nOpenSSL versions prior to 0.9.8j allowed an attacker to change the stored session cipher to an arbitrary cipher suite supported by OpenSSL. Version 0.9.8j corrected this issue to only allow changing the cipher suite to those the server is configured to use.\n\nIn both cases, the client must accept the cipher suite change on resume for the downgrade attack to succeed."
