Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in relation to CVE-2008-7091:

**CVE-2008-7091 is associated with multiple vulnerabilities in Pligg CMS 9.9.0 and earlier.**

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Unsanitized user input (GPC variables) passed directly to the Smarty template engine.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Lack of sanitization in file handling operations based on cookie input for templates and languages.
*   **SQL Injection:** Unsanitized user-supplied input used directly in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XSS:** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input before rendering it in a web page. Specifically, the "keyword" parameter in user.php when "view" is set to "search" is vulnerable.
*   **LFI:** The application allows inclusion of arbitrary files through the "template" parameter via the settemplate.php script. This is due to the lack of sanitization of the 'template' value before being used in file inclusion operations. Also file enumeration via `trackback.php` by manipulating `tb_url`
*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities exist throughout the application (vote.php, trackback.php, submit.php, story.php, recommend.php, cloud.php, out.php, login.php, cvote.php, edit.php) where user-provided input is used in database queries without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:**
    *   Theft of user cookies, leading to session hijacking and impersonation.
    *   Potential for redirecting users to malicious sites.
*  **LFI:**
    *   Arbitrary file access, leading to information disclosure.
    *   Arbitrary file inclusion can lead to remote code execution.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive database information, including user credentials.
    *   Potential for unauthorized data modification and deletion.
    *   Remote code execution through arbitrary PHP code placed in template files

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** By crafting a malicious URL with JavaScript in the `keyword` parameter of user.php.
*   **LFI:** By manipulating the `template` parameter in the settemplate.php script or manipulating the `tb_url` in `trackback.php`
*   **SQL Injection:** By crafting malicious inputs to affected scripts (vote.php, trackback.php, submit.php, story.php, recommend.php, cloud.php, out.php, login.php, cvote.php, edit.php) via POST/GET parameters

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Pligg application.
*   No special privileges or prior access is required, the attacks can be performed remotely by anyone who can reach the application.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**
The advisory details multiple severe vulnerabilities: Cross-site scripting, Local file inclusion and multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities, when combined, allow for remote code execution on the affected installation.
