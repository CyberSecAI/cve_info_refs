The provided content relates to CVE-2008-7262.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks on symbolic links within the pyftpdlib FTP server. When a client provides a symbolic link as part of a command argument, the server doesn't verify if the link points to a location outside the user's home directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability via symbolic links.
- Inability to restrict access to the filesystem outside user's home directory when symlinks are used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can gain access to arbitrary system files and directories outside of their authorized home directory.
- Attackers could potentially read, write, delete or overwrite arbitrary system files, depending on the server's running privileges and command used (e.g. DELE, STOR, RETR)
- Attackers can list content of directories outside of their home directory via CWD and LIST commands

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker uses an FTP client to connect to the pyftpdlib server.
- The attacker manipulates the file system within the user's home directory by creating symlinks that points to arbitrary files/directories.
- The attacker sends FTP commands such as CWD, LIST, DELE, STOR and RETR with arguments containing the created symbolic links to access files or directories outside of the userâ€™s home directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs a valid account on the FTP server.
- The attacker needs the ability to create symlinks in their home directory on the server.
- Basic knowledge of FTP commands is necessary.
