The provided content relates to multiple CVEs, including CVE-2006-5752, CVE-2007-1863, CVE-2007-3304 and CVE-2007-3847, but not CVE-2008-7195.

The document from Fujitsu details several vulnerabilities found in their Interstage HTTP Server, which are linked to the mentioned CVEs.  It does not provide any information for CVE-2008-7195.

Based on the provided information, the relevant details are for other CVEs:

**CVE-2006-5752:**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the server status monitoring functionality of Interstage HTTP Server.
*   **Vulnerability:** XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
*   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the server status monitoring pages, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's browser.
*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious script injection via the server status monitoring functionality.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into a parameter or part of the server that would get rendered by the server.

**CVE-2007-1863:**

*   **Root Cause:** Denial of service vulnerability in the cache functionality of Interstage HTTP Server.
*   **Vulnerability:** DoS (Denial of Service)
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially cause the server to become unavailable to legitimate users by exploiting the cache functionality.
*  **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the cache functionality.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send requests that would trigger the vulnerable cache handling code on the server.

**CVE-2007-3304:**

*   **Root Cause:** Denial of service vulnerability related to sending specified process signals in Interstage HTTP Server.
*   **Vulnerability:** DoS (Denial of Service)
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially cause the server to become unavailable by exploiting the signal sending functionality.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the process signal functionality
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send specific signals that would trigger the vulnerable code on the server.

**CVE-2007-3847:**

*   **Root Cause:** Denial of service vulnerability in the proxy functionality of Interstage HTTP Server.
*   **Vulnerability:** DoS (Denial of Service)
*   **Impact:**  An attacker could potentially cause the server to become unavailable by exploiting the proxy functionality.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the proxy functionality.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send requests that would trigger the vulnerable proxy handling code on the server.

The content also mentions other DoS vulnerabilities related to specific requests and SSL operations, but without an associated CVE. It also provides patch information for various versions of Interstage Application Server, Apworks, Studio, Business Application Server, and Job Workload Server across multiple operating systems.

Since the content does not contain any information regarding CVE-2008-7195, the response is:
