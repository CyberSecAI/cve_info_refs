- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Velocity web-server had a directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allowed attackers to use directory traversal techniques in the URL.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to files and directories on the server by sending a URL with directory traversal sequences. This could allow them to read sensitive files, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through HTTP requests. An attacker can send a specially crafted URL to the server with directory traversal sequences like `../` to access files outside of the web server's root directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Velocity web-server. No special privileges are required for exploiting the vulnerability, just network access to the server.
