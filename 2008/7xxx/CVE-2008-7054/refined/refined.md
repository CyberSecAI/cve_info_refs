### Relevant Content:
The provided content discusses multiple Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities in EZContents CMS version 2.0.3. These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to include local files on the server, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or code execution.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerabilities stem from insufficient sanitization and validation of user-supplied input in various PHP scripts within the CMS. Specifically, the `link` parameter in `module.php` and several other parameters in module-specific scripts are not properly checked before being used in `include()` statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **LFI in `module.php`**: The `link` parameter is only sanitized by removing `../` sequences, which can be bypassed. The `isExternalLink()` function does not prevent local file inclusion.
2.  **LFI in module scripts**: Multiple scripts in the `/modules/` directory, such as `/modules/diary/showdiary.php`, are vulnerable due to the usage of insufficiently validated global variables like `rootdp`, `gsLanguage`, `language_home`, `admin_home`, and `modfiledir` in `include` statements. These vulnerabilities are present in `showdiary.php`, `showeventlist.php`, `showgallery.php`, `showreviews.php`, `showdiarydetail.php`, `showgallerydetails.php`, `showreviewsdetails.php`, `shownewsdetails.php`, `submit_diary.php`, `submit_gallery.php`, `submit_guestbook.php`, `submit_reviews.php`, `submit_news.php`, `archivednews_summary.php`, `news_summary.php`, `inlineeventlist.php` and `inlinenews.php`.
3.  **Reliance on `register_globals`**: Many LFI vulnerabilities in module scripts require `register_globals` to be enabled, which is considered a security risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure**: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server that the webserver user has access to, potentially revealing sensitive configuration data, usernames, passwords, or source code.
*   **Code Execution**: By including files containing malicious code, an attacker could achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Requests**: The attacker exploits the vulnerabilities by crafting malicious HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP scripts and manipulating parameters like `link`, `rootdp`, `gsLanguage`, `language_home`, `admin_home`, and `modfiledir`
*   **Path Traversal**: The attacker uses path traversal sequences (`../`) combined with null byte injection (`%00`) to access files outside the intended webroot or include restricted files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Understanding of Vulnerable Parameters**: The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameters and scripts in order to craft their malicious requests.
*   **PHP `register_globals`**: For some vulnerabilities, `register_globals` needs to be enabled on the server.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability report mentions that the initial fix for the `link` parameter vulnerability in `module.php` was insufficient, as it only removed `../` from the path, which was still bypassable.
*   The vulnerabilities were reported to the vendor, but no response or solution was provided as of the date of the advisory.
*   The advisory details multiple vulnerable files and parameters, and provides proof-of-concept URLs to exploit these vulnerabilities
