Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure in the McAfee SafeBoot Device Encryption software to properly sanitize the BIOS keyboard buffer after reading passwords during pre-boot authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The software utilizes the BIOS API to read user input (passwords).
- The BIOS keyboard buffer, where keystrokes are temporarily stored, is not cleared or flushed after use.
- This leaves the plain text password accessible in the BIOS Data Area.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Plain text password disclosure:** An attacker can read the user's password in plain text from the BIOS keyboard buffer.
- This allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to encrypted device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack can be performed by a local user with guest access to the system.
- No physical access is required to exploit the vulnerability beyond having the machine in front of you.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user access on a vulnerable machine
- Ability to read the contents of physical memory location `0x40:0x1e`

**Affected Software:**
- McAfee SafeBoot Device Encryption v4, Build 4750 and below.

**Unaffected Software:**
- SafeBoot Device Encryption v4, Build 4760 and above.
- SafeBoot Device Encryption v5.x.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor (McAfee) recommends upgrading to the current version of SafeBoot Device Encryption v4 or migrating to McAfee Endpoint Encryption for PC v5 platform.
- The vulnerability was discovered by iViZ Techno Solutions.
