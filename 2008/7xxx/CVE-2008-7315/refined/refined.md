```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The UI::Dialog Perl module, when using the 'dialog' backend, fails to properly escape shell metacharacters in strings passed to it.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input sanitization/escaping leading to arbitrary command execution.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the system where the vulnerable code is running.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing specially crafted strings containing shell metacharacters to the UI::Dialog module. This could occur if the input to the module is derived from an untrusted source like an email or URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input strings that are passed to the vulnerable UI::Dialog module. This can be achieved remotely if the application is processing untrusted data like URLs from an email or other remote sources."
