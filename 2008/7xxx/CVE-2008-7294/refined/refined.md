Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability information, focusing on cookie manipulation and its implications:

**Vulnerability:** Cookie Forcing

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that HTTP responses can set, overwrite, or delete cookies used by an HTTPS session. This violates the intended integrity of HTTPS sessions, as HTTP responses are not secure, even for secure cookies. This is due to browser behavior and by specification, not a bug in the application itself. The "Secure" flag for cookies is not enough to prevent this vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Lack of Cookie Integrity:** Browsers allow HTTP responses to manipulate cookies that were initially set via HTTPS, even if the cookies have the "Secure" flag.
    *   **Trust in Cookie Values:**  Applications incorrectly assume that cookie values received will be unchanged, which opens doors for various attacks.
    *   **Frameworks Reading Cookies without Sanitization:** Some frameworks read cookie values and use them in a way that allows the injection of malicious code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious cookie values can be injected into the DOM, leading to XSS.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF):** Attackers can manipulate cookie values used for XSRF protection.
    *   **Login XSRF:** Attackers can exploit login XSRF vulnerabilities.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) & Logic Abuse:** Manipulating cookies can lead to unexpected app behavior or denial-of-service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker intercepts HTTP traffic to inject malicious cookies by redirecting to the HTTP version of the site and then injecting a `Set-Cookie` header. This doesn't involve breaking the HTTPS connection, but manipulating HTTP requests.
    *   **HTTP Interception:** Attackers intercept unrelated HTTP requests (e.g., to other sites or background requests), and inject malicious cookies through a series of redirects and Set-Cookie headers.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Active MitM:** The attacker must be in a position to intercept and modify HTTP traffic. This can be done on public wireless networks, or through malicious networks.

**Additional Context from the Content:**

*   **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** As noted in multiple comments, HSTS can defend against cookie forcing, particularly if HSTS is configured to include subdomains. HSTS forces the browser to navigate directly to HTTPS, preventing the initial HTTP request that's needed for the cookie forcing attack, especially after the first visit to the site where HSTS is configured. The article mentions it defends against "cookie forcing".
*   **Mitigation:** The primary mitigation is to change browser behavior to disallow HTTP `Set-Cookie` messages from modifying cookies that were originally set via HTTPS. The comments suggest further potential mitigations:
    *   Cryptographically signing cookies.
    *   Randomizing the name of session cookies.
*   **Browser Behavior:** Browsers accept `Set-Cookie` statements in HTTP responses even for cookies previously set via HTTPS, and marked as "secure".
*   **Bugzilla XSS:** A specific instance of this vulnerability was found in older versions of Bugzilla, where a compromised BUGLIST cookie could lead to XSS and HTML injection in the `<head>` tag.

**In summary, the content describes a significant vulnerability related to how browsers handle cookies, especially secure cookies. This "cookie forcing" attack does not break HTTPS connections, but leverages HTTP interception to maliciously modify cookie values and cause security issues with HTTPS applications.  HSTS is a key defense against this type of attack.**

**Relevance to CVE-2008-7294:**
Based on the content, the blog posts from Chris Evans discuss "cookie forcing" and "surfjacking" which were discovered in November of 2008. CVE-2008-7294 is a placeholder, but the described vulnerabilities are highly likely to be related to the "cookie forcing" vulnerabilities.
