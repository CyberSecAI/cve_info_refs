```
- Root cause of vulnerability: SQL injection in the `autoDetectRegion()` function in `/doceboCore/lib/lib.regset.php`. The function uses the `HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE` header without proper sanitization in a SQL query.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - SQL injection: The `browser_language` variable, extracted from the `HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE` header, is directly included in a SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing for SQL injection.
  - Path disclosure: Multiple files reveal the full path of the web application.
- Impact of exploitation:
  - Remote command execution: By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can inject PHP code into a file within the web server's directory by using `INTO DUMPFILE`, which requires FILE privilege for the database user.
  - Arbitrary code execution: After injecting the malicious PHP code, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by sending a crafted request to the injected php file.
- Attack vectors:
  - HTTP `Accept-Language` header: The SQL injection is triggered by manipulating the `Accept-Language` header in an HTTP request.
  - HTTP requests: The attacker uses HTTP requests to trigger the SQL injection and to execute the injected code.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
  - The attacker needs FILE privilege on the database server to be able to use `INTO DUMPFILE` statement.
