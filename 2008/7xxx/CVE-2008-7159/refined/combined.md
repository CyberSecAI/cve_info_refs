How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : silc-client/silc-toolkit
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2008-7159 CVE-2008-7160 CVE-2009-3051

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the software suite for the
SILC protocol, a network protocol designed to provide end-to-end security
for conferencing services.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

An incorrect format string in sscanf() used in the ASN1 encoder to scan an
OID value could overwrite a neighbouring variable on the stack as the
destination data type is smaller than the source type on 64-bit. On 64-bit
architectures this could result in unexpected application behaviour or even
code execution in some cases (CVE-2008-7159).

Various format string vulnerabilities when handling parsed SILC messages
allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the rights of the victim
running the SILC client via crafted nick names or channel names containing
format strings (CVE-2009-3051).

An incorrect format string in a sscanf() call used in the HTTP server
component of silcd could result in overwriting a neighbouring variable on
the stack as the destination data type is smaller than the source type on
64-bit.  An attacker could exploit this by using crafted Content-Length
header values resulting in unexpected application behaviour or even code
execution in some cases (CVE-2008-7160).

silc-server doesn't need an update as it uses the shared library provided
by silc-toolkit. silc-client/silc-toolkit in the oldstable distribution
(etch) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.7-2+lenny1 of silc-toolkit and in version 1.1.4-1+lenny1
of silc-client.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.10-1 of silc-toolkit and version 1.1-2 of silc-client
(using libsilc from silc-toolkit since this upload).

We recommend that you upgrade your silc-toolkit/silc-client packages.

Subject: CVE id request: silc-toolkit

Hi,
silc-toolkit upstream fixed [0] various security issues which
from my assessment allow an attacker arbitrary code
execution. I'd like to get some CVE ids for these.

|    ASN1: Fix stack variable overwrite when encoding OID.
|
|    The call to sscanf specifies a format string of "%lu", a long unsigned
|    int.  The pointer argument was cast to unsigned long *, but this is
|    wrong for 64 bit systems.  On 64 bit systems, unsigned long is 64 bits,
|    but the oid value is a SilcUInt32 on all systems.  As a result, sscanf
|    will overwrite a neighboring variable on the stack.  Fix this by
|    changing the format string to "%u" and removing the cast.

|    Fixed string format vulnerability in client entry handling.
|
|    Reported and patch provided by William Cummings.

This one allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, tested.

|     More string format fixes in silcd and client libary

From what I see this is only a problem if full_channel_names settings is used in
SilcClientParams and can't be triggered by an attacker but only by the victim,
maybe I miss something, I'm not that familar with the silc protocol.

|    HTTP: fix stack overwrite due to format string error.
|
|    On AMD64, %lu refers to a 64-bit unsigned value, but the address passed
|    to sscanf points to a 32-bit unsigned value.  This causes an adjoining
|    value on the stack to be overwritten with data from the converted
|    integer.  Fix the format string to match the size of the supplied value,
|    and remove the pointer cast.

This is only a problem if the internal http server e.g. for checking stats
is enabled.

Can I get CVE ids for the above issues?
The upstream patch is attached.

Cheers
Nico

This was actually fixed in 1.1.8 back in 2008:

  <http://silcnet.org/docs/changelog/SILC%20Toolkit%201.1.8>

Use CVE-2008-7159, to be filled in later.

Use CVE-2009-3051 for both of these format strings, to be filled in later.

> |    HTTP: fix stack overwrite due to format string error.

Appears to be from
<http://silcnet.org/docs/changelog/SILC%20Toolkit%201.1.9>.

Use CVE-2008-7160, to be filled in later.

with parsing XML data might allow a remote client to create a
denial-of-service condition on the system that the JRE runs on.
CVE-2008-5349: A vulnerability in how the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) handles certain RSA public keys might cause the JRE to consume
an excessive amount of CPU resources. This might lead to a Denial of
Service (DoS) condition on affected systems. Such keys could be
provided by a remote client of an application.
This issue affects the following security providers: IBMJCE,
IBMPKCS11Impl and IBMJCEFIPS.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLES9, SLE11

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
