```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the login functionality and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability due to insufficient output encoding in the 'start' parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful SQL injection can lead to authentication bypass, allowing unauthorized access to the application. Successful XSS can lead to arbitrary javascript execution within the victim's browser.",
  "Attack vectors": "SQL injection via crafted username input in the login form and XSS via crafted 'start' parameter in the URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to submit HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application, and has to be able to provide a payload to the 'start' parameter in the case of XSS. In the case of SQLi, the attacker must have access to the login form."
