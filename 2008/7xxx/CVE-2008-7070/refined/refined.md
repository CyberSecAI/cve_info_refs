{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Improper command-line parsing of URI handlers in KVIrc.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Command Injection",
        "Insufficient input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote command execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running KVIrc.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted irc://, irc6://, ircs://, and ircs6:// URI handlers. By embedding the malicious URI in a web page or other document, the attacker can entice a user to click the link, thereby executing the attacker's commands.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to click a specially crafted URI link. No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability besides having KVIrc installed."
