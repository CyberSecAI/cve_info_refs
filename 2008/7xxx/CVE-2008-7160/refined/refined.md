Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-7160:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect format string used in the `sscanf()` function within the HTTP server component of `silcd`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The `sscanf()` function was using a `%lu` format specifier, which represents an unsigned long integer (64-bit on 64-bit systems). However, the address passed to `sscanf` pointed to a 32-bit unsigned integer. This mismatch in size resulted in a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stack Variable Overwrite:** Due to the format string vulnerability, `sscanf()` overwrites a neighboring variable on the stack.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious `Content-Length` header value containing format string specifiers, an attacker could potentially overwrite critical stack data, leading to unexpected application behavior and, in some cases, arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Header Manipulation:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `silcd` HTTP server component. The crafted request would need to include a malicious `Content-Length` header value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable `silcd` service.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests with manipulated headers.
*   The internal http server (e.g., for checking stats) needs to be enabled on the vulnerable `silcd` instance.

**Summary of CVE-2008-7160:**

CVE-2008-7160 describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the SILC toolkit's HTTP server component (`silcd`) due to an incorrect format string used in `sscanf()`. An attacker could exploit this by sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a malicious `Content-Length` header, leading to a stack variable overwrite and potentially arbitrary code execution.

The provided content from the mailing list provides more technical details than the CVE description itself and confirms that the vulnerability is exploitable for arbitrary code execution.
