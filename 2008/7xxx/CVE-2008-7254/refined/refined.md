```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to insecure handling of the `_Root_Path` parameter within the `includes/template-loader.php` file. The script directly includes a file path provided through this parameter without proper sanitization or validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially leading to information disclosure of sensitive data, source code, or even remote code execution if an attacker can control the included file.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `_Root_Path` parameter to `includes/template-loader.php`.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."
