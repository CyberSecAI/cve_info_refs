  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted SIP message to the target device via UDP on port 5060.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The device's SIP implementation does not properly handle a malformed SIP message, leading to a denial-of-service condition."
      ],

      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack vector is network-based, utilizing UDP on port 5060."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the target device on port 5060. No authentication or prior access is required.",
       "additional_details": "The provided exploit code demonstrates the exact SIP message used to trigger the vulnerability. The vendor was notified in 2007, but no fix was available at the time of the report in November 2008."
