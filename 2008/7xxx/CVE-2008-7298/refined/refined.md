The provided content discusses "cookie forcing" and its implications, which are relevant to the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-7298 (though the CVE is not explicitly mentioned).

Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a vulnerability in how browsers handle cookies. Specifically, HTTP responses can set, overwrite, or delete cookies used by an HTTPS session. This behavior exists by specification and the "Secure" flag on cookies does not prevent this.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cookie Integrity Violation:** HTTP responses can modify cookies of an HTTPS session.
*   **XSS Vulnerability:** If an application trusts the cookie value to be properly escaped when rendering to the DOM, it could lead to XSS. This includes situations where JSON is stored within cookies and parsed with `eval`.
*   **XSRF Vulnerability:**  XSRF protections that rely on comparing a URL parameter with a cookie value can be bypassed because the attacker can modify both values.
*   **Login XSRF:** Attackers can use cookie forcing to manipulate login-related cookies, potentially bypassing login CSRF protections.
*   **DoS:** Attackers can modify cookie values to cause unexpected behavior or denial-of-service conditions on the application.
*   **Logic abuse:** Attackers can modify cookie values to induce misbehavior when the application encounters unexpected values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Attackers can inject malicious values into cookies, leading to various exploits, including XSS, XSRF, login XSRF, DoS, and logic abuse.
*   Attackers can gain control over a user's session on a website, even when that site uses HTTPS and secure cookies.
*   The attack occurs without the user being aware, as the malicious actions are carried out in the background via HTTP requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify HTTP traffic between the victim and the internet.
*   The attacker does not need to intercept the HTTPS connection; they target other HTTP requests from the victim.
*   The MITM intercepts a victim's HTTP request to another site and redirects it to the target site using HTTP. The attacker can then respond to this HTTP request with a `Set-Cookie` header.
*   This allows the attacker to inject a new cookie on the user's browser for the target site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Active MITM capability:** The attacker must be in a position to intercept and modify HTTP traffic.
*   **No SSL interception required**: The attacker does not need to break or intercept the HTTPS connection. They are exploiting the ability to set cookies via HTTP on the targeted domain.

**Additional Details:**

*   The attack can be combined with techniques that leverage browser background HTTP requests. This makes it more stealthy, as the user might not notice redirections and malicious actions.
*   HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) can help mitigate this vulnerability by enforcing HTTPS connections, though the first visit remains vulnerable.
*   The blog post references an older post titled "Owning the paranoid: browser background traffic" which may provide further insight on the attack

**Summary of CVE-2011-2976 (Bugzilla XSS):**
The vulnerability described in Bugzilla is a XSS issue within Bugzilla versions 3.4.11 and below, specifically related to the `BUGLIST` cookie. If the `BUGLIST` cookie is compromised, an attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript via the `bug_list.first` and `bug_list.last` variables in the `bug/navigate.html.tmpl` template.  The vulnerability also affects `global/site-navigation.html.tmpl`. The Bugzilla bug report acknowledges that while compromising the `BUGLIST` cookie was not considered a straightforward task within Bugzilla itself, the cookie forcing technique discussed could potentially be used to inject malicious content into that cookie.

**Relationship to CVE-2008-7298**

While not explicitly mentioned in the provided content, the "cookie forcing" vulnerability discussed is highly relevant to the issues described in CVE-2008-7298 and CVE-2011-2976, providing technical insight into its mechanics and impact.

The content from scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com explains the underlying issue of cookie forcing which allows for exploitation of other vulnerabilities (like the Bugzilla one in CVE-2011-2976)

The content from michael-coates.blogspot.com, further clarifies the mechanics of how cookies can be set over HTTP even if the original cookie was created over HTTPS. This explanation is crucial to understand why a MITM attacker does not need to break an HTTPS connection to inject malicious cookies.

The Bugzilla bug report explains a concrete example of how the cookie forcing vulnerability can be used to create an XSS vulnerability in a web application.
