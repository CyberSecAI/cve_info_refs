- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when handling the `filename` parameter within the `downloadfile` action of the XOOPS Module Uploader module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exists in the `index.php` file. Specifically, the `filename` parameter in the `downloadfile` action is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can exploit the LFI vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information. By using directory traversal techniques such as `../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, they can access files outside of the intended directory.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL. Specifically, the `filename` parameter is manipulated to perform directory traversal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable URL. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
