Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2008-7251:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- phpMyAdmin was creating temporary directories with insecure (world-writable) filesystem permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Insecure Permissions:** The primary issue is the creation of world-writable temporary directories. This allows any user on the system to read, modify, or delete files within that directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Misuse of Temporary Directory:** The insecurely created world-writable temporary directory could be misused. The provided text does not explicitly clarify what this misuse could be, but potential impacts include:
    -   **Information Disclosure:**  Unauthorized users could potentially access sensitive data stored in temporary files within the directory.
    -   **Data Modification:** Malicious users could modify temporary files, leading to unexpected behavior or system compromise.
    -   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could fill the temporary directory with junk data, leading to denial of service conditions or resource exhaustion.
    -   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly stated, if temporary files are used in privileged operations, manipulating them could potentially lead to privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local Access:** This is primarily a local vulnerability. An attacker needs to have access to the system where phpMyAdmin is running.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Local System User:**  The attacker needs to be a local user on the system running phpMyAdmin. This user does not require special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content from phpmyadmin.net indicates that the vulnerability was considered "not critical".
- Patches were made available in phpMyAdmin versions 2.11.10 and 3.0.0, indicating the fix involves ensuring temporary directories are created with more restrictive permissions.
- The Debian security advisory DSA-2034-1 also mentions this CVE and indicates that version phpmyadmin 2.11.8.1-5+lenny4 fixes the issue in Debian stable (lenny) and version 3.2.4-1 for Debian unstable (sid)
- The SUSE Security Summary Report (SUSE-SR:2010:001) also mentions this vulnerability (along with CVE-2008-7252 and CVE-2009-4605) as being fixed in their update, indicating it is a general issue across distributions.
- The Secunia Research information is generic and does not provide specific details on CVE-2008-7251.
