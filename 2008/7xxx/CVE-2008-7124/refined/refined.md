Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-7124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `admin/configuration/modifier.php` script of zKup CMS. Specifically, when adding a new administrator, the script uses a regular expression (`#^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$#`) to validate the login value, which is intended to check if the login is alphanumeric. This regex can be bypassed by injecting a NULL byte (%00) into the login string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the insufficient validation of the 'login' field when adding a new administrator. The regex check fails to prevent the injection of a NULL byte, which is then interpreted as a string terminator.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** By injecting the NULL byte, followed by malicious PHP code, the attacker can write arbitrary content into the `config.php` file. This allows the attacker to inject a PHP-based file uploader.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The injected PHP code enables an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server. This can lead to a complete compromise of the web server and the website.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to create a new administrator account and gain full control over the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `admin/configuration/modifier.php` script. The request includes a modified `login` parameter that contains the NULL byte and PHP code to create a file upload script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable zKup CMS instance.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The exploit can be executed without any prior authentication. The vulnerability allows bypassing access control and arbitrary file uploads.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable script (`admin/configuration/modifier.php`).

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit code includes logic to prevent corrupting the config.php file by adding lines before and after the uploaded code, preserving the original configuration structure.
*   The exploit targets zKup CMS versions 2.0 to 2.3.
*   The `magic_quotes_gpc` setting in PHP needs to be off for this specific exploit to work.

The exploit code from exploit-db.com includes two separate scripts: one to upload a PHP file uploader and another to add a new administrator, but they both exploit the same underlying vulnerability, which is a flawed input validation that can be bypassed with a null byte.
