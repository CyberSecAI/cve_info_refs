Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-7031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a heap overflow vulnerability present in Foxit Remote Access Server (WAC Server).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Overflow via Telnet Options:** The WAC server is susceptible to a heap overflow when processing Telnet options that exceed 260 bytes.
- **Heap Overflow via SSH Packets:** The server is also vulnerable to a heap overflow when handling large SSH packets. While the content notes that further research was not conducted into this specific vulnerability, it is still identified as a weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of either of these heap overflows could lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Telnet Option Overflow:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted telnet options that are longer than the expected 260 bytes.
- **SSH Packet Overflow:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending oversized SSH packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be able to send specially crafted Telnet option packets to the vulnerable WAC Server or oversized SSH packets. This implies network access to the server.
- No authentication information is given in the provided text but the underlying protocols likely require some type of authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit author provides proof-of-concept code available for download, allowing for reproduction and verification of the vulnerability.
-  The vulnerability affects versions of Foxit Remote Access Server (WAC Server) up to and including version 2.0 build 3503.
- No fix was available at the time of the report
