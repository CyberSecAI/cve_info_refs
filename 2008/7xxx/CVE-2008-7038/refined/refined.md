Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2008-7038:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `gid` parameter of the `My_eGallery` module for both XOOPS and PHP-Nuke. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is a SQL injection. Specifically, the `gid` parameter, used in a SQL query, is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, leading to unauthorized database access and manipulation.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and password hashes.
    *   **Potential Account Compromise:** By retrieving user credentials, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Although not specifically shown in the provided exploits, a SQL injection could potentially allow an attacker to modify or delete data in the database.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `index.php` page of the `My_eGallery` module, by manipulating the `gid` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
    *   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Module:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `My_eGallery` module and its associated parameters.
    *   **Basic Understanding of SQL:**  The attacker needs to know how to craft SQL injection payloads.

**Specific Exploits:**

Two exploits are detailed, one for XOOPS and another for PHP-Nuke:

1.  **XOOPS Module My\_eGallery 3.04 Exploit:**
    *   Vulnerable URL:  `modules/my_egallery/index.php?do=showgall&gid=-9999999/**/union/**/select/**/0,1,concat(uname,0x3a,pass),3,4,5,6/**/from+xoops_users/*`
    *   This exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve the `uname` (username) and `pass` (password hash) from the `xoops_users` table.

2.  **PHP-Nuke Module My\_eGallery 2.7.9 Exploit:**
    *   Vulnerable URL: `modules.php?op=modload&name=My_eGallery&file=index&do=showgall&gid=-1/**/union/**/select/**/aid,pwd/**/from/**/nuke_authors/**/where/**/radminsuper=1/*`
    *   This exploit targets the `nuke_authors` table to retrieve the `aid` (author id) and `pwd` (password hash) of a user with `radminsuper=1` (likely an admin).

Both exploits use the same basic technique of injecting a SQL `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the database, illustrating how the `gid` parameter can be leveraged to perform SQL injection attacks.

**Additional Notes**

* The exploits are publicly available and were found by the Aria-Security Team and S@BUN, respectively.
* The exploits were originally published on milw0rm.com (now defunct).
* Both exploits use similar SQL injection techniques but target different tables relevant to the respective CMS platform (XOOPS vs PHP-Nuke).
