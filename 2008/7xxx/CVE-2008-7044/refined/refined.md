Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-7044:

**Content Overview:**

The provided content is from Exploit-DB and describes multiple vulnerabilities in the AJSquare Free Polling Script (DB version).  It lists CVE-2008-7044, along with CVE-2008-7045 and CVE-2008-7046. The content details a blind SQL injection vulnerability in `newpoll.php` and a vote reset vulnerability in `resetvote.php`.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The `newpoll.php` script directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$_GET[ques]`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Vote Reset:** The `resetvote.php` script can be accessed directly without any authorization, allowing anyone to reset the poll votes.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** The `newpoll.php` script exhibits a blind SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `ques` parameter, and based on the response, determine information about the database.
    *   **Unrestricted Access:** The `resetvote.php` script allows unauthorized access, permitting anyone to reset poll votes.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or potentially gain further access to the server.
    *   **Vote Manipulation:** An attacker can arbitrarily reset all poll votes.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Sending specially crafted requests to `newpoll.php` with malicious SQL code in the `ques` parameter via HTTP GET request.
    *   **Vote Reset:** Direct access of `resetvote.php` via HTTP GET request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
    *   **Vote Reset:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The SQL injection vulnerability is located in `admin/include/newpoll.php`:
    ```php
    $sqlnew = "select * from newpoll where question='$ques'";
    ```
    The `$_GET['ques']` variable is directly included in the SQL query without any escaping or sanitization.
*   The vote reset vulnerability is due to the lack of authorization on the `admin/resetvote.php` page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db content provides specific examples of how to exploit the blind SQLi vulnerability using the `substring` function in MySQL.
*   The provided content does not include a specific exploit for CVE-2008-7044, but it highlights the SQL injection and the insecure vote reset.
*   The content mentions "multiple vulnerabilities" and lists three CVEs, but this analysis only focuses on the information about CVE-2008-7044
*   The vulnerability allows for information disclosure and data modification due to SQLi. It can also manipulate the vote counts.
