Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `Net::Ping::External` Perl module doesn't properly sanitize arguments passed to it, specifically those representing hostnames. It uses backticks to execute shell commands based on the provided hostname, making it vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The module utilizes backticks ` `` ` to execute external commands without properly escaping or sanitizing input. Specifically, the `_ping_external` subroutine does not properly sanitize hostname arguments.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code lacks proper validation or escaping of shell metacharacters in the provided arguments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious shell commands within the hostname argument, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server running the vulnerable code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Hostnames:**  An attacker can provide a crafted hostname that contains shell metacharacters. These characters will be executed by the underlying shell.
   -  Example:  A hostname like `127.0.0.1; id > /tmp/output.txt` would execute the `id` command and redirect the output to `/tmp/output.txt`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to supply input to the `Net::Ping::External` module:** An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the hostname argument passed to functions in `Net::Ping::External` when pinging an external host.
- **The vulnerable code must be executed on the server.**

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to be present for approximately 10 years before being addressed.
- A patch was proposed and is available.
- The issue affects versions of `Net::Ping::External` up to and including 0.15.
- The vulnerable package has been removed from Debian unstable, wheezy and jessie.
- The maintainer of the package acknowledges the vulnerability and provided a patch, but also indicates that they are not an active user and suggests transitioning the package to the Debian Perl Team.
