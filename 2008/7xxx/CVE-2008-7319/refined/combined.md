See forwarded message below. The reporter's proposed patch is also
attached.

The proposed patch seems to pretend to be a new upstream release, which
seems weird to me, but it isn't my patch.

For what it's worth, dak says nothing in unstable depends on this
package; so perhaps it's time to remove it from Debian.

Subject: [oss-security] Net::Ping::External command injections
Message-ID: <20171107165127.GA1693@weckbecker.name>

Hi,

Net::Ping::External [0] is prone to command injection vulnerabilities.

The issues are roughly 10 (!) years old [1], but the code is still being
shipped these days (e.g. in ubuntu artful and debian stretch [2]).

I had contacted the author of the code a few days ago, but obviously did
not get any reaction.

A patch is available here:

  <http://matthias.sdfeu.org/devel/net-ping-external-cmd-injection.patch>

Maybe time to just patch it downstream? Or drop this pkg. altogether?

Thanks,
Matthias

Control: retitle -1 libnet-ping-external-perl: [CVE-2008-7319](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-7319): command injection via crafted arguments

This issue got assigned [CVE-2008-7319](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-7319).

I have filled #881102 for requesting the removal from unstable.

For stretch and jessie I think the best course would be to have it
removed as well in the next point releases, given no package depends
on it.

Regards,
Salvatore

Hi

Considering that this package is about to be removed from jessie I
guess it should be removed from wheezy too. How is that done? Should I
contact the FTP maintainers about it, or do we simply ignore the
issue?

For people who wonder what we are discussing it is about [CVE-2008-7319](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-7319)

We don't have point releases, so I'm not sure we can get a package removed at
this stage without extra work by the ftp masters. So our options would be:

- mark as no-dsa if it's not important enough
- mark as unsupported / end-of-life
- fix it
- get it removed

The issue seems only exploitable if it's used by a service that is exposed
remotely or to other issues... and has no rdeps in wheezy. OTOH there is at
least one sponsor using that package. So removing it may not be the best course
given there is a proposed patch. So I'd go with either no-dsa or fix it,
depending on the assessed importance.

Cheers,
Emilio

Hi,

My apologies for taking a while to join the thread.  As the most recent
uploader of this package, I feel responsible for helping get it into a
safe state if we opt to keep it.  However, I am not an active user, so
if the package is to remain in Debian, it might be better to transition
it to the Debian Perl Team (assuming that is amenable to the team).

I tend to agree with Emilio that removing it might not be the best
course of action for our users, particularly given that we have a patch
and the popcon [1] is non-zero.  Removing it from the distribution seems
like it merely leaves users with a known vulnerability.  Also, the
package might be used in derivatives.

I agree with Simon that it's a little odd for the patch to bump the
version.  (OTOH, it makes it much easier to differentiate from the
vulnerable 0.15.)  Still, I am inclined to take the patch as a patch
against upstream 0.15 for the upload to unstable and then backport it
for 0.13 for stable and oldstable.  Or perhaps Alexandr Ciornii (on the
cc) would be willing to release 0.16 including the patch.

Thoughts?

Thank you,
tony

Hi Tony!

Thanks for your reply, dropping LTS list since reply is specific for
oldstable, stable and unstable.

The package is basically "unmaintained" (upstream)[*] and for almost
10 years did not address
<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=33230> (maybe you can
argue, as well a fault for various "downstreams" to not notice and
bring that earlier up, defintively. I wonder why only now it got
attention on oss-security, for which I then requested a CVE)

IMHO the best course of action is still to have it removed, in all
suites. For unstable, so that it's not included in buster. And for
oldstable and stable (as scheduled for the upcoming point releases)
via the point release announcements. The announcement will contain a
section which packages are removed from Debian, and for which reason,
so still users of Net::Ping::External are informed.

I agree as well that if one starts to argue that way that there are
old packages which do not see updates from upstream, then a whole more
should be removed from Debian ;-). My point was not this though, I'm
concernend that there was a bug with security implications for almost
10 years reported in public bugtracker, without even a reply to it to
acknowledge the problem.

Regards,
Salvatore

 [*] well not exactly, I know there was e.g. 0.15, so there is
     activity, but see remaining of sentence.

Hi Salvatore,

Understood.  I can appreciate all of the considerations that the
Security Team has to take into account regarding the distribution life
cycle.

I realize it won't be part of the announcement nor is it officially part
of Debian, but in case it helps any users of Net::Ping::External who
come across this bug report, I did prepare an updated package for 0.15
that includes the patch for [CVE-2008-7319](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-7319).

That packaging can be found here [1].

Cheers,
tony

Hi

I agree that it may not be the best to remove it then. I suggest we
mark it as no-dsa then. Any objections?

Hi again

After some more reading I think removing it should be ok anyway. I'll
change the wording from "will be removed" to "may be removed" to allow
us the freedom to keep it if nobody takes the action to actually
remove it.

Actually it got removed from wheezy in the mean time. Since it was
marked that way in dla-needed.txt, I pinged the ftp.d.o bug report and
pinged Chris Lamb (as ftp assistant) and the package is gone from wheezy:

$ rmadison libnet-ping-external-perl

Naturally, let me know if we should be removing anything else. :)

But I don't think thas worked as you might have expected, and it's not
really gone yet. While the dak rm works, there is no point release
mechanism for wheezy (LTS) and you still will find
libnet-ping-external-perl in the archive (and on the mirrors), as
there was not the usual procedure of removing the package, making a
new release, and pushing out the updates to the mirrors.

Salvatore

Indeed, you are right:
rhertzog@nas:/srv/debian/mirror/dists/wheezy/main/binary-i386$ zgrep libnet-ping-external-perl Packages.gz
Package: libnet-ping-external-perl
Filename: pool/main/libn/libnet-ping-external-perl/libnet-ping-external-perl_0.13-1_all.deb

The Packages* files have not been updated since June 4th 2016. Only the Release file
gets regular updates.

Maybe it's time to see what is required to be able to update wheezy... I don't
think there's any technical reason behind this behaviour. It's just policy that
we don't want to touch the Packages* files except during point releases.

Given the current LTS policies, I believe that we could have unannounced point
releases that do not increment any version number... as long as we just remove
some packages.

Chris or Thorsten, could you possibly look into what it involves and see whether
it's doable on the ftpmaster side ?

Cheers,

Another, easier option would be to declare these packages as unsupported
security-wise.

I pushed a commit into debian-security-support's git repo for this. But it
would still be nice to see what it involves to actually update the
Packages* files when we want to remove a source package.

Indeed. I had a poke but I'm afraid I'm not terribly «au fait»
with that part of dak and related infrastructure… Thorsten, do
you have any pointers or ideas?

Subject: Net::Ping::External command injections

Hi,

Net::Ping::External [0] is prone to command injection vulnerabilities.

The issues are roughly 10 (!) years old [1], but the code is still being
shipped these days (e.g. in ubuntu artful and debian stretch [2]).

I had contacted the author of the code a few days ago, but obviously did
not get any reaction.

A patch is available here:

  <http://matthias.sdfeu.org/devel/net-ping-external-cmd-injection.patch>

Maybe time to just patch it downstream? Or drop this pkg. altogether?

Thanks,
Matthias
