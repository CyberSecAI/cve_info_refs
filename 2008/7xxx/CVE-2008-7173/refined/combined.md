: Regarding the Jura F90 Coffee maker hack:
:
:   <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/493387>
:
: I'm tempted to include this in CVE, since physical damage can occur. (We
: used a similar rationale for an air-conditioning control system,
: CVE-2008-1546).
:
: If no - then where's the line between coffee makers, air conditioners,
: and SCADA products?

This is definitely worth inclusion in OSVDB in my eyes. If we can't draw
the line today, we will be able to in a year or years from now. At some
point, the blur between computing device and household appliance will be
too hard to distinguish. Rather than waste too much time arguing that
line, why not put in a few now that are a bit primitive, but will surely
show historic value if nothing else.
