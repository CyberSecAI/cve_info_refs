**CVE-2008-7218:**

The provided content describes a vulnerability related to privilege escalation in the Horde API, which is being addressed across multiple Horde products.

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is a flaw in the Horde API that allows for privilege escalation. The exact nature of the flaw isn't detailed, but it generally relates to how user access rights are validated or enforced within the API.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is a privilege escalation vulnerability within the Horde API itself. Additionally, there are issues with missing ownership validation on share changes.
