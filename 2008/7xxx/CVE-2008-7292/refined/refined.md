The provided content relates to two Bugzilla bugs: Bug 660502 (CVE-2011-2977) and Bug 414002.

**Bug 660502 (CVE-2011-2977) Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** A regression in Bugzilla 3.6 caused temporary files created during attachment uploads on Windows to not be deleted. This occurs because the `Bugzilla::CGI` object's `DESTROY` method does not call the parent `CGI::DESTROY` method, which is responsible for deleting temporary files. This regression was introduced after a change related to email notifications.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Failure to properly delete temporary files on Windows after an attachment upload.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A user with local access to the server could access temporary files in the Temp directory, including attachments uploaded to security bugs or private attachments.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Local file system access. An attacker with local access to the Bugzilla server could access the temporary directory where uploaded files are stored.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Local access to the Windows server hosting Bugzilla and knowledge of the temporary file path.
*   **Versions Affected**: Bugzilla versions 3.6, 3.7.1, 4.0.1, and 4.2.

**Bug 414002 Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `Bugzilla::CGI` class's `DESTROY` method was overriding the parent `CGI` class's `DESTROY` method which handles deletion of temp files on windows.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Failure to delete temporary files after upload on windows platform.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Temporary files left on the filesystem could be accessed by local users.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local file system access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Local access to the Bugzilla server.

**Summary of CVE-2011-2977:**

This content provides more details than the standard CVE description. It details the specific regression, affected versions, and how the fix was implemented. Specifically it gives the root cause being the failure of the `Bugzilla::CGI` object's `DESTROY` method to call the parent `CGI::DESTROY` method, which is responsible for deleting temporary files. This lead to a vulnerability where temporary attachment files were not being deleted on Windows, which allowed local users to potentially access uploaded attachments marked as private or attached to security bugs.
