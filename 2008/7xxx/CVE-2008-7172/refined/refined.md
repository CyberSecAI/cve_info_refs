Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Lightweight news portal (LNP) 1.0b, as described in the Exploit Database entry:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Weakness:** The application is vulnerable to XSS through the `show_photo.php` and `show_potd.php` scripts. These scripts do not properly sanitize user-provided input in the `photo` and `potd` parameters, allowing injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By crafting malicious URLs that include JavaScript code in the `photo` or `potd` parameters.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the attacker to craft the malicious links and lure the user to click on them.

*   **Insecure Administration:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Several administrative functions on `admin.php` can be accessed without a logged-in administrative session.
    *   **Vulnerable endpoints:**
         *  `admin.php?A=potd_delete`
         *  `admin.php?A=potd`
         *  `admin.php?A=vote_update`
         *   `admin.php?A=vote`
         *  `admin.php?A=modifynews`
    *   **Attack Vector:** Directly accessing the vulnerable admin pages without prior authentication.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can manipulate the website content (e.g., delete 'picture of the day', modify news, modify votes) without authentication.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote, no prior authentication is required.

*   **Permanent Code Injection (XSS):**
    *   **Weakness:** The "Current question" field in the voting functionality (`admin.php?A=vote`) allows for code injection. User-supplied input is not properly sanitized.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Current question" field which will then be displayed to all users viewing the poll.
    *   **Impact:**  All users browsing the poll will be exposed to the injected code. This allows for XSS attacks, potentially redirecting users, stealing session data, or executing other browser-based exploits.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires access to the vulnerable administrative function (which, due to the Insecure Administration vulnerability, can be accessed without prior authentication).

*   **File Upload:**
    *   **Weakness:** The "picture of the day" manager (`admin.php?A=potd`) allows file uploads but does not validate the file type.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can upload files other than images, potentially including source code.
    *   **Impact:** While direct execution of a PHP shell is not possible through this upload, an attacker can upload source files that can be used in further attacks, such as Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities if they exist elsewhere in the server.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires access to the vulnerable administrative function (which, due to the Insecure Administration vulnerability, can be accessed without prior authentication).

**Root Cause:**

*   Lack of input validation and sanitization
*   Insecure access control

**Summary:**

The application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to poor coding practices including lack of input validation and sanitization as well as a lack of access controls in the administration panel. An unauthenticated attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to inject malicious JavaScript, modify the website, and upload malicious files.
