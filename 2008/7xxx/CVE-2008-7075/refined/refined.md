    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_a7a59549_20250125_081824.html",
      "vulnerability": "Blind SQL injection vulnerability in Star Articles 6.0.",
      "description": "The provided code exploits a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the Star Articles application. The exploit works by injecting SQL queries into the 'artid' parameter of the 'article.download.php' script. It measures the response length of the page to determine if the SQL query is true or false, thus extracting information from the database.",
      "attack_vector": "HTTP GET request with crafted SQL injection payloads in the 'artid' parameter of the 'article.download.php' script.",
        "impact": "An attacker can extract sensitive data, such as user passwords, by injecting SQL queries to retrieve data from the database.",
      "weakness": "The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input, allowing SQL injection.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application."

      "vulnerability": "Blind SQL injection vulnerability in Star Articles 6.0.",
      "description": "Multiple pages within the Star Articles application are vulnerable to blind SQL injection. This is demonstrated using 'article.download.php' by injecting SQL into the `artid` parameter. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries by manipulating parameters to retrieve database information.",
      "attack_vector": "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP scripts with SQL injection in parameters like `artid`.",
      "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized data retrieval and potentially full database compromise.",
      "weakness": "The application is vulnerable due to inadequate sanitization of user supplied input allowing the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication needed."
