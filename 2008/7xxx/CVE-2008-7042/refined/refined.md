The provided content relates to CVE-2008-7042.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from two distinct issues within the "fresh email script" versions 1.0 to 1.11:
1.  **File Inclusion:** The script is vulnerable to remote file inclusion via the `tmp_sid` parameter in `url.php`.
2.  **Cookie Manipulation:**  The script allows manipulation of cookies via custom HTTP headers or META tag injection in `register.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Unfiltered GET parameter:** The `tmp_sid` GET parameter in `url.php` is not properly sanitized allowing the inclusion of arbitrary local and remote files.
2.  **Lack of input sanitization:** The `register.php` does not sanitize the input allowing for custom HTTP headers or META tags to be injected, which can manipulate the cookies.
3.  **Insecure Session Handling:** The application does not provide a new session ID after every login.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **File Inclusion:** Remote attackers can include local or remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the web server.
2. **Cookie Manipulation:** An attacker can modify cookies leading to session fixation attacks. This allows an attacker to predetermine a user's session ID before they log in.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **File Inclusion:** Sending a crafted GET request to `url.php` with the `tmp_sid` parameter pointing to a malicious file or URL.
2.  **Cookie Manipulation:** Injecting a custom HTTP header or META tag with a `Set-cookie` directive into the `register.php` form submission, specifically through the Email parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **File Inclusion:** Remote attacker with the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and hosting the malicious file or having access to a file on the target server.
2.  **Cookie Manipulation:** Remote attacker with the ability to manipulate the form submission to `register.php`, typically via a web browser.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability affects versions 1.0 to 1.11 of the "Fresh Email Script".
- The exploit also mentions that the vendor was not notified.
- The exploit suggests filtering the output to prevent the injection of custom HTTP headers or META tags, and generating new session IDs with each login.
