The provided content describes a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability found in Firefox, Opera, and Chrome, which the author calls "DoS via printing (printing DoS attack)". This vulnerability is triggered when a specific HTML file is opened in the browser.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is related to how the browsers handle the printing functionality when processing a specially crafted HTML file. The specific details of how the HTML file triggers the vulnerability is not explained.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness lies in the browser's rendering/processing engine and its inability to handle specific print-related commands or structures within HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Firefox:** The browser freezes, making it unusable.
*   **Opera and Chrome:** The browsers become unresponsive and can only be closed via the Task Manager.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through an HTML file that, when opened, triggers the vulnerability in the browser, likely when initiating the print functionality.
*   An attacker would likely have to get the user to load the malicious HTML file through some means (e.g., social engineering).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to host a malicious HTML file.
*   The attacker needs to lure the victim to open the malicious file with a vulnerable browser.

The article provides links to the exploit HTML files for each browser (Firefox, Opera, and Chrome). It also mentions that Internet Explorer 7 is vulnerable to the same attack.
