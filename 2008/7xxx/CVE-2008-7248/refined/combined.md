How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Form Data Encoding Roundup

In an HTML [form](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.3)
element,
the [*enctype*](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#adef-enctype)
attribute specifies how the data will be encoded when it is POSTed to the web server.
Traditionally, there are two accepted content types for HTML
forms:

* application/x-www-form-urlencoded (the default value)
* multipart/form-data

But there is nothing to stop someone from specifying whatever
*enctype* value that they want (e.g., "application/x-foo"). Of
course specifying your own random value doesn't mean that the browser
will understand how to submit it or the web server will understand
how to process it.

The following lists how some popular browsers respond to
unexpected but technically valid enctype values. Each of the [MIME types](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/)
from this [list](/resource/web-browsers/inline%3A/form-data-encoding-roundup/mime-types.txt) was tested.
The following browsers were tested:

* [Safari - Mac OS X](#Safari-Mac-OS-X)
* [Safari - Windows](#Safari-Windows)
* [Konqueror - Linux](#Konqueror-Linux)
* [Mozilla Firefox - Mac OS X](#Mozilla-Firefox-Mac-OS-X)
* [Mozilla Firefox - Windows](#Mozilla-Firefox-Windows)
* [Mozilla Firefox - Linux](#Mozilla-Firefox-Linux)
* [Opera - Mac OS X](#Opera-Mac-OS-X)
* [Opera - Windows](#Opera-Windows)
* [Opera - Linux](#Opera-Linux)
* [Internet Explorer
  7 - Windows](#Internet-Explorer-7-Windows)
* [Internet Explorer 6 - Windows](#Internet-Explorer-6-Windows)
* [Internet Explorer

### Conclusions

As expected, all of the browsers properly support
'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' and 'multipart/form-data'
content-type values for the form element's enctype attribute.
Additionally, Microsoft Internet Explorer (versions 6 and 7), Mozilla Firefox and
Opera support a content-type value of 'text/plain'. The form
values are submitted without any encoding or MIME boundary.

Safari and Konqueror exhibit the most idiosyncratic behavior.
Both apply a heuristic to determine the proper content-type based on the
enctype value by checking for the strings "multipart",
"form-data", "text" and "plain". Any enctype that contains
"multipart" or "form-data" is treated as 'multipart/form-data'.
If "text" or "plain" are found, then the content-type is set to
'text/plain' but the form contents are still urlencoded. An
examination of the source code shows the origins of the behavior.

From the [KDE
source](http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/), "[kdelibs/khtml/html/html\_formimpl.cpp](http://websvn.kde.org/%2Acheckout%2A/trunk/KDE/kdelibs/khtml/html/html_formimpl.cpp?revision=712622&content-type=text%2Fplain)"
contains the following:

```

void HTMLFormElementImpl::setEnctype( const DOMString& type )
{
    if(type.string().indexOf("multipart", 0, Qt::CaseInsensitive) != -1 || type.string().indexOf("form-data", 0, Qt::CaseInsensitive) != -1)
    {
        m_enctype = "multipart/form-data";
        m_multipart = true;
        m_post = true;
    } else if (type.string().indexOf("text", 0, Qt::CaseInsensitive) != -1 || type.string().indexOf("plain", 0, Qt::CaseInsensitive) != -1)
    {
        m_enctype = "text/plain";
        m_multipart = false;
    }
    else
    {
        m_enctype = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";
        m_multipart = false;
    }
    m_encCharset.clear();
}

```

And from "[kdelibs/khtml/khtml\_part.cpp](http://websvn.kde.org/%2Acheckout%2A/trunk/KDE/kdelibs/khtml/khtml_part.cpp?revision=720189&content-type=text%2Fplain)":

```

    // construct some user headers if necessary
    if (contentType.isNull() || contentType == "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
      browserArgs.setContentType( "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" );
    else // contentType must be "multipart/form-data"
      browserArgs.setContentType( "Content-Type: " + contentType + "; boundary=" + boundary );

```

From the [WebKit
source](http://trac.webkit.org/projects/webkit/browser/trunk), "[WebCore/html/HTMLFormElement.cpp](http://trac.webkit.org/projects/webkit/browser/trunk/WebCore/html/HTMLFormElement.cpp?format=txt&rev=25754)"
contains:

```

void HTMLFormElement::parseEnctype(const String& type)
{
    if(type.contains("multipart", false) || type.contains("form-data", false)) {
        m_enctype = "multipart/form-data";
        m_multipart = true;
    } else if (type.contains("text", false) || type.contains("plain", false)) {
        m_enctype = "text/plain";
        m_multipart = false;
    } else {
        m_enctype = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";
        m_multipart = false;
    }
}

```

And from "[WebCore/loader/FrameLoader.cpp](http://trac.webkit.org/projects/webkit/browser/trunk/WebCore/loader/FrameLoader.cpp?format=txt&rev=25783)":

```

        // construct some user headers if necessary
        if (contentType.isNull() || contentType == "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
            frameRequest.resourceRequest().setHTTPContentType(contentType);
        else // contentType must be "multipart/form-data"
            frameRequest.resourceRequest().setHTTPContentType(contentType + "; boundary=" + boundary);

```
### Further Research

The form element also supports an [*accept-charset*](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#adef-accept-charset)
attribute. Additional research may be warranted to determine if different
values affect how the data content is encoded and submitted.

### Source Scripts

The following scripts were used. There are provided in the hope that
they may be useful for someone:

* [mime-chucker.cgi](/resource/web-browsers/form-data-encoding-roundup/mime-chucker.cgi%3Ainline)
* [gen-sample.cgi](/resource/web-browsers/form-data-encoding-roundup/gen-sample.cgi%3Ainline)

Hi,

a little blast from the past, I think this issue does not have a CVE
yet. If that is true, please assign a -2008 ID.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can

the effectiveness of the CSRF protection given by
protect\_from\_forgery.

By design rails does not does not perform token verification on
requests with certain content types not typically generated by
browsers. Unfortunately this list also included 'text/plain' which
can be generated by browsers.

Impact
======

Requests can be crafted which will circumvent the CSRF protection
entirely. Rails does not parse the parameters provided with these
requests, but that may not be enough to protect your application.

Affected Versions
======

\* All releases in the 2.1 series
\* All 2.2 Pre Releases

Fixes
======

\* 2.1.3 and 2.2.2 will contain a fix for this issue.

Interim Workarounds
======

Users of 2.1.x releases are advised to insert the following code into
a file in config/initializers/

Mime::Type.unverifiable\_types.delete(:text)

Users of Edge Rails after 2.2.1, should upgrade to the latest code in
2-2-stable.

The patch for the 2.1.x series is available at:

<http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/099a98e9b7108dae3e0f78b207e0a7dc5913bd1a>

This will also apply cleanly to 2.2 pre-releases prior to the
following changeset:

commit f1ad8b48aae3ee26613b3e77bc0056e120096846
Author: Michael Koziarski <mic...@koziarski.com>
Date: Thu Nov 13 11:19:53 2008 +0100

Users with edge-rails checkouts after that date, are advised to
upgrade to the latest code in 2-2-stable.

# Circumvent Rails CSRF Protection

 Filed under [Uncategorized](https://rorsecurity.info/journal/category/uncategorized)

There is a security-related bug in Ruby on Rails 2.1.x and all 2.2. pre-releases. The CSRF protection given by

the protect\_from\_forgery method may possibly be circumvented by a crafted request.

The problem is that Rails by design will not check the [authenticity token](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#_csrf_countermeasures) if the request has certain content types that are typically not generated by browsers. According to the [original security message](http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/d741ee286e36e301?hl=en), this list also includes “text/plain” which may be generated by browsers. This [form data encoding roundup](http://pseudo-flaw.net/content/web-browsers/form-data-encoding-roundup/) gives an overview of what can be generated by today’s browsers. See [this changset](http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/099a98e9b7108dae3e0f78b207e0a7dc5913bd1a) for details of which content types will be checked.

## Possible Exploit

The content type can be set with the enctype attribute in HTML forms:

<form method=”post” enctype=”text/plain” action=”<%= some\_post\_action\_path(@var) %>”><%= submit\_tag “Start” %></form>

This was found in this [Lighthouse ticket](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1145-bug-invalidauthenticitytoken-incorrectly-raised-for-xml-controllerdestroy-request#ticket-1145-29). The [original security message](http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/d741ee286e36e301?hl=en) states that Rails does not parse the parameters for these requests. However, I was able to craft requests where all parameters where correctly parsed and used.

## Temporary Solution

Users of 2.1.x releases are advised to insert the following code into a file in config/initializers/

Mime::Type.unverifiable\_types.delete(:text)

Or you apply [this patch](http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/099a98e9b7108dae3e0f78b207e0a7dc5913bd1a) for the 2.1.x releases. Users of Edge Rails should upgrade to the latest version.

## Fixes

Fixes will be in Rails version [2.1.3 and 2.2.2](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/milestones).
