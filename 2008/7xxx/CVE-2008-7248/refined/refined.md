Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-7248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Ruby on Rails' CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection mechanism. The framework was designed to skip CSRF token verification for requests with certain content types, assuming these are not typically generated by browsers. However, the list of skipped content types inadvertently included `text/plain`, which *can* be generated by browsers, leading to a bypass of the CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Bypass:** The core issue is the ability to bypass Rails' built-in CSRF protection. By submitting requests with a `text/plain` content type, an attacker could circumvent the usual token verification checks.
*   **Insufficient Content Type Validation:** The vulnerability highlights a flaw in the way Rails handled content types for requests. It incorrectly assumed that `text/plain` was always a non-browser-generated type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CSRF Attacks:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform CSRF attacks. This means an attacker can trick a user's browser into making requests to a Rails application on their behalf, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as account changes, data manipulation, or other harmful operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTML Forms:** Attackers can create malicious HTML forms with the `enctype` attribute set to `text/plain`. When a victim is tricked into submitting this form, the request bypasses the CSRF protection.
*   **Browser Exploitation:** The vulnerability relies on the fact that browsers can generate `text/plain` content types. The attacker is not exploiting a browser vulnerability but rather leveraging browser functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTML forms and entice victims to interact with them.
*   **No Direct Access to Server:** The attacker doesn't require direct access to the vulnerable Rails server.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a victim into submitting the malicious form.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects all Ruby on Rails 2.1.x versions and 2.2 pre-releases.
*   Fixes were released in versions 2.1.3 and 2.2.2.
*   A temporary workaround for 2.1.x users was to remove `:text` from the `Mime::Type.unverifiable_types` list.
*   While Rails does not parse parameters with `text/plain` content type, it was discovered that parameters *were* still correctly parsed, making it a viable attack vector.
*   Browsers such as Safari and Konqueror were identified as having unique behavior in how they handle the enctype attribute in forms.

**In Summary**

CVE-2008-7248 is a CSRF bypass vulnerability in Ruby on Rails caused by incorrect content type handling, specifically, the inclusion of "text/plain" in the list of non-CSRF protected content types. This allows attackers to craft malicious requests that bypass the built-in CSRF protection mechanism.
