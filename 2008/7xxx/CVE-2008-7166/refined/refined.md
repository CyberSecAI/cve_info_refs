{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of the Range header in HTTP requests within the web UI.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The software does not properly manage the Range header during web UI requests."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote crash of the uTorrent/BitTorrent client.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a series of HTTP requests with an increasing Range header via the web UI."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the client with the web UI enabled.",
    "more_details": "The vulnerability leads to memory access violations after approximately 40 malicious requests. This occurs because the application does not properly manage the memory allocations associated with the range requests, eventually leading to an attempt to write outside the allocated memory space, and crashing the process. The vulnerability affects BitTorrent clients and uTorrent clients because they use the same code base. "
