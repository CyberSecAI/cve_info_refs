Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-7090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input (GPC variables) before being used in SQL queries or file handling operations. This lack of input validation is a common weakness leading to several vulnerability types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Unsanitized user-supplied input is directly passed to the Smarty template engine, allowing for injection of malicious JavaScript code. Specifically, the `keyword` parameter in `user.php` is vulnerable.
*   **Arbitrary File Access/Inclusion:**
    *   **File Enumeration:** The `trackback.php` script uses `file_get_contents()` on a URL provided by the user without proper validation, allowing an attacker to check if arbitrary files exist on the server.
    *   **File Inclusion:**  The `template` parameter in `settemplate.php` accepts a file path from cookie input and uses it directly for file inclusion without sanitization, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary files on the server.
*  **SQL Injection:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of sanitization of user-provided input before being used in database queries. These are found in various files, including:
    * `vote.php` (via the `id` parameter)
    *   `trackback.php` (via the `tb_id` parameter)
    *   `submit.php`
    *   `story.php` (via the `requestTitle` variable)
    *   `recommend.php` (via `requestID` and `requestTitle`)
    *   `cloud.php` (via `categoryID` parameter)
    *   `out.php` (via the `title` parameter)
    *  `login.php` (via `username` parameter)
    *  `cvote.php` (via `id` parameter)
    *  `edit.php` (via `commentid` parameter)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Cookie theft, leading to account hijacking.
*   **Arbitrary File Access/Inclusion:** Arbitrary file reading, and potentially arbitrary code execution. The ability to include arbitrary files can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by including PHP code placed within a template file.
*   **SQL Injection:**  Extraction of sensitive data from the database, including user credentials (usernames and passwords), leading to unauthorized access and further compromise of the system. Gaining admin credentials through SQLi leads to remote code execution via manipulation of template files.
*  **Remote Code Execution:** By combining the different vulnerabilities, an attacker can gain admin access and then inject malicious php code in template files, resulting in remote code execution on the affected installation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** Sending a crafted URL to a victim or injecting the malicious script into a page visited by other users.
*  **Arbitrary File Access/Inclusion:**  Sending crafted requests with manipulated parameters such as tb_url and template to the vulnerable endpoints.
*  **SQL Injection:** Sending crafted requests (both GET and POST) with malicious SQL queries to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities to obtain admin credentials, an attacker can then inject malicious php code in template files and achieve remote code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Pligg CMS installation.
*   For SQL injection and file inclusion, no authentication is required initially to exploit these flaws, though gaining admin credentials expands the attack surface to arbitrary code execution by exploiting template functionalities.
*   For XSS attacks, the attacker can use social engineering to trick a user to click a malicious link, or inject XSS through other vulnerabilities in the application.
