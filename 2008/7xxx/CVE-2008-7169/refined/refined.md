- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Joomla! component `jabode` is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `index.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection. The `id` parameter within the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or gain control over the underlying system. In this specific case, the example provided extracts the username and password from the `jos_users` table.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface, specifically through the `index.php` script using the `com_jabode` component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special position or capabilities are required other than access to the target system through the web.
