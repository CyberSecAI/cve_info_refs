```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses a flawed SQL query in login.php, which is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user input in the SQL query.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the system.
- Attack vectors: Sending a malicious crafted SQL payload (' or '1=1) via the user ID or password fields.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the login form of the web application.
