```
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way the application handles the 's' parameter via the $_GET array. Specifically, the script attempts to filter the 's' parameter, allowing only uppercase letters from A to Z. However, if the parameter is not a single uppercase letter, it is removed using unset(), which does not prevent SQL Injection as the parameter can be manipulated in other ways.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection. The flawed input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the `s` parameter. The use of `unset()` to remove invalid parameters is insufficient to prevent this vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or deletion. In the given example, the attacker extracts user information (id, username, password, email) from the `ac_users` table.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `s` parameter. The injection is performed via the `directory.php?s=` parameter in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application. No special privileges or access is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques.
