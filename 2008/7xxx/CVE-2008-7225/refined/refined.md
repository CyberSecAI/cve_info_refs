- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap overflows due to insufficient bounds checking when handling telnet options and SSH packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **A] telnet option heap overflow**: The server doesn't properly handle telnet options longer than 260 bytes, leading to a heap overflow.
    - **B] SSH packet heap overflow**: The server is vulnerable to a heap overflow when processing large SSH packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution is possible due to heap overflow vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending telnet options longer than 260 bytes to the server (A).
    - Sending large SSH packets to the server (B).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker can exploit the vulnerabilities.
