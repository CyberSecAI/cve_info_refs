  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing local file inclusion.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities exist in various scripts due to insufficient input validation. The `link` parameter in `module.php` is vulnerable even after a patch intended to prevent remote file inclusion. Other scripts in modules such as diary, gallery, reviews, and news are also affected if `register_globals` is enabled, allowing injection via parameters like `rootdp`, `gsLanguage`, `language_home`, `admin_home`, and `nLink`.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information, execution of arbitrary PHP code if the included file contains such code, or denial of service.  If combined with other vulnerabilities, remote code execution may be possible.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vectors involve manipulating HTTP GET or POST parameters.  Specifically, the `link` parameter in `module.php` and parameters such as `rootdp`, `gsLanguage`, `language_home`, `admin_home` and `nLink` in the other affected scripts are vulnerable.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. For most vulnerabilities, no authentication is required. Some vulnerabilities are only exploitable if `register_globals` is enabled on the server."
