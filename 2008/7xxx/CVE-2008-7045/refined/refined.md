The content is related to CVE-2008-7045.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `newpoll.php` script, specifically within the `$ques` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Blind SQL Injection:** The `newpoll.php` script is vulnerable to blind SQL injection through the `ques` parameter.  The script directly uses the unsanitized `$ques` variable in a SQL query.
2.  **Lack of proper access control:** The `resetvote.php` script can be called directly to reset votes without any authentication, which can be considered a vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Blind SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials or other application data. This is achieved by crafting SQL injection payloads in the `ques` parameter, and observing the application's response (or lack of response).
2.  **Resetting Votes:** An attacker could reset votes on polls.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **Blind SQL Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload within the `ques` parameter of the URL of the `newpoll.php` script.
2.  **Resetting Votes:** Accessing the `resetvote.php` script via a direct URL request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  **Blind SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
2.  **Resetting Votes:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
