- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `report()` function of the xtacacsd TACACS server due to the use of `vsprintf` to write to a fixed-size buffer `msg`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Buffer overflow: The `vsprintf` function can write more data into the `msg` buffer than it can hold (256 bytes) if the format string and arguments passed to it result in a larger string.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Remote code execution is possible since the overflow occurs in a server process.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Remote: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the server that leads to the `report()` function being called with a format string that will generate a string larger than 256 bytes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the xtacacsd server and send a specifically crafted request that triggers the vulnerable `report()` function with overflowing input.
