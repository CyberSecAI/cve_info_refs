How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=543619#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-12-02 18:16:21 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2008-7247](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-7247) to the following vulnerability:  sql/sql_table.cc in MySQL 5.0.x through 5.0.88, 5.1.x through 5.1.41, and 6.0 before 6.0.9-alpha, when the data home directory contains a symlink to a different filesystem, allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by calling CREATE TABLE with a (1) DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY argument referring to a subdirectory that requires following this symlink.  References: ----------- <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-7247> <http://lists.mysql.com/commits/59711> <http://marc.info/?l=oss-security&m=125908040022018&w=2> <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39277>  Upstream patch: --------------- <http://lists.mysql.com/commits/59711>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=543619#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-12-02 18:21:35 UTC  ``` This issue does NOT affect the versions of the mysql package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, or 5.  This issue does NOT affect the version of the mysql package, as shipped with Fedora release of 10.  This issue affects the versions of the mysql package, as shipped with Fedora release of 11 and 12.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=543619#c3)  Tom Lane    2009-12-02 18:23:30 UTC  ``` So how would a symlink get in there?  This doesn't seem like a serious problem at first glance.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=543619#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2009-12-03 15:48:35 UTC  ``` Can anyone help me understand what issue is really referred to using this CVE?  This is the description from MySQL changelogs:    When the data directory contained a symbolic link to another file   system, and the DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY clause of a CREATE   TABLE statement referred to a subdirectory of the data directory,   this was accepted, when for security reasons it should be rejected.  I don't yet see a reason why "another file system" is relevant here, it seems any symlink out of datadir should do.  Otherwise, I read that description as: - /var/lib/mysql contains a symlink e.g. foo pointing out of /var/lib/mysql - /var/lib/mysql/foo is used as DATA or INDEX DIRECTORY for CREATE TABLE - table creation is allowed while reject is expected  I'm not sure if the expectation is correct, given that realpath will return a path without symlinks which is out of datadir (/var/lib/mysql).  Anyway, this like an odd corner case that can only be hit if the symlink is created manually.   However, that description does not seem to match the initial description of the upstream bug, or the description of the upstream commit:    <http://lists.mysql.com/commits/91835>  +      data_file_name and index_file_name include the table name without +      extension. Mostly this does not refer to an existing file. When +      comparing data_file_name or index_file_name against the data +      directory, we try to resolve all symbolic links. On some systems, +      we use realpath(3) for the resolution. This returns ENOENT if the +      resolved path does not refer to an existing file. my_realpath() +      does then copy the requested path verbatim, without symlink +      resolution. Thereafter the comparison can fail even if the +      requested path is within the data directory.  My testing with 5.0.77 (EL5) shows that data_file_name / index_file_name does *not* contain the table name when they are passed to test_if_data_home_dir(), table name is only appended after.  The code does look different in 5.1.x (and possibly later), but if test_if_data_home_dir() is called with parameter including table name, that should be a complete regression of [CVE-2008-4098](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-4098) fix in those versions.   Upstream bug also points out another interesting case, which does not seem to be addressed via the mentioned upstream patch - test case #2 in:    <http://bugs.mysql.com/file.php?id=10707&text=1>  which allows user with CREATE/DROP privileges to any database to destroy tables in any other database using something like:    mkdir /tmp/bad   mysql> create table somedb.user (c1 int) data directory '/tmp/bad'          index directory '/tmp/bad';   rm -rf /tmp/bad   ln -s /var/lib/mysql/mysql /tmp/bad   mysql> drop table somedb.user;  This does seem to work fine on 5.0.77.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=543619#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2009-12-04 14:39:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=543619#c4)) > My testing with 5.0.77 (EL5) shows that data_file_name / index_file_name does > *not* contain the table name when they are passed to test_if_data_home_dir(), > table name is only appended after.

I did a re-test with 5.1.39 (F12) and test_if_data_home_dir() does indeed get called with table name without extension appended to the user-supplied path.  This sounds like a regression on [CVE-2008-4098](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-4098) to me and has nothing to do with symlinks inside the datadir, as any symlink will do (like /tmp/evil -> /var/lib/mysql/mysql).  But 5.1.39 does not allow overwriting of existing database files.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=543619#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2009-12-21 09:38:29 UTC  ``` Note: this is not fixed in 5.1.41.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=543619#c12)  Tom Lane    2010-01-08 22:03:43 UTC  ``` Per [bug #553653](show_bug.cgi?id=553653), we've now disabled symlinks by default for F13 and EL6.  This doesn't fix the vulnerability for existing installations, but it should at least reduce our exposure to this type of issue in future.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=543619#c15)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-29 23:17:00 UTC  ``` mysql-5.1.42-7.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/mysql-5.1.42-7.fc12>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=543619#c16)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-29 23:17:05 UTC  ``` mysql-5.1.42-7.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/mysql-5.1.42-7.fc11>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=543619#c17)  Fedora Update System    2010-02-02 01:06:41 UTC  ``` mysql-5.1.42-7.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

Hi Josh,

   looked further into these issues.

A, wrt <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32167>

You are right, that  CVE-2008-2079 was originally assigned to:
    <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32167>

On "[6 May 2008 11:16] Sergei Golubchik" states:

please, note in the manual that it's CVE-2008-2079

But last comment on this bug mentions:

<quote>

[12 Nov 4:50] Paul DuBois

Noted in 5.1.41, 5.5.0, 6.0.14 changelogs.

Additional corrections were made for the symlink-related privilege
problem originally addressed in MySQL 5.1.24. The original fix did
not correctly handle the data directory path name if it contained
symlinked directories in its path, and the check was made only at
table-creation time, not at table-opening time later.

</quote>

Also MySQL-5.1.41 news file now contains:

Important Change: Security Fix: Additional
corrections were made for the symlink-related
privilege problem originally addressed in MySQL
5.1.24. The original fix did not correctly handle
the data directory path name if it contained
symlinked directories in its path, and the check
was made only at table-creation time, not at
table-opening time later. (Bug#32167, CVE-2008-2079)"

Consequence:
===========

So I think we will need a new CVE id as incomplete fix for CVE-2009-2079.
Relevant patch is here (2845 Georgi Kodinov	2009-11-03)
   <http://lists.mysql.com/commits/89940>

Cc-ed MySQL security team to confirm this assumption.

B, wrt to <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39277>

   This is potential security issue, but the proposed patch didn't
made it neither into 5.0.88, nor into 5.1.41 releases.
In fact it was committed only to 6.0.9-alpha release
("Pushed into 6.0.9-alpha" comment from that bug).
So we will need to wait a little bit for patch "stabilization".

Conclusion - so two CVE ids are needed:
---------------------------------------
1, One for incomplete fix for CVE-2009-2079 issue) --
    "and the check was made only at table-creation time, not at table-opening time later"

      <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32167>
      <http://lists.mysql.com/commits/89940>

2, The second one for the "MySQL clients linked against OpenSSL did not check
    server certificates presented by a server linked against yaSSL" issue

      <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47320>

Sergei, please confirm / disprove the above.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

Description:
I do not know, why this doesn't fail in pushbuild.
But to be cautious, I added my exact system specification.

main.symlink                   [ fail ]

mysqltest: At line 199: query 'CREATE TABLE t1(a INT)
INDEX DIRECTORY='$MYSQLTEST_VARDIR/master-data/mysql'' succeeded - should have failed with errno 1210...

The result from queries just before the failure was:
< snip >
select * from t1;
a
9
select * from t1;
a
99
select * from t1;
a
42
drop table t1;
End of 4.1 tests
SET SESSION keep_files_on_create = TRUE;
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT) ENGINE MYISAM;
Got one of the listed errors
SET SESSION keep_files_on_create = FALSE;
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT) ENGINE MYISAM;
DROP TABLE t1;
End of 5.0 tests
CREATE TABLE t1(a INT)
INDEX DIRECTORY='TEST_DIR/master-data/mysql';

How to repeat:
OS: Debian GNU/Linux/x86_64
OS: Debian Sid kernel 2.6.26  SMP PREEMPT
gcc (Debian 4.3.1-8) 4.3.1

bzr branch bzr+ssh://bk-internal.mysql.com/bzrroot/server/mysql-5.1/ mysql-5.1-main
cd mysql-5.1-main
BUILD/compile-pentium64-debug-max --with-debug=full
cd mysql-test
./mysql-test-run.pl symlink

Suggested fix:
On my system, realpath(3) returns ENOENT on $MYSQLTEST_VARDIR/master-data/mysql/t1. The table is to be created and does not exist yet. realpath(3) copies nothing in the result buffer. Hence is doesn't compare equal to the mysqld home directory.

For me this fixed it:

Can't repeat with 5.1.30 on 32-bit SuSE with 2.6.11.4-20a non-SMP kernel, so this is definitely a platfrom-specific problem.

I did a fresh branch from mysql-5.1. It still happens on my machine.

The system specification is correct as far as I can tell. I am using Debian unstable, which is called Sid AFAIK. About once a month I use to dist-upgrade. Last time on 7. September. Uname -a is:
Linux stella 2.6.26 #1 SMP PREEMPT Sun Sep 7 16:15:18 CEST 2008 x86_64 GNU/Linux
After the mentioned dist-upgrade, the compiler version is now gcc version 4.3.2 (Debian 4.3.2-1).

Since I seem to be the only one with the problem, you may set it back to "need feedback" and let it close automatically.

If I find some time, I'll dig deeper and compare with another system on the debug level.
```

[16 Sep 2008 11:19]
Ingo Strüwing

Since nobody but me could repeat it, I dug deeper and found the probable cause:

On my machine, I have a tmpfs on /tmp. I want to speed the test by running it there. But I don't want to copy the whole work tree there.

So I create a directory under /tmp and link it symbolically to mysql-test/var.

mysqld correctly evaluates it's real data home dir as /tmp/...
The create table statement tries to figure out if the requested path for the table file (including the table base name, but incomprehensibly no extension) lies inside the data home dir. On my machine realpath(3) does not find the path and gives back ENOENT (no such file). my_realpath() then copies the requested path verbatim. test_if_data_home_dir() does then conclude that the path starting with $HOME/... (where the test runs) does not match the real data home dir (/tmp/...). Hence it happily succeeds and creates the table. The expected error does not happen, so the test case fails.

My suggested fix, to strip off the table base name, makes realpath(3) find the file (the directory in this case) and return the real path, starting as /tmp/. The following compare in test_if_data_home_dir() does then match positively with the real data home dir. Error 1210 is reported as expected. The test case then succeeds.

      [Bug#39277](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39277) - symlink.test fails on Debian

      When the data directory contained a symbolic link to another
      file system, and the DATA or INDEX DIRECTORY clause of a
      CREATE TABLE statement referred to a subdirectory of the data
      directory, this was accepted.

      The problem was the use of a table file path name, which included
      the table name without an extension, for the comparison against
      the data directory path name. This was almost always a
      non-existent file. The internal algorithm failed to resolve
      symbolic links for non-existent files. So we compared unrelated
      path names.

      Fixed by truncating the table name from the path before resolving
      symlinks.

Please re-triage this for version 5.1. This bug is very annoying in every development environment where one has the test directory symlinked to a memory file system. It makes every run of the test suite fail.

Also one can suspect that there could be a security risk connected to the problem.

I have been told that this is not a security issue. I agree that I did
not find a way to get at other user's data or to modify them. However,
it might be arguable if denial of service is a security issue.

I am pretty sad that I am not allowed to fix it.

Problems with symbolic links
============================

Nomenclature
------------

'file' in this document means engine files, in particular .MYD and
       .MYI, but not .frm files.

'datadir' is the MySQL server's data home directory, in which the
          databases reside in form of directories.

'in datadir' is in one of the database directories in datadir.
             When/if we do checks, we also include the data home
             directory itself and arbitrarily deep stacked
             subdirectories of it.

'with[out] symlinks' tables that are created or altered with a
                     {DATA|INDEX} DIRECTORY clause use symbolic
                     links to point at their files.
                     If datadir itself is a symlinked path,
                     some of the below problems could apply to
                     all tables that have their files in datadir.
                     But this is not the main topic here.

Summary
-------

Using symbolic links you cannot:

- Open tables, which files are symlinked into datadir.
  This prevents access to data of tables in datadir,
  other than through the normal path with privilege checking.
  No read or write of other user's data is possible.

- Create tables that use existing files.

- Prevent creation of a table that does not use symlinks.
  Create table without symlink does not care about existing files.

Using symbolic links you can:

- Create tables with their files in datadir.
  But you cannot open them. See above.

- Drop tables with their files in datadir.
  This can make a DoS attack if the table was created with
  symlinks before a table without symlinks uses the same files.

- Drop every existing table in datadir with just CREATE and DROP
  privilege in an arbitrary database, filesystem access
  somewhere on the server machine, and read access to the data
  home directory itself.
  This can also make a DoS attack. After creation of a directory
  somewhere outside of datadir, and creation of a table with the
  same name as the "target" table, one could remove the files and
  directory, and replace the directory with a symbolic link to
  the "target" database. Dropping the table would remove the files
  of the "target" table.

Comments
--------

The initial bug report was about a failing test case. It turned out to
happen due to the problem that symlinked tables can have their files
in datadir, while the test case assumes they cannot.

This is not a big deal as this fact in itself does not hurt. A such
created table cannot be opened and cannot prevent another table with the
same name to be created. So we could even change the test case so that
it accepts success for symlinked tables as well as failure for
non-symlinked tables. But I fear that I won't be allowed to push even
this fix.

Since this doesn't seem to be the real problem any more, and as it
doesn't happen on Debian only, I changed the synopsis.

The big problem for me is that every run of a test suite fails in my
environment due to this problem. This prevents me to combine several
builds and tests in a script as I cannot continue automatically with a
failure. Detecting and excluding the symlink test case seems difficult
and error prone. The only feasible way is to abstain from symlinking
mysql-test/var into a temporary file system. Unfortunately this
increases the testing time from 1h40min to 2h20min on my machine. :-(

Anyway, during my investigation, I stumbled over a, say, unpleasant
behavior of DROP TABLE. It does not seem to check if the table is
symlinked into datadir. So it happily removes the table files, even from
other tables in datadir.

For the curious I'll attach a test file that supports my findings.

I was in error regarding the requirements for dropping any table. It is not required to have read access to the data home directory of the server to set a symbolic link to a database directory. One can create a symbolic link with arbitrary contents. One just needs to know the path. But one does not need to have any access to it. The server process, which has access to the full path to the database directories can use that link, if the path is correct.

So the fixed capability statement for symlinked tables is this:

- Drop every (any) existing table in datadir with just CREATE and DROP
  privilege in an arbitrary database and filesystem write access
  somewhere on the server machine, e.g. in /tmp.
```

I received approval from Lars Thalmann to push it into 6.0.

The reviewers agreed that the first fix, from 14 Nov, is correct and should be used. So I set the bug report back to "Patch approved".

This fixes the problem that was detected initially. I changed the synopsis again to reflect better, what this fix is about. It does also implicitly fix the problem that one can remove another table's files if one created a like named table with its data/index directory in that table's database. One can now no longer create such table. The drop problem with externally modified symbolic links is not fixed with this patch. I split it out to the new bug report [Bug#40980](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=40980) (Drop table can remove another MyISAM table's data and index files).

Note that this will be fixed in 6.0 as it was rated too much of a "corner case" and too less of a security problem to be included into 5.1.

This is CVE CVE-2008-7247(Candidate).

Mitigation:

Normal database users are not expected to have the capability to create symlinks on the database server and in secure systems are expected to have no access to the database server filesystem and not even a login account on it.

If you believe you are vulnerable, you should fix the root cause, access to the filesystem of the database server.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- mysql
- local users could delete data files for tables of other users
(CVE-2010-1626).
- authenticated users could gather information for tables they
should not have access to (CVE-2010-1849)
- authenticated users could crash mysqld (CVE-2010-3683,
CVE-2010-3681, CVE-2010-1848)
- authenticated users could bypass intended access restrictions
(CVE-2008-7247, CVE-2009-4030)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1,
openSUSE 11.2
- dhcp
ISC DHCP can be crashed with a single dhcpv6 packet.
CVE-2010-3611 has been assigned to this issue.
Additionally a dhcrelay crash when receiving packets on interfaces
without assigned IPv4 address has been fixed as well as an infinite
loop in dhcpd.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- monotone
Remote attackers could crash a monotone server via an empty argument to
the 'mtn' command (CVE-2010-4098).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- moodle
This update of moodle fixes:
- CVE-2010-4207: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
charts/assets/charts.swf.
- CVE-2010-4208: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
uploader/assets/uploader.swf.
- CVE-2010-4209: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
swfstore/swfstore.swf.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1
- openssl/libopenssl-devel
Specially crafted responses from SSL servers could cause a double-free bug
in openssl's client implementation. Therefore a malicious SSL servers could
crash client-side code that uses the openssl library for its SSL connection.
(CVE-2010-2939: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM))
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

* [mysql-dfsg-5.1](/security/cves?package=mysql-dfsg-5.1) -

## Details

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table

files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use the DATA

DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly bypass privilege checks.

This update alters table creation behaviour by disallowing the use of the

MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 8.10. ([CVE-2008-4098](/security/CVE-2008-4098))

It was discovered that MySQL contained a cross-site scripting vulnerability

in the command-line client when the --html option is enabled. An attacker

could place arbitrary web script or html in a database cell, which would

then get placed in the html document output by the command-line tool. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04.

([CVE-2008-4456](/security/CVE-2008-4456))

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table

files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use symlinks

combined with the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly

bypass privilege checks. This issue only affected Ubuntu 9.10.

([CVE-2008-7247](/security/CVE-2008-7247))

It was discovered that MySQL contained multiple format string flaws when

logging database creation and deletion. An authenticated user could use

specially crafted database names to make MySQL crash, causing a denial of

service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04.

([CVE-2009-2446](/security/CVE-2009-2446))

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled errors when performing

certain SELECT statements, and did not preserve correct flags when

performing statements that use the GeomFromWKB function. An authenticated

user could exploit this to make MySQL crash, causing a denial of service.

([CVE-2009-4019](/security/CVE-2009-4019))

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly checked symlinks when using the

DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. A local user could use symlinks

to create tables that pointed to tables known to be created at a later

time, bypassing access restrictions. ([CVE-2009-4030](/security/CVE-2009-4030))

It was discovered that MySQL contained a buffer overflow when parsing

ssl certificates. A remote attacker could send crafted requests and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue did not

affect Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and the default compiler options for affected

releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. In the

default installation, attackers would also be isolated by the AppArmor

MySQL profile. ([CVE-2009-4484](/security/CVE-2009-4484))

- CVE-2010-0847: ImagingLib arbitrary code execution vulnerability
- CVE-2009-3555: TLS: MITM attacks via session renegotiation
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- irssi
irssi did not check the identity information of a remote hosts's certi-
ficate. Attackers could exploit that for a man-in-the-middle attack
(CVE-2010-1155).

server (CVE-2010-0624). It's advisable to always use tar's
--force-local local option to avoid such tricks.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- fuse
This update adds additional improvements to avoid a race condition in
fusermount that allowed users to umount any filesystem (related to
CVE-2009-3297). Thanks to Al Viro who found it.
Additionally a race condition in fusermount was fixed that allowed non-
privileged users to umount any file system (CVE-2010-0789).
Note: this is a re-release of the previous update with a better patch.
SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- apache2
Integer overflows in libapr could potentially be exploited to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-2412).
Specially crafted XML documents cause apache to consume large amounts
of memory (CVE-2009-1955).
Affected Products: SLES9
- libmysqlclient-devel
This update fixes several security issues in mysql:
- checking server certificates (CVE-2009-4028)
- error handling in subqueries (CVE-2009-4019)
- preserving null\_value flag in GeomFromWKB (CVE-2009-4019)
- symlink behavior fixed (CVE-2008-7247)
- symlink behavior refixed (CVE-2009-4030)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cpio
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow flaw that can happen
while expanding specially-crafted archive files (CVE-2010-0624).
It also contains changes for:
- fixed Dat160 Tape Drive density information (bnc#415166)
- fixed cpio issues with file sizes >= 2^32
- fixed handling eof and eod marks (bnc#371077)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11
- moodle
Moodle version 1.9.8 fixes several security issues including
cross-site-scripting (XSS) and SQL injection bugs (CVE-2010-1613,
CVE-2010-1614, CVE-2010-1615, CVE-2010-1616, CVE-2010-1617
CVE-2010-1618, CVE-2010-1619).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- libmikmod
Specially crafted "Impulse Tracker" and "Ultratracker" files could cause a
heap based buffer overflow in libmikmod. Attackers could exploit that to
crash or potentially execute code in applications linking against libmikmod
(CVE-2009-3995, CVE-2009-3996).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libicecore

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
