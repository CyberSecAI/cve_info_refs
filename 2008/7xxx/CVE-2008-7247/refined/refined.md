  "CVE-2008-7247": {
    "match": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly resolve symbolic links when a user specifies a DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY during table creation. Specifically, when the data directory contains a symbolic link to another file system, and the `DATA DIRECTORY` or `INDEX DIRECTORY` clause refers to a subdirectory, the check for whether the specified path falls within the data directory fails. This occurs because realpath(3) returns ENOENT if the resolved path does not refer to an existing file. The comparison can then fail even if the requested path is within the data directory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper symlink resolution",
        "Insufficient path validation",
        "Incorrect access restriction enforcement"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote authenticated users can bypass intended access restrictions, leading to unauthorized table creation and potential data manipulation/destruction. A user with `CREATE` and `DROP` privileges can delete tables in other databases by creating a table with a symbolic link that redirects to the target database.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote authenticated users can exploit this by using `CREATE TABLE` statements with `DATA DIRECTORY` or `INDEX DIRECTORY` arguments that utilize a symbolic link."
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create tables, and write access to the filesystem somewhere on the database server."
    },
     "affected_versions": [
      "MySQL 5.0.x through 5.0.88",
      "MySQL 5.1.x through 5.1.41",
      "MySQL 6.0 before 6.0.9-alpha"
     ]
