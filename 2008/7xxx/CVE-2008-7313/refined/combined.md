The fix applied in Snoopy rev 1.28 was insufficient / incomplete and it
did allow command execution.  There should be 2 CVEs, afaics.

It seems there actually is a longer list of incomplete fixes for this
issue.

2002
<http://sourceforge.net/p/snoopy/bugs/13/>

It seems this allowed the most simple injections:
  <https://example.com>;id
  <https://example.com/foo.html;id>

Fixed in 2004 via:
<http://snoopy.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/snoopy/Snoopy/Snoopy.class.php?view=log#rev1.11>

This strips double quotes and adds quotes around URI argument.

2005
<http://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&m=113027008504631&w=3>
SEC-Consult SA 20051025-0
CVE-2005-3330

This was via curl -H argument value, required use of double quote to
escape double quotes quoting of header argument, and required command in
the host part of the url:
  <https://example.com>";id

Fixed in a similar way the previous one was addressed:
<http://snoopy.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/snoopy/Snoopy/Snoopy.class.php?view=log#rev1.20>

2008
(I guess this is the initial report)
<http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2008-09/0078.html>
CVE-2008-4796

The version of the _httpsrequest quoted there does not use $safer_URI
and hence seems to pre-date the fix from 2004, so it might be the same
issue as the 2002/2004 one.  However, the use of backtick in the
example exploit should have made it work on Snoopy versions with the
above two fixes.
  <https://example.com>`id`
  <https://example.com/foo.html>`id`

Fixed using escapeshellcmd():
<http://snoopy.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/snoopy/Snoopy/Snoopy.class.php?view=log#rev1.25>

Followed by a similar fix for headers few days later, which probably
was not picked up by folks backporting the above commit as the fix for
this CVE:
<http://snoopy.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/snoopy/Snoopy/Snoopy.class.php?view=log#rev1.27>

2014
<http://mstrokin.com/sec/feed2js-magpierss-0day-vulnerability-not-really-it-is-actually-cve-2005-3330-cve-2008-4796/>

The above blog post shows how to inject additional command line
arguments for curl and what can be achieved with that.

Fixed using escapeshellarg():
<http://snoopy.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/snoopy/Snoopy/Snoopy.class.php?view=log#rev1.28>

So this should be new 2014 CVE-1.

The above commit reverts rev 1.27 change (I don't dare to guess if that
was intentional or not), and hence for the header / -H case, it changed
curl command line argument injection into direct arbitrary code
injection using backticks as noted for the 2008 issue above.

If you need public reference, there's:
<https://github.com/cogdog/feed2js/pull/12#issuecomment-48283706>

or UPD3 update near the end of the mstrokin's blog post.

I believe this is should get different 2014 CVE-2, because there was
upstream version that was believed to have all issues fixed.

Rather than fixing escaping of header arguments, Snoopy upstream
removed curl code and made Snoopy open SSL connection to https server
directly.  That was done in rev 1.29, that was further corrected in
subsequent commits.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0212)

## Topic

An update for nagios is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Nagios is a program that monitors hosts and services on your network, and has the ability to send email or page alerts when a problem arises or is resolved. Nagios is written in C and designed to run under Linux (and some other \*NIX variants) as a background process, intermittently running checks on various services that you specify. The actual service checks are performed by separate "plugin" programs which return the status of the checks to Nagios. Nagios plugins are available at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nagiosplug.> This package provides the core program, web interface, and documentation files for Nagios. Development files are built as a separate package.

Security Fix(es):

* Various command-execution flaws were found in the Snoopy library included with Nagios. These flaws allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands by manipulating Nagios HTTP headers. (CVE-2008-7313, CVE-2014-5008, CVE-2014-5009)
* It was found that an attacker who could control the content of an RSS feed could execute code remotely using the Nagios web interface. This flaw could be used to gain access to the remote system and in some scenarios control over the system. (CVE-2016-9565)
* A privileges flaw was found in Nagios where log files were unsafely handled. An attacker who could control Nagios logging configuration ('nagios' user/group) could exploit the flaw to elevate their access to that of a privileged user. (CVE-2016-9566)

Red Hat would like to thank Dawid Golunski for reporting CVE-2016-9565 and CVE-2016-9566.

Subject: CVE request - Snoopy incomplete fix for CVE-2008-4796

Please see: <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jul/16>

Note, the new fix [1] referenced in the above FD posts does not look to
be a complete fix either and may still allow command injection.

Snoopy upstream has been notified and a more complete fix that removes
curl and instead uses native php code should be available shortly [2].

Thanks.

## Synopsis

Important: nagios security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0211)

## Topic

An update for nagios is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Nagios is a program that monitors hosts and services on your network, and has the ability to send email or page alerts when a problem arises or is resolved. Nagios is written in C and designed to run under Linux (and some other \*NIX variants) as a background process, intermittently running checks on various services that you specify. The actual service checks are performed by separate "plugin" programs which return the status of the checks to Nagios. Nagios plugins are available at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nagiosplug.> This package provides the core program, web interface, and documentation files for Nagios. Development files are built as a separate package.

Security Fix(es):

* Various command-execution flaws were found in the Snoopy library included with Nagios. These flaws allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands by manipulating Nagios HTTP headers. (CVE-2008-7313, CVE-2014-5008, CVE-2014-5009)
* It was found that an attacker who could control the content of an RSS feed could execute code remotely using the Nagios web interface. This flaw could be used to gain access to the remote system and in some scenarios control over the system. (CVE-2016-9565)
* A privileges flaw was found in Nagios where log files were unsafely handled. An attacker who could control Nagios logging configuration ('nagios' user/group) could exploit the flaw to elevate their access to that of a privileged user. (CVE-2016-9566)

Red Hat would like to thank Dawid Golunski for reporting CVE-2016-9565 and CVE-2016-9566.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1405363#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-16 10:14:14 UTC  ``` MagpieRSS, a component for handling RSS news feeds in Nagios Core control panel / front-end, was found vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient neutralization of special elements in function _httpsrequest().  The vulnerability could potentially enable remote unauthenticated attackers who  managed to impersonate the feed server (via DNS poisoning, domain hijacking, ARP spoofing etc.), to provide a malicious response that injects parameters to curl command used by the affected RSS client class and effectively read/write arbitrary files on the vulnerable Nagios server. This could lead to Remote Code Execution in the context of www-data/nagios user on default Nagios installs that follow the official setup guidelines.  This issue is due to incomplete fix of [CVE-2008-4796](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-4796).  External References:  <https://legalhackers.com/advisories/Nagios-Exploit-Command-Injection-CVE-2016-9565-2008-4796.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1405363#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-16 10:15:44 UTC  ```  Created nagios tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1405364](show_bug.cgi?id=1405364 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-9565 nagios: Command injection via curl in MagpieRSS [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1405365](show_bug.cgi?id=1405365 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-9565 nagios: Command injection via curl in MagpieRSS [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1405363#c2)  Jason Shepherd    2016-12-21 00:26:25 UTC  ``` I looked at this in relation to Nagios 4.0.8 and found that Snoopy's fetch funtion is used by rss_fetch in Nagios. The 'rss_fetch' method in 'rss_fetch.inc' is called by various php files in Nagios, but doesn't except user input to the request. Setting RHMAP as wontfix as a consequence.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1405363#c4)  Andrej Nemec    2016-12-21 09:02:16 UTC  ``` References:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/714>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1405363#c6)  Siddharth Sharma    2016-12-21 14:55:50 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  #!/bin/bash  mv /usr/share/nagios/html/includes/rss /usr/share/nagios/html/includes/rss.disarmed mv /usr/share/nagios/html/rss-corefeed.php /usr/share/nagios/html/rss-corefeed.php.disarmed mv /usr/share/nagios/html/rss-newsfeed.php /usr/share/nagios/html/rss-newsfeed.php.disarmed  This should disable rss from nagios installation and stop affected php code from being executed. Only downside to this would be news widget wont fetch any data from nagios.org rss feeds.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1405363#c7)  Siddharth Sharma    2016-12-21 15:59:40 UTC  ``` Nagios is shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1, Red Hat Openstack 5,6,7, and  Red Hat Mobile Application Platform 4.

The issue was fixed in Snoopy upstream by changing it to use native PHP functions to fetch web pages instead of using curl:  <http://snoopy.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/snoopy/Snoopy/Snoopy.class.php?view=log#rev1.29>  Nagios upstream fixed the problem in version 4.2.2 by removing MagpieRSS and hence Snoopy:  <https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/commit/f0808f9c2aca777685ba57e71a8cd7b4baa8aa78>  Note that this CVE is actually a dupe of [CVE-2014-5008](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-5008) ([bug 1121497](show_bug.cgi?id=1121497 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-7313 CVE-2014-5008 CVE-2014-5009 snoopy: incomplete fixes for command execution flaws")).   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1405363#c11)  Stephen John Smoogen    2017-01-16 17:26:09 UTC  ``` Current status: This package does not have an active maintainer.

# Nagios: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201702-26**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Nagios, the worst of
which could lead to privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/nagios-core** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.4** |

### Background

Nagios is an open source host, service and network monitoring program.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Nagios. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A local attacker, who either is already Nagios’s system user or

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0213)

## Topic

An update for nagios is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Nagios is a program that monitors hosts and services on your network, and has the ability to send email or page alerts when a problem arises or is resolved. Nagios is written in C and designed to run under Linux (and some other \*NIX variants) as a background process, intermittently running checks on various services that you specify. The actual service checks are performed by separate "plugin" programs which return the status of the checks to Nagios. Nagios plugins are available at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nagiosplug.> This package provides the core program, web interface, and documentation files for Nagios. Development files are built as a separate package.

Security Fix(es):

* Various command-execution flaws were found in the Snoopy library included with Nagios. These flaws allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands by manipulating Nagios HTTP headers. (CVE-2008-7313, CVE-2014-5008, CVE-2014-5009)
* It was found that an attacker who could control the content of an RSS feed could execute code remotely using the Nagios web interface. This flaw could be used to gain access to the remote system and in some scenarios control over the system. (CVE-2016-9565)
* A privileges flaw was found in Nagios where log files were unsafely handled. An attacker who could control Nagios logging configuration ('nagios' user/group) could exploit the flaw to elevate their access to that of a privileged user. (CVE-2016-9566)

Red Hat would like to thank Dawid Golunski for reporting CVE-2016-9565 and CVE-2016-9566.

## Synopsis

Important: nagios security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0214)

## Topic

An update for nagios is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Nagios is a program that monitors hosts and services on your network, and has the ability to send email or page alerts when a problem arises or is resolved. Nagios is written in C and designed to run under Linux (and some other \*NIX variants) as a background process, intermittently running checks on various services that you specify. The actual service checks are performed by separate "plugin" programs which return the status of the checks to Nagios. Nagios plugins are available at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nagiosplug.> This package provides the core program, web interface, and documentation files for Nagios. Development files are built as a separate package.

Security Fix(es):

* Various command-execution flaws were found in the Snoopy library included with Nagios. These flaws allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands by manipulating Nagios HTTP headers. (CVE-2008-7313, CVE-2014-5008, CVE-2014-5009)
* It was found that an attacker who could control the content of an RSS feed could execute code remotely using the Nagios web interface. This flaw could be used to gain access to the remote system and in some scenarios control over the system. (CVE-2016-9565)
* A privileges flaw was found in Nagios where log files were unsafely handled. An attacker who could control Nagios logging configuration ('nagios' user/group) could exploit the flaw to elevate their access to that of a privileged user. (CVE-2016-9566)

Red Hat would like to thank Dawid Golunski for reporting CVE-2016-9565 and CVE-2016-9566.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1121497#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-07-21 06:11:00 UTC  ``` [CVE-2008-4796](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-4796) describes a command execution flaw in the Snoopy library. A similar fix exists for headers:  <http://snoopy.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/snoopy/Snoopy/Snoopy.class.php?view=log#rev1.27>  The header fix has been assigned [CVE-2008-7313](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-7313) (as an incomplete fix for [CVE-2008-4796](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-4796)).

There is example code in the nagios src package that is vulnerable but it is not included in the built packages.  There is only 2 places that the vulnerable code is reached in nagios:  1. rss-corefeed.php:  18 function do_corefeed_html() { 19  20         $url="<http://www.nagios.org/backend/feeds/corepromo>"; 21         $rss=fetch_rss($url);   2. rss-newsfeed.php:  16 function do_newsfeed_html() { 17  18         $url="<http://www.nagios.org/backend/feeds/frontpage/>"; 19         $rss=fetch_rss($url);  Neither of these accept anything but static input.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1121497#c7)  Summer Long    2017-01-30 23:56:53 UTC  ``` This is now being fixed; reopening.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1121497#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-31 05:53:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:0214 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0214.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1121497#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-31 05:54:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:0213 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0213.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1121497#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-31 05:56:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2017:0212 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0212.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1121497#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-31 05:57:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:0211 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0211.html>   ``` |  |
