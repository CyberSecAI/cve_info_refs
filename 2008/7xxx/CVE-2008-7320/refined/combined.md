### Bug Description

Binary package hint: seahorse

When I log in the first time, I get asked for my password to access the wireless network.

Then any time later I can run seahorse (without authentication) and go and look at my wireless password (password tab / passphrase for wireless network / properties). It just asks me 'Do you want to allow access?' and if I say yes (ie 'Allow Once' or 'Allow Always'), it doesn't ask for authentication or anything, it just shows the password.

Isn't this a security problem?

If I reboot just X with CTRL-ALT-BS and log in again, when I run seahorse it asks me for authentication to run it, but after a full reboot it doesn't ask for any authentication.

I have automatic login enabled (so on full reboot I don't need to login via the X login window) if that makes any difference.

Version info:

distro: hardy alpha 4

kernel: 2.6.24-5-generic

seahorse: 2.21.4-0ubuntu2

gnu-pg: 1.4.6-2ubuntu5

python-gnupginterface: 0.3.2-9ubuntu1

To clarify: I mean that when I log in the first time, I get asked for the password to my gnome-keyring so that nm-applet can retrieve the wireless network password, and so by the time I open seahorse I've already authenticated with gnome-keyring.

Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. It appears as this isn't a bug though... If you are prompted to enter a password (or allowed to choose to always allow access to the keyring) then you will be able to access the wireless password without anymore prompts.

Perhaps the dialog granting a program the right to read a password should require you to confirm with the master password, even if the keychain is unlocked. As of now, all you have to do is click a button - seems like the barrier is too low.

I see this as a VERY serious security flaw!

Given that Empathy Instant Messenger is going to be the default messenger in the next Ubuntu Release, I thought I'd check it out. While setting up my gmail and msn accounts I noticed that it was saving the passwords in the public keyring. It was also giving the familiar quickAllow ("Deny","Allow Once", "AllowAll") dialog when starting up the program and connecting to these accounts. No prompting for any password to protect the keyring.

Given that this was being stored in a public keyring, I wanted to see how easy it was to find these password. I open up sea horse, and hey presto! My passwords to gmail and msn are available for all to see for someone who might be strolling around my workstation/laptop while i'm not there, (if I forget to log out or lock)... using the quickAllow dialog.

Now if someone finds my wireless network key, I don't really care in the scheme of things, even if they use my network to commit bad acts, it happens often enough that I'm unlikely to be penalized. However! I and most people have very sensitive information in our webmail accounts and easy access to them is definitely something I'd like to avoid.

It looks like the quickAllow dialog is from some common library that both applications call into. Please can this prompt for a password, the same way as critical updates do!!!

Thank you.

This is my idea to solve the problem quoted from the forums;

he way I see it Ubuntu is almost there, seahorse does ask permission just no confirmation. And we do have the tools like gconf. And policykit, witch can handle non-root permissions and IMO is way under used.

Here's my idea, create a sane list of default apps that can access seahorse. The ability to change that list through gconf, and permission checks through policykit for unexpected apps, changing info or viewing passwords. And finally come up with a unified personal security policy for the desktop as a whole. (See above post 182; you need your password to change your password and about me does not display clear text.)

@Corey: that sounds great to me. Perhaps you should add your comments to the gnome-bug (<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=551036>)? It's a Gnome issue and I think the Ubuntu devs are waiting for it to be solved upstream.

Empathy stores your authentication information into your private keyring that is only accessible by you with the password you use to unlock it. There is no "public keyring". Pidgin stores your account passwords in clear text in a file with appropriate user permissions.

My view is that this as a very serious design flaw. The bottom line is that passwords should never be displayed in plain text by any application, for any reason.

I'm in agreement with comments #6 and #12. This is a VERY serious security issue. The quick allow dialog protects the passwords stored in the wallet from network intruders or malware, but if someone happens to have access to your computer when you forget to lock the screen, they can easily see all of your passwords in plain text.

I'm personally not opposed to the ability to see these passwords once you've gained access, but for security it is critical that this access be protected by a password prompt even if the keyring has been unlocked. There is a big difference between allowing a program to access a stored password with the quick allow dialog, and giving a user access to the full list of passwords in plain text. Having a quick allow dialog in this context is a major oversight, and IMHO it should be considered a serious bug.

from a theoretical, scientific, cryptographical point of view it might be (and probably is) no problem to display the passwords without restriction once the keyring has been unlocked as anyone really interested can retrieve them anyways. not having to retype the password[1] dramatically lowers the amount of both knowledge and malice needed, however.

contra: having to retype the password might create the false illusion of a security and users might believe passwords are secure when they are not.

pro: on the other hand, it might stop your buddy from looking at all your passwords when you show him the wlan password he needs when your kids playing in the same room accidentally throw a basketball against your chair, a leg breaks, you fall down, spill your cup of coffee. now you go to the kitchen to clean up the mess, to the bathroom to clean up some more mess and change clothes. and then you remember: "damn! i forgot to lock the keyring..."

this user story is purely fictional. i don't even have kids :) but i think having to enter your password before displaying passwords in plain text (or not allowing that at all!!!!) would stop most opportunistic/accidental password leakage.

[1] the keyring manager in firefox uses this approach and i think is a sound approach...

I've noticed this problem also with Ubuntu 10.04

I don't know the motivations about the choose, but I think it is dangerous because a lot of password are used for many services. Think people that have got hotmail account, with the same password you could open your msn account and your email account...

I hope that this will change in a few time.

I don't agree with Comment #20:

\* The problem exists sice 2 years

\* The importance is more than medium: eg. in case of a vpn password, a single signon corporate password is showed!

\* So it is a HIGH RISK SECURITY ISSUE and the UBUNTU TEAM should ATTENT TO THAT PROBLEM (patch itself or replace the Seahorse UI)!!!

Indeed. I want also to stress that this is a very serious security issue (e.g. when working in environments with multiple working people, in the train, etc). Before ending here, I just figured out that I could display my login passwd in seahorse without any security barrier as well. It basically takes 10 secs for anybody to read one's login passwd in clear text.

Please do something !!!

I concur with Igor's last comment. I've recently started using an extension for Mozilla Firefox which integrates Firefox's password cache with the GNOME keyring and I was shocked to find that one could open seahorse and browse all of the passwords therein (within any unlocked keyring; I use the default login keyring) as plain text. It's one thing to unlock a key ring and allow a programme to access these passwords for the entire session (though it would be nice to see options to re-lock a keyring after x minutes and/or every time the screen locks), it's quite another to allow any interloper to access those passwords as plain text.

I hope that this gets fixed soon. This seems like a fairly old/established bug, and one would have hoped a security issue like this would have been fixed by now. I don't mean to be patronising, condescending or a back-seat driver mind. I was just startled that such an obvious security hole existed.

I hope that this gets fixed soon. This seems like a fairly old/established bug, and one would have hoped a security issue like this would have been fixed by now. I don't mean to be patronising, condescending or a back-seat driver mind. I was just startled that such an obvious security hole existed.

GNOME is probably not going to fix this - it's not just the GNOME Way. I'd like to see Ubuntu address this, though. Today, if I walk up to any Ubuntu user's unlocked computer I can see any of their passwords in just a few keystrokes: Super + P + A + S + Enter starts Seahorse, then I can double click any password I want and click Show Password. From the comments above, I can see I'm not alone in being wary of this.

Ubuntu, would you take a patch to require the user to enter their login password to use the Show Password feature?

I just placed a bounty on this bug at Bountysource:

<https://www.bountysource.com/issues/3849352-seahorse-shows-passwords-without-verification>

It will be paid to anyone who provides a patch that Ubuntu accepts.

Is this underway, or what? First reported \*eight years ago\*, last update one year ago, and right now I can still open seahorse and see plaintext of all my passwords.

How hard can it be to do exactly what Chrome or many other implementations do, and just ask for a master password before allowing the user to view the plaintext of saved passwords?

Sorry, the "how hard can it be" phrasing is bit snarky. Just a bit disappointed that after eight years no time has been made for this.

Apparently it is a "design decision" and therefore not a bug.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c0)  Andreas Moog    2008-09-05 19:31:42 UTC  ``` Please describe the problem: When I log in the first time, I get asked for my password to access the wireless network.  Then any time later I can run seahorse (without authentication) and go and look at my wireless password (password tab / passphrase for wireless network / properties). It just asks me 'Do you want to allow access?' and if I say yes (ie 'Allow Once' or 'Allow Always'), it doesn't ask for authentication or anything, it just shows the password.  Isn't this a security problem?  If I reboot just X with CTRL-ALT-BS and log in again, when I run seahorse it asks me for authentication to run it, but after a full reboot it doesn't ask for any authentication.  I have automatic login enabled (so on full reboot I don't need to login via the X login window) if that makes any difference.  Steps to reproduce:   Actual results:   Expected results:   Does this happen every time? Yes  Other information: This bug was reported on Launchpad: [https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/seahorse/+bug/189774](https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/seahorse/%2Bbug/189774) ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c1)  Pierre Mazoyer    2008-11-24 19:26:08 UTC  ``` I can confirm this too. The "Show in clear text" check box is very very unsecure.  Anyone having access to your computer can sit, run seahorse and READ YOUR PASSWORDS IN CLEAR TEXT stored in the 'login' keyring after having clicked 'Allow Once' or 'Allow Always' in the unsafe 'Do you want to allow access?' dialog.  I checked how this issue is handled in Mac OS X's keyring application and it solves the problem by always asking keyring's unlock password if you request to read a password in clear text.  To summarize:  Every time a user wants to read a password in clear text, seahorse SHOULD ALWAYS request keyring's unlock password before displaying it. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c2)  Stef Walter    2008-12-11 20:37:23 UTC  ``` I agree this is a problem. It's a difficult one to solve. There are also extreme wishes on teh other side: <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=533493> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c3)  Colin Walters    2008-12-11 20:50:11 UTC  ``` Remember, anyone having access to your computer (X session) can also install a keylogger trojan.  We already have a password entry field protecting private data for a running session - it's called gnome-screensaver. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c4)  Pierre Mazoyer    2008-12-12 07:25:57 UTC  ``` I agree anyone having access to the computer can do nasty things, but on the other hand, practically, leaving access to a computer in a family to friends or other people without a specific login is also quite common for normal house users who are not "paranoid" (please see no offense in this expression).  One way to solve this issue is to remove the "Show password in clear text" feature from seahorse. This especially make sense if seahorse goal is to store application passwords.  But I admit that in rare cases, it is useful to read the password in clear text "because we have forgotten it as we do not type it very often". In this case, I suggest that seahorse always request keyring's unlock password for the operation. (The "Allow once/always/Deny" dialog is not useful here). ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c5)  Andrej Zirko    2008-12-12 17:31:22 UTC  ``` I agree that Show password in clear text is very insecure. One thing is when somebody gets access to my computer and read my email once, other thing is when he writes down a password(with ease thanks to seahorse) and browse my email from anywhere. Fixing this issue is so simple - just ask for password before displaying the password. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c6)  Adam Schreiber    2008-12-12 19:51:51 UTC  ``` It's not very, very simple, and I believe that stems from some confusion  as to what's happening.  gnome-keyring stores the secrets and access control lists about applications and what they can do with each secret (read, write, delete).  The dialog presented when the password expander is toggled comes from gnome-keyring and is giving seahorse one time or all time access to the secret but doesn't ask seahorse what it's doing with the secret (using it, displaying it).  This is the exact same dialog any application/user querying the keyring would recieve when your keyring is unlocked.  If your distribution or self install uses the PAM module, your keyring is unlocked when you login, locked when your screen is locked, unlocked when you unlock your screen and locked when you log out.  This is usability at the cost of security (i.e. you don't have to enter the unlock password after logging in).  You can easily disable this feature by changing the password of your keyring to something other than your login password or disabling the PAM module.  You will now be asked to unlock your keyring every time an application wants to use a secret (including right after login when NM wants to connect to your secured wireless network).  There is no "right" security model for everyone and perhaps the real solution is to have the screen lock by default when the screensaver engages so that the default security model is more consistent.  Like Pierre said anyone with X access to your computer can do plenty of nasty things, including query gnome-keyring from the command line or run an application to get the same info as seahorse. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c7)  xtera    2009-03-19 02:18:46 UTC  ``` I see now how complicated this problem is to solve. Apparently the problem lies on different security approach that gnome-keyring use than others.  Is it possible to make Seahorse ALWAYS trigger prompt for password when the user want reveal the password in clear text? I think it does.  The primary goal of this issue is to prevent the password from being stolen by ordinary non-skilled users. So any password-access solution should do. It doesn't have to be encrypted or so. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c8)  xtera    2009-03-19 02:32:01 UTC  ``` If I see Firefox's security model. I think it looks similar with gnome-keyring.  In Firefox, when master password are set, revealing password in clear text requires master password.  I think that is quite good solution if can be applied nicely. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c9)  Pierre Mazoyer    2009-03-19 10:28:59 UTC  ``` Ok if I understand well what Adam says, when keyring is unlocked, any program having the read access right for a secret can read it from gnome-keyring. If the program does not have read right, the "Allow/Deny" dialog pops up and the user can grant it this right (temporarily or permanently) **without entering keyring's password**.  Maybe a solution would be to always request keyring's password to "Allow (once or always)" a program that has no right so far to read a secret, **even if keyring is unlocked**. If "Allow Once" is chosen and keyring's password is correct, read right is granted for this time but program is not added in access control list for this secret. If "Allow Always" is chosen and keyring's password is correct, program is granted read right in access control list for this secret and future read attempts would be always be granted if keyring is unlocked. It would be user responsibility to not "Allow always" a program that should not be allowed to access a secret permanently if keyring is unlocked.  If gnome-keyring worked this way, clicking "Show in clear text" in Seahorse would pop up the Allow Once/Always/Deny dialog with an additional password field requesting keyring's password to perform any "Allow" action (once again **even if keyring would be unlocked**). It would be user responsibility to allow only once access to seahorse to avoid future unwanted reads.  To summarize in another way, unlocking keyring would grant any program with permanent rights to do what they are allowed to but **not to add new rights (temporarily or permanently) to a program without requesting keyring password again**.  Does it make sense? ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c10)  Stef Walter    2009-03-20 21:25:23 UTC  ``` Linking some interesting reads, before continuing this discussion. Especially the point about, put another way, on most Linux desktops, the entire login session is one security context.   <http://live.gnome.org/GnomeKeyring/SecurityPhilosophy>  <http://live.gnome.org/GnomeKeyring/StoringSecrets>   ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c11)  Adam Schreiber    2009-05-21 18:25:10 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 583484](show_bug.cgi?id=583484 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - seahorse allows application access to keyring without password") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c12)  Daniel    2009-08-28 14:33:22 UTC  ``` I wrote this on the ubuntu branch of this bug to escalate the seriousness of this flaw: ============================================================== I see this as a VERY serious security flaw!  Given that Empathy Instant Messenger is going to be the default messenger in the next Ubuntu Release, I thought I'd check it out. While setting up my gmail and msn accounts I noticed that it was saving the passwords in the public keyring. It was also giving the familiar quickAllow ("Deny","Allow Once", "AllowAll") dialog when starting up the program and connecting to these accounts. No prompting for any password to protect the keyring.  Given that this was being stored in a public keyring, I wanted to see how easy it was to find these password. I open up sea horse, and hey presto! My passwords to gmail and msn are available for all to see for someone who might be strolling around my workstation/laptop while i'm not there, (if I forget to log out or lock)... using the quickAllow dialog.  Now if someone finds my wireless network key, I don't really care in the scheme of things, even if they use my network to commit bad acts, it happens often enough that I'm unlikely to be penalized. However! I and most people have very sensitive information in our webmail accounts and easy access to them is definitely something I'd like to avoid.  It looks like the quickAllow dialog is from some common library that both applications call into. Please can this prompt for a password, the same way as critical updates do!!!  Thank you. ==============================================================  Okay.  I've now read through the complications of this process on the gnome bugzilla page, including the links GnomeKeyring Security Philosophies.  Quite simply, you cannot solve this problem in a way that solves both -usability- concerns and -security- concerns if you don't have Security Contexts for different apps AND Acls for different apps to remember which ones can access what (require passwords, always have a access to passwords).  It seems to me that the section about Active attacks expresses the attitude that up till now endeavouring to provide these functionalities has not been worthwhile. Hopefully this opinion will change now that it will become far more common for sensitive information to be stored in the GnomeKeyring.  Re:Firefox I was dismayed to find that firefox allows all passwords to be displayed through the UI by default. Of course I knew since there was no prompting for a master password initially that it was possible to get to the data, I didn't think that it would be so easy through the UI. I regard this as the App giving a false sense of security. After managing to steal some co-workers passwords and showing them, I've now set a master password for the few passwords I save in the app. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c13)  Mark Edgington    2009-11-04 09:43:58 UTC  ``` A possibly interesting solution is outlined in the following comment: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/seahorse/+bug/189774/comments/9](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/seahorse/%2Bbug/189774/comments/9)  It involves using policykit to enable keyring access for only predesignated apps. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c14)  Stef Walter    2009-11-04 14:33:13 UTC  ``` That solution involves running gnome-keyring as root, as a system service rather than in the user session. An interesting solution none the less, and we can look into the benefits and drawbacks. But it's important to realize this is a complete architecture change, and would require lots of redesign and recoding. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c15)  Dave Lillis    2009-11-27 02:36:10 UTC  ``` Can somebody please explain why there is a GUI option to display passwords in plain text in the first place, regardless of what how you may gain access to it? ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c16)  Elias K Gardner    2009-12-02 03:44:41 UTC  ``` Wouldn't this be much simpler if it were a bug in seahorse instead of gnome-keyring?  Seahorse should simply be expected to prompt for a password before displaying a key's plain text password. Gnome-keyring's behavior does not need to be changed it will still display the deny, allow once or always prompt as it should. Getting two prompts is a little annoying but is a better solution than having passwords in plain sight.  I would like to welcome anybody in my house to use my computer which seems stupid if its that easy to access all of my passwords.  ishnid@gmail.com: it is very helpful to be able to see passwords in plain text occasionally. For example if a friend wants to get on my wifi network it is much better and easier to have the password on my computer than to need to find it written in my house somewhere. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c17)  arielgnu    2011-05-06 19:39:17 UTC  ``` I know there must be hundreds of ways to get your privacy compromise if some one uses your computer while you are gone, but you don't have to be a computer genius to open seahorse in less than 30 secs. In my opinion, there is different computer levels, I feel I'm just in the desktop level, and the fact that using the mouse is all you have to know to open seahorse and watch somebody else password doesn't feel right to me. ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c18)  Aaron    2011-05-17 20:15:22 UTC  ``` We are not allowed to give our users the WIFI Code. We set it up for them and they should not be able to access it but the keyring allows them to see the code in plain text. and without access to the keyring they cant access the WIFI. Its Simply a deal breaker for using linux in our environment. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c19)  Colin Walters    2011-05-17 21:49:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c18)) > We are not allowed to give our users the WIFI Code.

Its Simply a deal breaker for using linux in our environment.  I think you might be able to restrict this with NetworkManager 0.9 since the connections are system wide, not per user. ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c20)  AndrÃ© Klapper    2011-11-26 20:48:27 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 617332](show_bug.cgi?id=617332 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Gnome keyring passwords exposed") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=551036#c21)  AndrÃ© Klapper    2021-06-18 10:40:48 UTC  ``` GNOME is going to shut down bugzilla.gnome.org in favor of gitlab.gnome.org. As part of that, we are mass-closing older open tickets in bugzilla.gnome.org which have not seen updates for a longer time (resources are unfortunately quite limited so not every ticket can get handled).  If you can still reproduce the situation described in this ticket in a recent and supported software version, then please follow   <https://wiki.gnome.org/GettingInTouch/BugReportingGuidelines> and create a new ticket at   <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-keyring/-/issues/>  Thank you for your understanding and your help. ``` |  |
