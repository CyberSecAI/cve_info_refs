  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the zKup CMS application's user registration functionality. Specifically, the script used to add administrators to the system, located at `./admin/configuration/modifier.php`, insufficiently validates the 'login' parameter. The script uses a regular expression `#^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$#` to check if the input is alphanumeric, however this check can be bypassed using a null byte (%00).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Regular expression bypass vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code into the `fichiers/config.php` file. This file is used to store admin credentials. By injecting malicious PHP code, the attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server. The exploit included a basic file upload form.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to `./admin/configuration/modifier.php`",
       "Manipulated 'login' parameter including a null byte and PHP code"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the server",
      "Knowledge of the vulnerable URL and parameter"
