Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2008-7157:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of two issues: an authentication bypass and an arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The application uses `register_globals` which allows an attacker to manipulate the `$_groups` variable via a GET request, circumventing the admin check within the admin panel scripts.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The upload function does not properly validate the file extension, allowing an attacker to upload files with a `.php` extension (disguised as a `.gif`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The use of `register_globals` allows for manipulation of variables, bypassing authorization checks.
*   **Insecure File Upload:**  The lack of proper file extension validation enables the upload of executable files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the privileges of the web server process, a successful exploit could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `_groups` parameter in the URL to bypass authentication.
*   **File Upload Form:** The attacker uses the avatar upload form to upload a malicious PHP file disguised as an image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:**  The attacker needs the ability to craft GET requests and upload files through the web interface.
*   **No prior authentication:** The authentication bypass allows an unauthenticated attacker to access admin pages.
