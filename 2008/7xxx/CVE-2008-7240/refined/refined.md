Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to the insecure inclusion of a file in `include/unverified.inc.php`. The `$template` variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to control the path of the included file.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary local files via the `template` parameter in the `unverified.inc.php` script.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize the `template` parameter, making it vulnerable to path manipulation.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   Read arbitrary files from the server, potentially exposing sensitive data like configuration files, database credentials, and source code.
    *   Execute arbitrary PHP code by including files with malicious code.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP request targeting the `include/unverified.inc.php` script.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability as it occurs in the unverified script.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is in `include/unverified.inc.php`:
```php
<?php
  include("./templates/$template/global.inc.php");
?>
```
The exploit is triggered by sending a request such as:
`Vuln.Com/include/unverified.inc.php?template=CODE`
where 'CODE' is replaced with a path to a file.

This exploit leverages the fact that the `template` parameter is directly used in the `include` function without any sanitization, enabling LFI.
