Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   The provided blog post from "theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com" directly discusses a vulnerability in Intel's Q35 chipset, which was exploited to subvert Xen hypervisor on VT-d enabled systems. The blog post also references an Intel advisory, linking it to the Q35 chipset vulnerability. This confirms the content is related to a specific vulnerability in the Intel Q35 chipset, which is the subject of CVE-2008-7096.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is a bug in the Intel Q35 chipset. This bug allows unauthorized modification of System Management Mode (SMM) code or hypervisor memory. The specifics of how the chipset allowed this were not included in the blog posts. 

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - The primary vulnerability is the ability to modify SMM code or the hypervisor memory.
   - Specifically, the weakness exists in how the Q35 chipset handles memory access or configuration, allowing software (potentially with elevated privileges) to bypass intended protection mechanisms.
   - The vulnerability can bypass hypervisor VT-d (Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O) protections.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   -   **Hypervisor Subversion:** An attacker can modify the hypervisor memory and potentially install a hypervisor rootkit. This grants the attacker complete control over the virtualized environment, including the host OS and all guest VMs.
   - **System Instability:** Modification of SMM code could also lead to system instability or unexpected behavior.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **PCI Configuration Space Access:**  An attacker can gain access to the PCI configuration space of device 0:0:0, which is possible via `iopl()` on Linux systems and other similar mechanisms.
   - **Direct Memory Access (DMA):** The Q35 vulnerability is similar to DMA attacks and requires access to certain hardware which is generally possible from Domain 0.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   -  **Ring 0 or equivalent privileges:** In the traditional sense, Ring 0 access (kernel-level) was required to directly manipulate the hypervisor memory, though this vulnerability can be exploited with access to the PCI configuration space of the device 0:0:0. 
   - **Access to PCI config space:** User-mode applications with access to the device config space can exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

   -   The blog mentions the initial advisory by Intel stated that only software running with ring 0 privilege could exploit this bug, but that was clarified to include situations where direct modification of hypervisor memory could happen before entering SMM, and that PCI config space access was enough to perform the attack.
   - Intel released a firmware patch to address the issue promptly after being made aware of the vulnerability.
   - The researchers initially withheld some technical details from their Black Hat presentation but intended to publish the full details, exploit code, and demos after the patch was released, which suggests the researchers had developed working exploits.
