  "CVE-2008-2361": {
    "description": "An integer overflow may occur in the computation of the  size of the glyph to be allocated by the ProcRenderCreateCursor() function which will cause less memory to be allocated than expected, leading later to dereferencing un-mapped memory, causing a crash of the X server.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the calculation of the glyph size within the `ProcRenderCreateCursor()` function.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer overflow",
         "Insufficient memory allocation",
         "Dereferencing un-mapped memory"
      ],
      "impact": "X server crash due to dereferencing unmapped memory.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious, authorized X client sends a specially crafted request to the X server.",
