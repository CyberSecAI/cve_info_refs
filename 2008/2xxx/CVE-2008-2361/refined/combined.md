Package        : xorg-server
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1377 CVE-2008-1379 CVE-2008-2360 CVE-2008-2361
                 CVE-2008-2362

Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X Window system.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2008-1377

    Lack of validation of the parameters of the
    SProcSecurityGenerateAuthorization SProcRecordCreateContext
    functions makes it possible for a specially crafted request to trigger
    the swapping of bytes outside the parameter of these requests, causing
    memory corruption.

CVE-2008-1379

    An integer overflow in the validation of the parameters of the
    ShmPutImage() request makes it possible to trigger the copy of
    arbitrary server memory to a pixmap that can subsequently be read by
    the client, to read arbitrary parts of the X server memory space.

CVE-2008-2360

    An integer overflow may occur in the computation of the size of the
    glyph to be allocated by the AllocateGlyph() function which will cause
    less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to later heap
    overflow.

CVE-2008-2361

    An integer overflow may occur in the computation of the  size of the
    glyph to be allocated by the ProcRenderCreateCursor() function which
    will cause less memory to be allocated than expected, leading later
    to dereferencing un-mapped memory, causing a crash of the X server.

CVE-2008-2362

    Integer overflows can also occur in the code validating the parameters
    for the SProcRenderCreateLinearGradient, SProcRenderCreateRadialGradient
    and SProcRenderCreateConicalGradient functions, leading to memory
    corruption by swapping bytes outside of the intended request
    parameters.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
2:1.1.1-21etch5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:1.4.1~git20080517-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your xorg-server package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHSA-2008:0502 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2008-06-11
Updated:
2008-06-11
# RHSA-2008:0502 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: XFree86 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated XFree86 packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

XFree86 is an implementation of the X Window System, which provides the
core functionality for the Linux graphical desktop.

An input validation flaw was discovered in X.org's Security and Record
extensions. A malicious authorized client could exploit this issue to cause
a denial of service (crash) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
root privileges on the X.Org server. (CVE-2008-1377)

Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in X.org's Render extension. A
malicious authorized client could exploit these issues to cause a denial of
service (crash) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with root
privileges on the X.Org server. (CVE-2008-2360, CVE-2008-2361)

An input validation flaw was discovered in X.org's MIT-SHM extension. A
client connected to the X.org server could read arbitrary server memory.
This could result in the sensitive data of other users of the X.org server
being disclosed. (CVE-2008-1379)

Users of XFree86 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-616-1: X.org vulnerabilities

13 June 2008

X.org vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [xorg-server](/security/cves?package=xorg-server) -

## Details

Multiple flaws were found in the RENDER, RECORD, and Security

extensions of X.org which did not correctly validate function arguments.

An authenticated attacker could send specially crafted requests and gain

root privileges or crash X. ([CVE-2008-1377](/security/CVE-2008-1377), [CVE-2008-2360](/security/CVE-2008-2360), [CVE-2008-2361](/security/CVE-2008-2361),

[CVE-2008-2362](/security/CVE-2008-2362))

It was discovered that the MIT-SHM extension of X.org did not correctly

validate the location of memory during an image copy. An authenticated

attacker could exploit this to read arbitrary memory locations within X,

exposing sensitive information. ([CVE-2008-1379](/security/CVE-2008-1379))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# X.Org X server: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200806-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X.Org X server,
possibly allowing for the remote execution of arbitrary code with root
privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-base/xorg-server** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.0.0-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.0.0-r6** |

### Background

The X Window System is a graphical windowing system based on a
client/server model.

### Description

Regenrecht reported multiple vulnerabilities in various X server
extensions via iDefense:

* The
  SProcSecurityGenerateAuthorization() and SProcRecordCreateContext()
  functions of the RECORD and Security extensions are lacking proper
  parameter validation (CVE-2008-1377).
* An integer overflow is
  possible in the function ShmPutImage() of the MIT-SHM extension
  (CVE-2008-1379).
* The RENDER extension contains several
  possible integer overflows in the AllocateGlyph() function
  (CVE-2008-2360) which could possibly lead to a heap-based buffer
  overflow. Further possible integer overflows have been found in the
  ProcRenderCreateCursor() function (CVE-2008-2361) as well as in the
  SProcRenderCreateLinearGradient(), SProcRenderCreateRadialGradient()
  and SProcRenderCreateConicalGradient() functions (CVE-2008-2362).

### Impact

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could possibly lead to the remote
execution of arbitrary code with root privileges, if the server is
running as root, which is the default. It is also possible to crash the
server by making use of these vulnerabilities.

### Workaround

It is possible to avoid these vulnerabilities by disabling the affected
server extensions. Therefore edit the configuration file
(/etc/X11/xorg.conf) to contain the following in the appropriate
places:

`Section "Extensions"
Option "MIT-SHM" "disable"
Option "RENDER" "disable"
Option "SECURITY" "disable"
EndSection
Section "Module"
Disable "record"
EndSection`
### Resolution

All X.org X Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-base/xorg-server-1.3.0.0-r6"
```

# NX: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200807-07**

NX uses code from the X.org X11 server which is prone to multiple
vulnerabilities.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/nxnode** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.2.0-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.2.0-r3** |

| Package | **net-misc/nx** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.2.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.2.0-r2** |

### Background

NoMachine's NX establishes remote connections to X11 desktops over
small bandwidth links. NX and NX Node are the compression core
libraries, whereas NX is used by FreeNX and NX Node by the binary-only
NX servers.

### Description

Multiple integer overflow and buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been
discovered in the X.Org X server as shipped by NX and NX Node (GLSA
200806-07).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities via unspecified
vectors, leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges
of the user on the machine running the NX server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All NX Node users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/nxnode-3.2.0-r3"
```

All NX users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/nx-3.2.0-r2"
```

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0504)

## Topic

Updated xorg-x11-server packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

X.Org is an open source implementation of the X Window System. It provides
basic low-level functionality that full-fledged graphical user interfaces
are designed upon.

An input validation flaw was discovered in X.org's Security and Record
extensions. A malicious authorized client could exploit this issue to cause
a denial of service (crash) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
root privileges on the X.Org server. (CVE-2008-1377)

Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in X.org's Render extension. A
malicious authorized client could exploit these issues to cause a denial of
service (crash) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with root
privileges on the X.Org server. (CVE-2008-2360, CVE-2008-2361,
CVE-2008-2362)

An input validation flaw was discovered in X.org's MIT-SHM extension. A
client connected to the X.org server could read arbitrary server memory.
This could result in the sensitive data of other users of the X.org server
being disclosed. (CVE-2008-1379)

Users of xorg-x11-server should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=448785#c0)  Josh Bressers    2008-05-28 19:39:13 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #445408](show_bug.cgi?id=445408) +++  iDefense reported several flaws in the X.org Render extension.  The iDefense advisory states:      Multiple vulnerabilities are present in the Render extension in the     code responsible for reading in client requests. The following     function contains the vulnerability:      SProcRenderCreateLinearGradient()      In each case, values are taken from the client request and used in     arithmetic operations that calculate the size of dynamic buffers. These     calculations can overflow, which results in undersized buffers being     allocated. The allocated buffers are then overflowed with data from the     client request.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=448785#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2008-06-11 18:24:36 UTC  ``` Public now:    <http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2008-June/036026.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=448785#c4)  Fedora Update System    2008-06-12 06:05:03 UTC  ``` xorg-x11-server-1.4.99.902-3.20080612.fc9 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 9   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=448785#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2008-06-12 08:52:45 UTC  ``` iDefense advisory:    <http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=720>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=448785#c6)  Fedora Update System    2008-06-13 02:18:10 UTC  ``` xorg-x11-server-1.4.99.902-3.20080612.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 testing repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Buttons should act like keyboard keys. And, we shouldn't put user traps
in where weird reconfiguration can result in stuck keys (as happened to
me with the mix of broken X and DGA).

I'm more interested in keeping things from breaking in the future than
weird counting buttons.

This isn't a usage count, it's a 'buttons pressed' count, which is
unique in my experience.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- xgl
xgl suffered from several Xorg security problems as it contains
copies of the code (CVE-2008-2360, CVE-2008-2361, CVE-2008-2362,
CVE-2008-1379, CVE-2008-1377)
- WebKitGtk,libQtWebKit4
A flaw in the CSS loader of the WebKit engine could crash programs
and potentially allowed execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2008-3632).
- libopensc2
The previous opensc security update (CVE-2008-2235) was
insufficient, therefore packages with additional fixes have been
released (CVE-2008-3972)
- pam\_mount
pam\_mount allowed users to mount arbitrary devices to any directory
when the 'luserconf' configuration directive was set (CVE-2008-3970).
- bluez-libs
Missing length checks in bluez-libs could cause a buffer overflow in
Bluetooth applications. Malicious bluetooth devices could
potentially exploit that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-2374).

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

may be required to view the information.

**238686**
Multiple security vulnerabilities in the Solaris X
Server Extensions may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS)
condition or allow Execution of Arbitrary Code

Product: Solaris 8 Operating System, Solaris 9 Operating System,
Solaris 10 Operating System, OpenSolaris

Category: Security

Date Released: 12-Jun-2008
<http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-66-238686-1>

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names
[CVE-2008-1377](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1377),
[CVE-2008-1379](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1379),
[CVE-2008-2360](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2360),

## 2. Avaya System Products using a Sun Microsystems Operating System:

Avaya system products include an
Operating System with the product
when it is delivered. Avaya
***Call Management System***
(CMS) and Avaya ***Interactive
Response*** (IR) are both shipped
with an operating system from Sun
Microsystems. Actions to be taken on
those products are described below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CMS | R12, R13/R13.1, R14 | Low | The suggested Sun workaround is implemented on CMS systems by default. See recommended actions below. This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya IR | 2.0 on Solaris 10, 3.0 | Low | On Solaris 10, the RENDER extension option is disabled on IR by default. If a customer has enabled the RENDER extension option, they may use the reported workaround to mitigate this issue. Since this is an unsupported configuration, Avaya will not be certifying the reported patches for use with IR. |

**Recommended Actions:**

For all vulnerable system products,
Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=448784#c0)  Josh Bressers    2008-05-28 19:33:47 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #445408](show_bug.cgi?id=445408) +++  iDefense reported several flaws in the X.org Render extension.  The iDefense advisory states:      Multiple vulnerabilities are present in the Render extension in the     code responsible for reading in client requests. The following     function contains the vulnerability:      ProcRenderCreateCursor()      In each case, values are taken from the client request and used in     arithmetic operations that calculate the size of dynamic buffers. These     calculations can overflow, which results in undersized buffers being     allocated. The allocated buffers are then overflowed with data from the     client request.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=448784#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2008-06-11 18:24:08 UTC  ``` Public now:    <http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2008-June/036026.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=448784#c4)  Fedora Update System    2008-06-12 06:05:01 UTC  ``` xorg-x11-server-1.4.99.902-3.20080612.fc9 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 9   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=448784#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2008-06-12 08:54:26 UTC  ``` iDefense advisory:    <http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=719>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=448784#c6)  Fedora Update System    2008-06-13 02:18:08 UTC  ``` xorg-x11-server-1.4.99.902-3.20080612.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 testing repository.
