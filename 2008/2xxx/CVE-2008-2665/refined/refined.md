Here's the information about CVE-2008-2665, extracted from the provided content:

**Title:** PHP 5.2.6 posix_access() (posix ext) safe_mode bypass

**Vulnerability:** Safe Mode Bypass

**Affected Software:** PHP 5.2.6

**Root Cause:**

*   The `posix_access()` function in PHP 5.2.6 can be bypassed when safe\_mode is enabled.
*   The vulnerability occurs due to the way the `expand_filepath()` function handles URLs (specifically, those starting with `http://`). This function changes the provided filename, e.g., "http://../../../etc/passwd", to a path like "/etc/passwd".
*   The `php_checkuid_ex()` function checks the original filename ("http://../../../etc/passwd"). The "http://" prefix causes `php_checkuid_ex()` to be bypassed, thus bypassing safe_mode restrictions.

**Attack Vector:**

*   By using a crafted filename with the "http://" prefix, an attacker can bypass safe\_mode checks.

**Impact:**

*   Allows an attacker to potentially access files that should be protected by safe\_mode.
*   Confidentiality impact is partial. Integrity and availability impacts are none.

**Example:**

```php
var_dump(posix_access("http://../../../etc/passwd"))==True
var_dump(posix_access("/etc/passwd"))==False
```

**Mitigation:**

*   The provided text suggests not relying on `safe_mode` as the primary security measure.
*   Upgrade to a patched version of PHP, as indicated by the Apple Security Update.
