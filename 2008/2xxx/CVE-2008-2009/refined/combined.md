| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=444443#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-04-28 13:42:36 UTC  ``` Will Drewry of the Google Security Team created a set of fuzzed OGG test files to test OGG Vorbis and Tremor implementations.  Some of them were causing memory corruption and crash on old libvorbis versions (prior to 1.0).  Crash / corruption occurred in _make_decode_tree().  This function was removed prior to the release of upstream version 1.0 in following changes:  <https://trac.xiph.org/changeset/2959> <https://trac.xiph.org/changeset/2960>  Test files do not crash libvobis revision 2960 or later.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=444443#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-04-28 13:53:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 303976](attachment.cgi?id=303976&action=diff "Patch from Monty (xiphmont)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=303976&action=edit "Patch from Monty (xiphmont)") Patch from Monty (xiphmont)  Patch adds _check_words, a dry-run variant of _make_words, that does performs huffman tree validation early in the stream decoding.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=444443#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2008-04-29 09:15:15 UTC  ``` Similar additional checks were committed to libvorbis trunk to reject underpopulated Huffman trees early in the file parsing:  <https://trac.xiph.org/changeset/14811>    ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=444443#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2008-05-14 07:30:48 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=444443#c10)  Red Hat Product Security    2008-05-14 07:38:21 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0271.html>     ``` |  |

# USN-861-1: libvorbis vulnerabilities

24 November 2009

libvorbis vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [libvorbis](/security/cves?package=libvorbis) -

## Details

It was discovered that libvorbis did not correctly handle ogg files with

underpopulated Huffman trees. If a user were tricked into opening a

specially crafted ogg file with an application that uses libvorbis, an

attacker could cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-2009](/security/CVE-2008-2009))

It was discovered that libvorbis did not correctly handle certain malformed

ogg files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted ogg file

with an application that uses libvorbis, an attacker could cause a denial

of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.

([CVE-2009-3379](/security/CVE-2009-3379))
