Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2087

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the `search_result.php` script of the Softbiz Web Host Directory Script.
*   The `host_id` parameter within this script is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. This is due to the failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`host_id` parameter) before using it in a database query.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The exploit details show this is a blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker does not receive direct results from the query, but can infer results based on the application's response or timing differences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **System Access:**  Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information within the database.
*   **Credentials Exposure:**  Specifically, an attacker can potentially retrieve the administrator's username and password in plain text from the `sb_host_admin` table.
*  **Partial Data Breach**: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to confidential data within the database.
*  **Partial Integrity Loss**: The attacker might be able to modify some data.
*  **Partial Availability Impact**:  Although not specified in detail the attacker might be able to conduct actions that impact availability of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `search_result.php` script.
*   **Malicious SQL Payload:**  The `host_id` parameter is manipulated with SQL injection syntax, typically using a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely via a web browser.
*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft the malicious injection.
*   **`magic_quotes` setting off:** Successful exploitation is easier if the `magic_quotes` setting in PHP is disabled on the target server.
