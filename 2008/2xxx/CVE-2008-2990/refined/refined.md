Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `facileforms.frame.php` file of the Joomla! Component FacileForms. Specifically, the `ff_compath` parameter is vulnerable to manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application allows an attacker to include remote files by manipulating the `ff_compath` parameter. This is a classic Remote File Inclusion vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to full control of the web server, including the ability to read and modify files, access the database, and potentially use the server for further attacks.
- **Data theft and manipulation**

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script (`facileforms.frame.php`) with the `ff_compath` parameter pointing to a malicious PHP file.
Example: `www.site.com/path/components/com_facileforms/facileforms.frame.php?ff_compath=[SH3LL]`
- The attack is remote and requires no authentication

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Ability to host a malicious file:** The attacker needs to have a web server hosting a malicious PHP file that can be included by the vulnerable application.
