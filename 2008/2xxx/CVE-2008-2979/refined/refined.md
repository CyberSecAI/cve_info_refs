Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-2979:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `links-extern.php` script in CiBlog 3.1 is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `id` parameter.

**Weakness:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `id` parameter of `links-extern.php` before being used in a SQL query.

**Impact:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data extraction, including usernames and passwords.
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Complete database compromise.

**Attack Vector:**
*   Remote exploitation via HTTP GET requests.
*   Attacker directly manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   No authentication is required for exploitation.

**Specific Details:**
*   The vulnerable URL is `links-extern.php`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
*   The provided exploit uses `UNION SELECT` to extract user and password data: `links-extern.php?id=-2+union+select+1,concat_ws(0x3a,user,password),1,1,1,1+from+user/*`
*  The content indicates that the vulnerability was discovered by Mr.SQL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as medium risk.
*   The exploitability subscore is high (8.6/10).
*   The confidentiality impact is none according to the CVSS score, but the content shows an example of extracting sensitive information such as usernames and passwords, so the confidentiality impact could be significant.
*   The integrity impact is partial, as attackers could modify the data in the database.
*   The availability impact is none.

The exploit-db.com content also lists CVE-2008-2979 as a related CVE for "ourvideo CMS 9.5" but the actual exploit details described relate to "ourvideo CMS 9.5" Remote File Inclusion / Local File Inclusion / Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities, and are thus unrelated to CVE-2008-2979.

The content from cxsecurity.com clearly provides more detail than the standard CVE description for CVE-2008-2979.
