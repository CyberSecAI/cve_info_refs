## libspf2 DNS TXT record parsing buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#183657

Original Release Date: 2008-10-30 | Last Revised: 2011-07-22

---

### Overview

libspf2 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in code that parses DNS TXT records.

### Description

| libspf2 is a widely-deployed implementation of the Sender Policy Framework. According to [RFC 4408](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4408.txt):   *An SPF record is a DNS Resource Record (RR) that declares which hosts are, and are not, authorized to use a domain name for the "HELO" and "MAIL FROM" identities. Loosely, the record partitions all hosts into permitted and not-permitted sets (though some hosts might fall into neither category).* libspf2 contins a buffer overflow in DNS TXT record parsing. According to [Doxpara Research](http://www.doxpara.com/?page_id=1256):  *DNS TXT records have long been a little tricky to parse, due to them containing two length fields. First, there is the length field of the record as a whole. Then, there is a sublength field, from 0 to 255, that describes the length of a particular character string inside the larger record. There is nothing that links the two values, and DNS servers to not themselves enforce sanity checks here. As such, there is always a risk that when receiving a DNS TXT record, the outer record length will be the amount allocated, but the inner length will be copied.* This issue is similar to [VU#814627](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/814627) "Sendmail vulnerable to buffer overflow when DNS map is specified using TXT records." |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a system running libspf2. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Vendors and those who directly use libspf2 should upgrade to [version 1.2.8](http://www.libspf2.org/docs/html/).Users that run a mail server or anti-spam products should consult their vendor for an appropriate patch. |

# libspf2: DNS response buffer overflow — GLSA **200810-03**

A memory management error in libspf2 might allow for remote execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-filter/libspf2** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.8** |

### Background

libspf2 is a library that implements the Sender Policy Framework,
allowing mail transfer agents to make sure that an email is authorized
by the domain name that it is coming from. Currently, only the exim MTA
uses libspf2 in Gentoo.

### Description

libspf2 uses a fixed-length buffer to receive DNS responses and does
not properly check the length of TXT records, leading to buffer
overflows.

### Impact

A remote attacker could store a specially crafted DNS entry and entice
a user or automated system using libspf2 to lookup that SPF entry (e.g.
by sending an email to the MTA), possibly allowing for the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libspf2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-filter/libspf2-1.2.8"
```

Package        : libspf2
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-2469

Dan Kaminsky discovered that libspf2, an implementation of the Sender
Policy Framework (SPF) used by mail servers for mail filtering, handles
malformed TXT records incorrectly, leading to a buffer overflow
condition (CVE-2008-2469).

Note that the SPF configuration template in Debian's Exim configuration
recommends to use libmail-spf-query-perl, which does not suffer from
this issue.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.5-4+etch1.

For the testing distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.5.dfsg-5+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your libspf2 package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
Advisory:  DNS TXT Record Parsing Bug in LibSPF2
Author:  Dan Kaminsky, Director of Penetration Testing, IOActive Inc,
Dan.Kaminsky@ioactive.com (PGP Key In Appendix)
Abstract:

A relatively common bug parsing TXT records delivered over DNS, dating
at least back to 2002 in Sendmail 8.2.0 and almost certainly much
earlier, has been found in LibSPF2, a library frequently used to
retrieve SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records and apply policy
according to those records.  This implementation flaw allows for
relatively flexible memory corruption, and should thus be treated as a
path to anonymous remote code execution.  Of particular note is that the
remote code execution would occur on servers specifically designed to
receive E-Mail from the Internet, and that these systems may in fact be
high volume mail exchangers.  This creates privacy implications.  It is
also the case that a corrupted email server is a useful â€œjumping offâ€
point for attackers to corrupt desktop machines, since attachments can
be corrupted with malware while the containing message stays intact.  So
there are internal security implications as well, above and beyond
corruption of the mail server on the DMZ.

Recommendations:

If you are a major mail exchange, you should determine whether the SPAM
filters that protect your systems use LibSPF2.

If you are a vendor of anti-SPAM devices, or the author of an operating
system with components that may use LibSPF2, you should determine
whether LibSPF2 is used in any of your configurations and migrate to
LibSPF 1.2.8, found at:

    http://www.libspf2.org/index.html

If your product has a dependency on DNS TXT records, we recommend you
test it for the parsing bug that LibSPF2 was vulnerable to, since this
has been a problem for some time.  Name server implementations may want
to consider adding filtering themselves, though record validation is not
normally their job.

Details:  DNS TXT records have long been a little tricky to parse, due
to them containing two length fields.  First, there is the length field
of the record as a whole.  Then, there is a sublength field, from 0 to
255, that describes the length of a particular character string inside
the larger record.  There is nothing that links the two values, and DNS
servers to not themselves enforce sanity checks here.  As such, there is
always a risk that when receiving a DNS TXT record, the outer record
length will be the amount allocated, but the inner length will be copied.

In the past, weâ€™ve seen this particular bug all over the place,
including in Sendmail.  This is just the same bug, showing up in LibSPF2
1.2.5:

Spf_dns_resolv.c#SPF_dns_resolv_lookup():

           case ns_t_txt:
           if ( rdlen > 1 )
           {
               u_char *src, *dst;
               size_t len;

               if ( SPF_dns_rr_buf_realloc( spfrr, cnt, rdlen ) !=
SPF_E_SUCCESS ) // allocate rdlen bytes at spf->rr[cn]->txt
               return spfrr;

               dst = spfrr->rr[cnt]->txt;
               len = 0;
               src = (u_char *)rdata;
               while ( rdlen > 0 )
               {
               len = *src; // get a second length from the attacker
controlled datastream -- some value from 0 to 255, unbound to rdlen
               src++;
               memcpy( dst, src, len ); // copy that second length to
rdlen byte buffer.
               dst += len;
               src += len;
               rdlen -= len + 1;
               }
               *dst = '\0';

 For validation purposes, a build of LibSPF2 was instrumented, to
validate the heap overflow:

$ ./spfquery -ip=1.2.3.4 -sender=foo@bar.toorrr.com
buffer 8107080 has size 16
buffer 8107090 has size 16
buffer 81070a0 has size 16
writing 255 bytes to a 15 size buffer at 81070a0 // overflow
buffer 8123030 has size 234
writing 233 bytes to a 234 size buffer at 8123030
buffer 81060c0 has size 20
buffer 81060e0 has size 20
buffer 8123120 has size 234
buffer 8106100 has size 31
StartError
Context: Failed to query MAIL-FROM
ErrorCode: (2) Could not find a valid SPF record
Error: Invalid character in middle of mechanism near 'Ã€
                                                       bar.toorrr'
Error: Failed to compile SPF record for 'bar.toorrr.com'
EndError
(invalid)

The actual record used to spawn this behavior was as follows:

;; HEADER SECTION
;; id = 63838
;; qr = 1    opcode = QUERY    aa = 1    tc = 0    rd = 1
;; ra = 0    ad = 0    cd = 0    rcode  = NOERROR
;; qdcount = 1  ancount = 2  nscount = 0  arcount = 0

;; QUESTION SECTION (1 record)
;; bar.toorrr.com.      IN      TXT

;; ANSWER SECTION (2 records)
bar.toorrr.com. 0       IN      TXT     "v=spf1 mx +all"
bar.toorrr.com. 0       IN      TXT
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"

;; AUTHORITY SECTION (0 records)

;; ADDITIONAL SECTION (0 records)

The altered length field, on 0x2C, is whatâ€™s causing the overflow.
Sample code to reproduce the above is attached at the end of this paper.

Conclusion:

Thereâ€™s nothing particularly special about this bug â€“ weâ€™ve even seen
this in mail servers before.  But it is apparently present on some very
high profile and high traffic systems.  SPF is a major part of how the
Internet attempts to filter SPAM, and while itâ€™s not perfect, it is
pretty helpful.  LibSPF2 is one of the more common libraries out there
for handling SPF traffic, with billions of messages a day being
protected by it.

Unfortunately, that also means billions of messages a day are at risk â€“
the nature of this flaw is such that an attacker can force arbitrary (or
at least ASCII encoded, though no nameservers have been found that
enforce ASCII) bytes to be copied into a buffer too small to contain
them.  This is a straightforward anonymous remote code execution find,
made interesting specifically by where the bug happens to be.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

Security changes in the new upcoming release are:

1) responsebuf is now dynamically allocated, avoiding a buffer overrun found and published by openwave.

2) txt record lengths are now handled properly, avoiding a remote exploit.

#2 is the private one.

I have the code and will prepare debdiffs. I don't have a precise embargo date for this yet. Still working on that.

I'm still waiting to hear back from Dan, but CERT want to make this into

a CVE. I'm also travelling for work next week, although I'll be on

email, I hope.

I'm tempted to put this out as a quiet security update in both

distributions, preferably in advance of the fanfare, I don't want a CVE

coming out before Debian have released the patch. On the other hand, I

have agreed to wait for Dan.

I've run out of time. I'll be offline from Friday or Saturday until the following Saturday or Sunday. Shevek has kees and jdstrand's email addresses and is supposed to mail you when it can be release. These are simple diffs to bring the affected file up to the proposed 1.2.6 version. Clearly it can be reduced. Magnus Holmgrem, the Debian Maintainer is working on a minimal patch. Attached is the non-reduced diff for the security fixes for all current distros. For Feisty - Intrepid they are to be applied after the last current patch for each release. Dapper has no patch system, so it's just a direct diff.

Or I'll deal with Intrepid after I get back, but here's a patch anyway.

I'm back online with no word on when this goes public. As you can see, there is a CVE number now. Sunday PM or Monday I'll be able to roll actual debdiffs based on the reduced patch it looks like Debian will use.

Intrepid. This one I installed and tested using spfquery and it works. I did not try to recreate the exploit. Dan Kaminsky reviewed the upstream changes this patch is based on and this patch, so I'm not about to second guess him.

Thanks for your hard work Scott. I have been able to find libspf2-1.2.8.tar.gz on the net, which includes these patches, so I am going to mark this public.

Couple of things:

1. the dapper debdiff should use 1.2.5-3ubuntu0.1 as the version

2. the uploaded hardy debdiff was actually the intrepid debdiff

3. we now use a different changelog format as per <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityUpdateProcedures>. This won't affect this upload, but thought you'd like to know

I have adjusted the dapper version and created a hardy debdiff based on intrepid, since they are both based on version 1.2.5.

I also just noticed that hardy and gutsy both have a release version of 1.2.5.dfsg-4. Therefore, the gutsy update should have 1.2.5.dfsg-4ubuntu.0.7.10.1 and hardy 1.2.5.dfsg-4ubuntu.0.8.04.1. I'll fix that as well and upload shortly.
