  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "exploit-db.com",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insecure handling of user inputs in the login and file inclusion functionalities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection: The login bypass vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the SQL query that is constructed using the 'email' and 'password' POST parameters.",
        "Local File Inclusion: The LFI vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation of the 'op' parameter before including a file based on it."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the application. Additionally, the LFI allows reading of sensitive files on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Authentication bypass can be achieved through a crafted SQL injection in the login form.",
        "LFI can be triggered by supplying a manipulated 'op' parameter with a path to a file."
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send HTTP POST requests to the login page with crafted 'email' and 'password' parameters, or a HTTP GET request to the vulnerable page with a crafted 'op' parameter."
