{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control in the `useradded.php` script, allowing unauthorized users to add new administrative accounts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary user creation",
    "Lack of authentication/authorization",
    "Direct access to user creation functionality"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can create an administrative user, granting them full control over the Pet Grooming Management System application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a POST request to the `useradded.php` script with parameters for the new admin account, directly through a web browser or using a script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application."
