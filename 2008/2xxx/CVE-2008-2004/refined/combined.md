How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Revision: 4277
          <http://svn.sv.gnu.org/viewvc/?view=rev&root=qemu&revision=4277>
Author:   aurel32
Date:     2008-04-28 20:26:45 +0000 (Mon, 28 Apr 2008)

Log Message:
-----------
add format= to drive options (CVE-2008-2004)

It is possible for a guest with a raw formatted disk image to write a
header to that disk image describing another format (such as qcow2).
Stopping and subsequent restart of the guest will cause qemu to detect
that format, and could allow the guest to read any host file if qemu is
sufficiently privileged (typical in virt environments).

The patch defaults to existing behaviour (probing based on file contents),
so it still requires the mgmt app (e.g. libvirt xml) to pass a new
"format=raw" parameter for raw disk images.

Originally noted by Avi Kivity, patch from Chris Wright.

| Log Message: | ``` add format= to drive options (CVE-2008-2004)  It is possible for a guest with a raw formatted disk image to write a header to that disk image describing another format (such as qcow2). Stopping and subsequent restart of the guest will cause qemu to detect that format, and could allow the guest to read any host file if qemu is sufficiently privileged (typical in virt environments).  The patch defaults to existing behaviour (probing based on file contents), so it still requires the mgmt app (e.g. libvirt xml) to pass a new "format=raw" parameter for raw disk images.  Originally noted by Avi Kivity, patch from Chris Wright.  ``` |

# USN-776-1: KVM vulnerabilities

12 May 2009

KVM vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [kvm](/security/cves?package=kvm) -

## Details

Avi Kivity discovered that KVM did not correctly handle certain disk

formats. A local attacker could attach a malicious partition that

would allow the guest VM to read files on the VM host. ([CVE-2008-1945](/security/CVE-2008-1945),

[CVE-2008-2004](/security/CVE-2008-2004))

Alfredo Ortega discovered that KVM's VNC protocol handler did not

correctly validate certain messages. A remote attacker could send

specially crafted VNC messages that would cause KVM to consume CPU

resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-2382](/security/CVE-2008-2382))

Jan Niehusmann discovered that KVM's Cirrus VGA implementation over VNC

did not correctly handle certain bitblt operations. A local attacker

could exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code on the VM

host or crash KVM, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-4539](/security/CVE-2008-4539))

It was discovered that KVM's VNC password checks did not use the correct

length. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause KVM to crash,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5714](/security/CVE-2008-5714))
