```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - SQL Injection: The `showpost.php` script uses unsanitized input from the `post_id` parameter directly in an SQL query, allowing for SQL injection.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Multiple scripts, including `register.php`, `reminder.php`, and `search.php`, are vulnerable to XSS via URL parameters and POST parameters.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - SQL Injection: Unsanitized user-supplied data is directly embedded into an SQL query.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Lack of proper input sanitization/encoding allows malicious scripts to be injected and executed.

- Impact of exploitation:
    - SQL Injection: Attackers can potentially read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands. The provided exploit example retrieves usernames and passwords from the database.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Attackers can execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or phishing attacks.

- Attack vectors:
    - SQL Injection: The `post` parameter in `showpost.php` via HTTP GET requests.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
        - Via URL in `register.php`, `reminder.php`, and `search.php`
        - Via POST parameters `uname`, `email`, `email2` in `register.php`; `email` in `reminder.php`; `keywords` in `search.php`.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - For both SQL Injection and XSS: The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and must know the application's URL and the vulnerable parameters.
