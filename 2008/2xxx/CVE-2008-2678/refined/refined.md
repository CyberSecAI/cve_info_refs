{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful SQL injection allows an attacker to bypass authentication, read database contents, modify/delete data or potentially gain full server access. XSS can be used to execute malicious scripts in the browsers of other users.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests with malicious parameters via the URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges required."
