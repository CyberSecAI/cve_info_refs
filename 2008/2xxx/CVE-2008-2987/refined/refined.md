Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple issues within Benja CMS 0.1, including broken authentication, arbitrary file upload, and cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Authentication:** Anonymous users can access the administrative control panel, allowing them to add or delete menus. This indicates a lack of proper authentication mechanisms and access controls.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The application allows arbitrary file uploads through the `upload.php` script in the admin directory. This enables attackers to upload malicious files, such as PHP shell scripts, to the server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks through the `admin_edit_submenu.php`, `admin_new_submenu.php`, and `admin_edit_topmenu.php` scripts in the admin directory. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete compromise of the CMS:** Attackers can gain complete control of the CMS through the various vulnerabilities.
*   **Administrative control:** The broken authentication allows attackers to manipulate the website's menu structure, defacing the website or inserting malicious links.
*  **Remote Code Execution:** Arbitrary file upload enables attackers to upload and execute malicious code, gaining remote control of the server.
*   **Data theft:** XSS attacks can be used to steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information from legitimate users.
*   **Website defacement:** XSS and file upload can be used to deface the website or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** All of these vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely through the web interface of the application.
*   **Direct URL manipulation:** XSS attacks can be injected directly into the URL by appending malicious code to vulnerable php scripts
*   **File upload:** Attackers upload malicious php files through the upload script to get remote code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs access to the web interface of the application
*   **Basic web skills:** Basic skills for manipulating urls and uploading files are needed to perform the exploit.
*   **No special user privileges:** The application does not require any specific privileges to exploit the vulnerabilities, since anonymous users can access the vulnerable functions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates that the vulnerabilities are rated as a "High" risk.
*   The issue is also associated with CWE-264 (Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls), CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting), and CWE-94 (Code Injection).
*   The exploit locations are in the admin directory, but the broken authentication allows unprivileged users to reach this area.
*   The exploit was reported on June 22, 2008
