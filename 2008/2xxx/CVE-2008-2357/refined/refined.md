Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-2357:

**Root Cause:**

*   A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `split_redraw()` function within the `split.c` file of the `mtr` utility. This function is called when `mtr` is invoked with the `-p` (or `--split`) command line option.
*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of `sprintf()` to format a string using the hostname looked up via DNS. The `sprintf` function does not perform bounds checking which allows it to write past the end of a buffer.
* The vulnerable code snippet is:
  ```c
  char  newLine[MAX_LINE_SIZE];
   ...
  if(name != NULL) {
        /* May be we should test name's length */         [!!]
        sprintf(newLine, "%s %d %d %d %d %d %d", name,    [2]
                net_loss(at),
                net_returned(at), net_xmit(at),
                net_best(at) /1000, net_avg(at)/1000,
                net_worst(at)/1000);
  }
  ```
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the DNS server provides an overly long hostname, and the `dn_expand` function within the `libresolv` library returns a large string. The `ns_name_ntop` function, which `dn_expand` uses, does not prevent a large response when a special flag is set, allowing an attacker to generate a very large string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack buffer overflow. Data written by the `sprintf()` operation exceeds the allocated buffer `newLine` size (256 bytes), corrupting the stack.
*   **Insecure string formatting:** The use of `sprintf()` without proper bounds checking is a major weakness. This is the primary cause of the overflow.
*  **Insecure DNS handling**: The code does not validate the size of the response returned by the `dn_expand` function.
*   **Reliance on `libresolv`:** The vulnerability is partly due to a weakness in `libresolv` where the `ns_name_ntop` function can generate extremely large output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `mtr` process, which typically runs with root privileges due to being a setuid executable.
*   **System compromise:** This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, system manipulation, and malware installation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote DNS poisoning:** A remote attacker can control the DNS server used by the victim and supply a malicious DNS PTR record for a hostname that the user will supply to mtr on the command line.
*  **DNS spoofing:** Attackers can attempt to spoof DNS responses in order to inject malicious PTR records.
*   **Command line argument:** The user must invoke `mtr` with the `-p` option (or `--split`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over DNS server:** The attacker must control or be able to influence the DNS server used by the victim.
*   **Knowledge of target IP or ability to spoof DNS responses:** The attacker needs to know the IP address the victim user will provide to mtr, or they must be able to spoof the DNS response.
*   **Ability to craft malicious DNS response:** The attacker must be capable of generating a DNS PTR record that will trigger the vulnerability by causing the `ns_name_ntop` function in `libresolv` to return a large string, causing a buffer overflow in the `mtr` program.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in `mtr` version 0.73 by replacing `sprintf` with `snprintf`, which prevents writing past the end of the buffer by checking the length of the input.
*   The issue is partly within the `libresolv` library, but the immediate fix was applied in `mtr` since its use of `sprintf` was the main trigger.
* The issue can also be triggered locally if the attacker can control the DNS server the target system is using.
