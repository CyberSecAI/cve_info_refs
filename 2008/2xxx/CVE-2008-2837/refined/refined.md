Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `menuclick` parameter of the `index.php` file in CMS-BRD. This parameter is vulnerable to SQL Injection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection. The application does not properly sanitize user input passed through the `menuclick` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries. This allows them to retrieve sensitive information such as database usernames, database names, and database versions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a malicious SQL query injected into the `menuclick` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely. They only need to send a specifically crafted request to the vulnerable web server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable URL is `http://site.com/index.php?lang=en&menuclick=-1+UNION+SELECT+concat_ws(char(58),USER(),DATABASE(),VERSION())/*`
*   The SQL injection is performed by using a `UNION SELECT` statement, and by using `concat_ws` function to combine information.
