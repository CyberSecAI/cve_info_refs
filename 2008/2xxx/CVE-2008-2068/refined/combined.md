How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# WordPress 2.5.1

---

Version 2.5.1 of WordPress is now available. It includes a number of bug fixes, performance enhancements, and one very important security fix. We recommend everyone update immediately, particularly if your blog has open registration. The vulnerability is not public but it will be shortly.

In addition to the security fix, 2.5.1 contains many bug fixes. If you are interested only in the security fixes, you can download these corrected copies of [wp-includes/pluggable.php](https://trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/2.5.1/wp-includes/pluggable.php?format=raw), [wp-admin/includes/media.php](https://trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/2.5.1/wp-admin/includes/media.php?format=raw), and [wp-admin/media.php](https://trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/2.5.1/wp-admin/media.php?format=raw). Replace your existing copies of these files with these new copies.

If you download the entire 2.5.1 release, you will be getting [over 70 other fixes](https://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=2.5.1&resolution=fixed&order=priority). 2.5.1 focuses on fixing the most annoying bugs and improving performance. Here are some highlights:

* Performance improvements for the Dashboard, Write Post, and Edit Comments pages.
* Better performance for those who have many categories
* Media Uploader fixes
* An upgrade to TinyMCE 3.0.7
* Widget Administration fixes
* Various usability improvements
* Layout fixes for IE

### Secret lives of blogs

Since 2.5 your `wp-config.php` file allows a new constant called `SECRET_KEY` which basically is meant to introduce a little permanent randomness into the cryptographic functions used for cookies in WordPress. You can [visit this link we set up to get a unique secret key](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.0/) for your config file. (It’s unique and random on every page load.) Having this line in your config file helps secure your blog.

Many thanks to [Steven Murdoch](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/) for responsibly reporting the security issue (CVE-2008-1930) and Alex Concha for reporting an XSS issue.
