Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-2958:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure creation of temporary directories by `checkinstall` and `installwatch`. Instead of using the secure `mktemp` utility, they manually create temporary directories using `awk` and random character generation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The manual creation of temporary directories introduces a race condition. An attacker could potentially create a symbolic link to a different location with the same name as the intended temporary directory between the time the name is generated and the directory is created.
*   **Symlink Attack:** The vulnerability allows for a symlink attack where a malicious user can create a symbolic link that would cause `checkinstall` or `installwatch` to write to an unintended location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** By exploiting the race condition and symlink attack, a local user could overwrite arbitrary files on the system.
*   **Other Impacts:** The vulnerability also has the potential for other unspecified impacts, likely related to the ability to control where the application writes files. This could include other forms of privilege escalation and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system.
*   **Symlink Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create symbolic links in the temporary directory location before `checkinstall` or `installwatch` attempts to create its temporary directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   A local user on the system with the ability to write to the base temporary directory, usually `/tmp` or `/var/tmp`.
*   The attacker needs to be able to anticipate or create the symlink before the vulnerable applications creates the temporary directory, due to the race condition.

**Additional Notes**

* The fix involves replacing the manual temp directory creation with `mktemp`, which mitigates the race condition vulnerability.
* The severity was rated as "grave" because it can lead to arbitrary file overwrites.
