Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in Xigla products:

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The root cause of the SQL injection vulnerabilities is the improper handling of user-supplied input in SQL queries. Specifically, the `orderby` parameter and the `categoryid` parameter in various ASP scripts are vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or data theft.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The XSS vulnerabilities stem from the lack of proper input sanitization in various ASP pages. Input fields are not being encoded or filtered, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code that can be executed by other users within the context of the vulnerable web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple ASP scripts across several Xigla products are vulnerable to SQL injection via parameters such as `orderby` and `categoryid`. These include:
    *   `search.asp` in Absolute Live Support XE
    *   `search.asp` in Absolute News Manager XE
    *   `searchbanners.asp` in Absolute Banner Manager XE
    *   `search.asp` in Absolute Form Processor XE
    *   `gallery.asp` in Absolute Image Gallery XE
    *   `search.asp` in Absolute Poll Manager XE
*  **XSS:** Multiple ASP scripts across several Xigla products are vulnerable to XSS.  These include:
    *   `search.asp` in Absolute Live Support XE
    *   `anmviewer.asp`, `search.asp`,`editarticleX.asp`,`publishers.asp` in Absolute News Manager XE
    *   `searchbanners.asp`,`listadvertisers.asp` in Absolute Banner Manager XE
    *   `search.asp`, `users.asp` in Absolute Form Processor XE
    *   `gallery.asp`, `search.asp` in Absolute Image Gallery XE
    *   `search.asp` in Absolute Poll Manager XE
    *  `users.asp` in Absolute Control Panel XE

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the database.
    *   Modify or delete sensitive data.
    *   Potentially gain access to the underlying server.
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
    *   Steal user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface websites.
    *   Perform other malicious actions within the user's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into vulnerable parameters via HTTP requests.
*   **XSS:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into input fields that is then displayed to other users through HTTP responses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the application and the ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable scripts.
*  No special privileges are needed to exploit the XSS vulnerabilities
*  Knowledge of basic SQL and JavaScript, and web development would be beneficial.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability report mentions that all fields on certain pages are vulnerable to XSS, indicating a widespread lack of input sanitization.
* The products are identified by version numbers, indicating that older versions are vulnerable.
* The identified vulnerabilities affect the ASP versions of the products.
* The vendor is listed as Xigla.
