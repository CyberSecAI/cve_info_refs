Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Internet Explorer handles access to frames (specifically IFRAMEs) within a web page. It fails to properly enforce the cross-domain security model.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Domain Access:** Internet Explorer allows scripts from one domain to manipulate certain aspects of IFRAMEs from a different domain. While the browser appears to enforce the Same-Origin Policy (preventing access to cookies and HTML content), it does not restrict access to non-domain specific events, such as the `onmousedown` event.
*   **Bypassing Location Change Restriction:**  IE had a protection against setting the location of an iframe by off-domain scripts if the location was provided as a string. This protection can be bypassed by providing the location as an object that has a `toString` method that returns the desired new location, making the browser believe the location is not a string, and thus not protected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Keystroke Capture:** An attacker can use a malicious IFRAME to capture keystrokes entered in the parent document by monitoring the `onkeydown` event. This allows capturing sensitive information such as passwords.
*  **Modification of IFRAME Content:** Attackers can change the content of frames in other domains, thus allowing for possible phishing attacks or other malicious activities.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** While not explicitly detailed, the ability to manipulate frame content opens the door for more sophisticated attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can host a specially crafted HTML page containing a malicious script and an IFRAME.
*   **HTML Email:** An attacker can deliver an HTML email containing the malicious script and IFRAME.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open or interact with the malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious HTML content (either through a website or email).
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same domain as the victim, taking advantage of the cross-domain nature of the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 beta 1 (and possibly other versions, as noted in one of the blog posts that claims to target IE7.5730), but it is important to note that IE 8 was still beta at the time this vulnerability was published.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit was publicly available.
*   The exploit involves opening a new window, getting a reference to the `iframe` of the new window, and modifying its location using the `window.opener` property.
*   The bypass for IE's protection against off-domain location changes consists in setting the iframe's location to a non-string value.
