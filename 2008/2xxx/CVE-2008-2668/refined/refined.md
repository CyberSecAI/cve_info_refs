Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2668:

**Verification:**
The content from exploit-db.com explicitly mentions CVE-2008-2668, along with CVE-2008-2669, indicating that it is relevant to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerabilities arise from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `yBlog` application. This allows attackers to inject malicious code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in `search.php`, `user.php`, and `uss.php` files. This allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries and potentially extract sensitive information such as usernames and passwords from the `usuarios` table.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS in the same files (`search.php`, `user.php`, and `uss.php`). This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the context of the user's browser.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information like usernames and passwords.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the web page, redirection to malicious websites, or the execution of malicious code within a user's browser, potentially leading to further compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `q` parameter in `search.php`, the `n` parameter in `user.php`, and the `n` parameter in `uss.php`.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts through the same parameters (`q`, `n`) in the same vulnerable files.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `yBlog` application. No specific privileges are needed.
    *   The attacker must know the location of the vulnerable application and be able to access it over the network.

**Technical Details:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The exploit-db entry shows example SQL injection payloads using `UNION SELECT` statements to extract user information from the database.
*   **XSS:** The exploit-db entry provides sample XSS payloads using `<script>alert(/xss/)</script>` which would execute Javascript on the user's browser.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides specific examples of how to exploit the vulnerabilities in each file using both GET and POST requests.
*   The vulnerable software is `yBlog` version `0.2.2.2`.
*   The exploit information is dated 2008-06-10.
*   The exploit-db entry states that it is for educational purposes only and should not be used for illegal activities.

**Summary:**

The `yBlog` application version `0.2.2.2` suffers from multiple vulnerabilities including SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting. The lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied parameters is the root cause of these issues. An attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to potentially gain access to sensitive information, manipulate data, or execute malicious scripts on users' browsers.
