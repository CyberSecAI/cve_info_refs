Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-2165:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A non-persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `AccessCodeStart.asp` page of the Cisco Building Broadband Service Manager (BBSM) Captive Portal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing a malicious user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the `msg` parameter of the `AccessCodeStart.asp` page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they access the vulnerable `AccessCodeStart.asp` page. This can potentially allow the attacker to:
   - Steal session cookies
   - Gain access to sensitive client information
   - Redirect users to malicious sites
   - Perform other actions within the user's session context

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and requires an attacker to craft a malicious URL that includes the injected JavaScript within the `msg` parameter of `AccessCodeStart.asp`.
  - Example malicious URL: `http://host/ekgnkm/AccessCodeStart.asp?msg=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22XSS%22);%3C/script%3E`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any authentication.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to entice the victim to click on the malicious link or to use a method that automatically loads the malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as low risk, with a CVSS base score of 4.3/10 and an exploitability subscore of 8.6/10, but a low impact subscore of 2.9/10.
