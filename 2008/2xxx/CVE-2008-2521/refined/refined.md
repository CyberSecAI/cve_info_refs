Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2521:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `fid` parameter within the `/members.php` page of the Mega File Hosting Script version 1.2.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The script fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the `fid` parameter, which is then directly used in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (`user`, `email`, and `pass` from the `users` table), administrator credentials (`admin`, `pass` from the `setting` table), and FTP server information (`user`, `pass` from the `server` table).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `/members.php` page with a crafted `fid` parameter containing malicious SQL code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have a registered account on the vulnerable application.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Exploitation Steps (from exploit-db.com):**

1.  Register an account on the vulnerable application.
2.  Log in and navigate to `/members.php?folders=1`.
3.  Create a folder with any name.
4.  Exploit the SQL injection vulnerability using the following techniques:
    *   **Retrieve User Info:** `/members.php?folders=1&fid=-1+union+all+select+1,2,concat(user,0x3a,email),pass,5,6,7,8+from+users+--`
    *   **Retrieve Admin Info:** `/members.php?folders=1&fid=-1+union+all+select+1,2,admin,pass,5,6,7,8+from+setting+--`
    *   **Retrieve FTP Server Info:** `/members.php?folders=1&fid=-1+union+all+select+1,2,user,pass,5,6,7,8+from+server+--`

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit-db.com entry provides a dork for identifying vulnerable installations of the Mega File Hosting Script: `"Powered by: MFH v1"`.
*   The exploit was initially published on milw0rm.com on 2008-05-12.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a classic SQL injection flaw, allowing an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database. The attacker needs a registered account on the application to exploit the vulnerability.
