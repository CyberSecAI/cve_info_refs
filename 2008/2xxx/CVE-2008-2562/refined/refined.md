Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2562

**Vulnerable Software:** Power Phlogger <= 2.2.5

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `edCss.php` file of Power Phlogger, where the `css_str` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate database queries.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `css_str` parameter is not properly sanitized, which enables the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords (hashes), and other potentially confidential data from the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the database, an attacker could potentially gain higher privileges or create new admin accounts.
- **System Compromise:** In severe cases, it might be possible for an attacker to gain control of the application or underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request with an injected SQL query in the `css_str` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the web application.
- **User Account:** The attacker must have a user account on the web application, which can be freely obtained via an open registration form.
- **Knowledge of Application:**  The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter (`css_str`) and the structure of the application's database to craft a successful exploit.

**Technical Details (from exploit-db):**
The exploit example provided in exploit-db uses a crafted URL:
`http://site/edCss.php?css_str=-1%20union%20select%20null,null,id,username,pw,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null%20from%20pphl_users%20limit%200,1&action=edit`

This URL demonstrates how the `css_str` parameter can be used to inject a `UNION SELECT` query to retrieve user information (`id`, `username`, `pw` from the `pphl_users` table).
