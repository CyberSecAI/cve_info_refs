Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-2281:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper URL validation within Internet Explorer's "Print Table of Links" feature. This feature, when enabled, generates an HTML table containing links from the webpage being printed. The script responsible for this process takes the text within link tags but does not sanitize or validate the URLs themselves before adding them to the generated HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Zone Scripting:** The primary vulnerability is Cross-Zone Scripting. The local resource script responsible for generating the print table of links runs in the "Local Machine Zone," which has significantly higher privileges than the "Internet Zone" where webpages typically reside. This allows injected scripts to execute with elevated privileges.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the absence of proper sanitization and validation of URLs before including them in the generated HTML. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code within a URL.
- **Code Injection:** By injecting script code within the URL of a link, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine when the user prints the page with "Print Table of Links" enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine with the privileges of the Local Machine Zone. This could lead to complete compromise of the system.
- **Information Leakage (Partial):** On systems with User Account Control (UAC) enabled, the vulnerability may be partially mitigated, resulting in information leakage rather than full code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted Links:** Attackers can inject malicious links into webpages hosted on their own sites, comments on blogs, social networks, wikis, or any other medium where links can be embedded.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires user interaction - specifically, the user must print the webpage with the "Print Table of Links" feature enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Insert Links:** The attacker needs the capability to embed a link containing malicious script into a webpage.
- **No Special Access:** The attacker does not need access to the victim's system or network. The attack is delivered via a website or other medium where the user can encounter and click on a link.
- **Social Engineering:** While not strictly necessary, the attacker may need to socially engineer the user into visiting the page and printing with the feature enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 7.0 and 8.0 beta on fully patched Windows XP systems. It may also affect earlier versions of Internet Explorer.
- Windows Vista with UAC enabled is partially affected, with a risk of information leakage.
- The exploit relies on the use of the `ActiveXObject` to execute commands, demonstrating the severity of the potential damage.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is provided that shows how to execute the Windows Calculator by injecting script code into a link.

This vulnerability is a significant security risk due to the ease of exploitation and the potential for complete system compromise.
