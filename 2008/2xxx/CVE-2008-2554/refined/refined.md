Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2008-2554:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the `id` and `cat` parameters of the `template_permalink.asp` and `template_archives_cat.asp` files, respectively.
- This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
- The specific vulnerability is a "blind" SQL injection, meaning that the attacker does not receive direct error messages from the database, but can infer the results of their queries by observing changes in the application's behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database (e.g., usernames and passwords).
-  An attacker can potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- The impact is rated as "High" with CVSS base score of 7.5/10.
- Partial impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability is noted.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via HTTP requests.
- The attack vectors are the `template_permalink.asp` and `template_archives_cat.asp` files via the `id` and `cat` parameters respectively.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to analyze the application response to identify differences that indicate successful SQL injection.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes examples of how to probe for the existence of tables, columns, and how to extract user credentials.
- The exploit uses techniques to infer results from blind SQL injections including `AND 1=1` and `AND 1=2` to determine boolean responses, as well as `SELECT Count(*)` and `exists (select *)` to probe for tables and columns.
- The content mentions the use of `sqlmap` to automate the exploitation process.
-  The vulnerable application is identified as "bp blog" version 6.0.
