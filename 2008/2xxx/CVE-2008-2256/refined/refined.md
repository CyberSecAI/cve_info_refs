Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2008-2256:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer attempting to access an object that has either not been initialized or has been deleted. This leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uninitialized memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability can gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted webpage that exploits the vulnerability when viewed with Internet Explorer.
- Attackers could host malicious websites or compromise legitimate websites to host the exploit content.
- Users need to be convinced to visit the malicious webpage, usually by clicking a link in an email or instant message.
- It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and host malicious web content.
- The attacker needs to entice the user into visiting the malicious website, or the site needs to be already compromised.

**Mitigating Factors:**

- The document mentions a mitigating factor was added in the revision of the bulletin. However, it does not explicitly detail what this mitigating factor is.
- The document does state that users with fewer rights are less impacted than those with administrative rights.
