      "vulnerability": "SQL Injection",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The `catalog.php` script does not properly sanitize the `idp` and `category` parameters before using them in an SQL query.",

        "attack_vector": "By manipulating the `idp` parameter in the `catalog.php` URL.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a crafted URL to the vulnerable application."
