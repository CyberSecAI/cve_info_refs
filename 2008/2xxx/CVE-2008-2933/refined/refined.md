Someone who tried Firefox for a while and went back to their previous browser might end up with an old vulnerable Firefox, and an attacker might be able to use this trick to send the user to an exploit page.\nExamples that work in Safari on Windows:\ngopher:https://www.google.com|www.test.com|javascript:alert(1)\ngopher:https://www.google.com|www.test.com|chrome://browser/content/browser.xul\nAlthough Firefox 3 no longer registers for the gopher: protocol, neither does it appear to delete a pre-existing Firefox 2 registration.

For example, web browsers\nnormally handle `file:` URIs themselves, or block them from web\ncontent altogether, but this flaw enabled attackers to pass them from another\nbrowser into Firefox. In Firefox 2 scripts running from file: URIs can read\ndata from a user's entire disk, a risk if the attacker could first place a\nmalicious file in a guessable location on the local disk. Rios demonstrated that\nthe so-called \"Safari Carpet-bombing vulnerability\" could be used for this,\nas well as another technique that does not rely on that now-fixed Safari\nvulnerability.\n\nIn Firefox 3 scripts running in local files have limited access to\nother files, almost entirely mitigating the `file:` attack.\nHowever, combined with a vulnerability which allows an attacker to inject\nscript into a chrome document the above issue could be used to run\narbitrary code on a victim's computer. Such a chrome injection vulnerability\nwas discovered in Firefox 3 by Mozilla developers **Ben Turner**\nand **Dan Veditz**.
