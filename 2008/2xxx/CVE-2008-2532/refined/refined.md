- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in the `topic_detail.php` file of the AJ HYIP ACME application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection. The `id` parameter in the `topic_detail.php` file is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database including admin usernames and passwords, as well as member usernames and passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL of `topic_detail.php` with a crafted SQL injection payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and manipulate the URL parameters.

The provided exploit includes two example SQL injection payloads:
   - To extract admin information: `www.site.me/patch/forum/topic_detail.php?id=-999999+union+select+0,1,2,concat(username,0x3a,admin_password),4,5,6,7+from+admin/*`
   - To extract member information: `www.site.me/patch/forum/topic_detail.php?id=-999999+union+select+0,1,2,concat(username,0x3a,password),4,5,6,7+from+members/*`
