{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities including Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI): Improperly sanitized input allows inclusion of local files.",
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI): Improperly sanitized input allows inclusion of remote files.",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):  Improperly sanitized input allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to system access through RFI and LFI, and potentially to data exfiltration and other malicious activities through XSS. The impact for LFI and RFI is considered 'High' leading to potential system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "LFI": "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP files containing 'language' or 'thumb_template' parameters.",
        "RFI": "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP file containing 'thumb_template' parameter.",
      "XSS": "HTTP GET requests to specific PHP files with vulnerable parameters like 'error_meldung', 'feature_language[ueberschrift]', 'language_array[ueberschrift]', 'language_feature[titel]', 'language_feature[bildmenu]'."
    },
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application. The application's 'Register Globals' setting is noted as potentially being a factor (though it's not clarified in terms of impact)."
