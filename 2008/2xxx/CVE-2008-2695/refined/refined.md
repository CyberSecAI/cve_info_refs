Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in PHPInv 0.8.0:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `entry.php` script directly includes files based on the user-controlled `action` parameter without proper sanitization.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `search.php` script directly uses the user-controlled `keyword` parameter within the page output without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **LFI:** Lack of input sanitization of the `action` parameter in `entry.php`. Specifically, the code includes a file based on user input via `include("inc/entry_$action.php");`. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files by manipulating the $action parameter.
*   **XSS:** The `search.php` script doesn't sanitize the `keyword` parameter, which is then reflected back to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **LFI:**
    *   An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, which may contain sensitive information like configuration files, credentials, or source code.
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code if they can include a file with malicious code. In the example, the attacker can display PHP configuration information by including the `phpinfo.php` file, or read the server's password file `/etc/passwd`.
*   **XSS:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, hijacking user sessions, or redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **LFI:** By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `entry.php` with a manipulated `action` parameter (e.g., `action=../../../../etc/passwd%00` or `action=../../../../phpinfo`). The `%00` is a null byte injection that can truncate the file path on some systems.
*   **XSS:** By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `search.php` with a manipulated `keyword` parameter containing JavaScript code (e.g., `keyword=>"><script>alert(123);</script>`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **LFI:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `entry.php` script. They don't need to be authenticated.
*   **XSS:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `search.php` script. They don't need to be authenticated. A user needs to visit the crafted URL for the XSS payload to be executed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit demonstrates LFI with examples of including `/etc/passwd` and `phpinfo.php`.
*   The exploit demonstrates XSS with an example of injecting JavaScript to display an alert box.
*   The exploit mentions the use of a web proxy to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
