Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2252:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel's improper validation of input parameters passed from user mode to the kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation: The kernel fails to adequately validate parameters received from user mode processes.
- Memory Corruption: This lack of validation leads to memory corruption within the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Elevation of Privilege: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated (kernel-level) privileges.
- Full System Control: An attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
  - Install programs
  - View, change, or delete data
  - Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Attack: The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the vulnerable system.
- Exploitation via Crafted Application: The attacker exploits the vulnerability by running a specially crafted application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the system is required.
- The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008.
- The vulnerability is addressed by a security update that corrects the parameter validation issue in the kernel.
- Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.
- There was no known exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of the security bulletin release.
