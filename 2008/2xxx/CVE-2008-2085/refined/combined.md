How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

    498     return atoi(number);
    499 }

Looking at the code it is possible to cause a buffer overflow of number
by specifying a number to m=video that is larger than sizeof(number) bytes
because then end - begin will be > sizeof(number) and thus the strncpy call
int line 497 will overflow the number buffer. Or in other words, strncpy is
useless if used like this.

Adjusting severity.

Kind regards
Nico

BTW: the same issue affects get_remote_ip_media() and
get_remote_ipv6_media(), both unfixed in latest upstream
release (3.1) and the version in Debian:

    122 uint32_t get_remote_ip_media(char *msg)

    128     if (!begin) {
    129       /* Can't find what we're looking at -> return no address */
    130       return INADDR_NONE;
    131     }
    132     begin += sizeof("c=IN IP4 ") - 1;
    133     end = strstr(begin, "\r\n");
    134     if (!end)
    135       return INADDR_NONE;
    136     memset(ip, 0, 32);
    137     strncpy(ip, begin, end - begin);
    138     return inet_addr(ip);
    139 }

    145 uint8_t get_remote_ipv6_media(char *msg, struct in6_addr addr)
    146 {
    147     char pattern[] = "c=IN IP6 ";

Hi Steffen and Nico

Thank you for rapid mail.
Just now I have checked related process codes in sipp svn trunk.
Actually, (roughly counted), I found 6 wrong process lines.

I promise I will check and contact sipp author team.

This sounds like a different issue than [CVE-2008-1959](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1959), which was already
addressed upstream apparently.

So, use [CVE-2008-2085](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2085) for these new issues.
