Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2355

**Vulnerable Software:** WR-Meeting 1.0

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in the `index.php` file of WR-Meeting 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to include local files through the `msnum` parameter in the `index.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files (`config.php`) which could contain database credentials or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a manipulated `msnum` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of LFI:** The attacker needs to understand the concept of Local File Inclusion and how to exploit it by manipulating parameters in the URL.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit involves using the `msnum` parameter within the URL `index.php?event=coment&msnum=../config.php%00` to include the `config.php` file. The `%00` is used for null byte injection, which is a technique to bypass certain file inclusion checks.
