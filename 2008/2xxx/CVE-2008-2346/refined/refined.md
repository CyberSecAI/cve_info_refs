Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The `adduser.php` page in AlkalinePHP does not implement proper access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to add admin accounts. The developer likely assumed that since the page handles requests, it was safe from unauthorized access.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of authentication and authorization checks on the `adduser.php` page. This allows for arbitrary user creation with admin privileges.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can create a new administrator account, gaining full control over the application. Once an attacker has administrator access, they can view sensitive database connection information via `/editsettings.php` and potentially modify user data via `/edituser.php`.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `adduser.php` page with parameters to create a new admin user.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Information:**
* The exploit details the specific URL parameters that need to be modified to add an administrator.
* The exploit notes that the admin login is the same as the normal user login.
* The exploit identifies additional interesting files, `/editsettings.php` and `/edituser.php`
