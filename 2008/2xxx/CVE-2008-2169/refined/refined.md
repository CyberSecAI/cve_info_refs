  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "BGP implementations from multiple vendors do not properly handle specially crafted BGP UPDATE messages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of specially crafted BGP UPDATE messages"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial of service by injecting a crafted BGP UPDATE message, leading to dropped sessions and potential routing instability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Injection of specially crafted BGP UPDATE messages into an existing BGP session.",
       "Spoofing of TCP traffic to inject crafted messages into a BGP session."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to either have a valid, configured BGP session, or be capable of spoofing TCP traffic to inject the crafted packets. The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated."
