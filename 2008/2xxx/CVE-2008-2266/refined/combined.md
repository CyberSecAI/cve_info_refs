Looks like CAN-2004-2265 was reintroduced, have a look at:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=320541>

Same issue, rewritten code.

# UUDeview: Insecure temporary file creation — GLSA **200808-11**

A vulnerability in UUDeview may allow local attackers to conduct symlink
attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/uudeview** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.5.20-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.5.20-r1** |

| Package | **news-nntp/nzbget** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.4.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.4.0** |

### Background

UUdeview is encoder and decoder supporting various binary formats.
NZBGet is a command-line based binary newsgrabber supporting .nzb
files.

### Description

UUdeview makes insecure usage of the tempnam() function when creating
temporary files. NZBGet includes a copy of the vulnerable code.

### Impact

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overwrite
arbitrary files on the system.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All UUDview users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/uudeview-0.5.20-r1"
```

All NZBget users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=news-nntp/nzbget-0.4.0"
```

nzbget before 0.3.0 (I tried 0.2.3) ships a copy of the affected code.
Nico's patch applies there fine. As for false positives, Convert-UUlib
and pan fixed their copies of the code.

Package: libuu-dev
Version: 0.5.20-3
Severity: critical
Tags: security upstream

Security team: libuu-dev is a static-only library (see #216593).
klibido, nget and slrn build-depend on libuu-dev, while
libconvert-uulib-perl and kde (I don't know exactly which package,
look in the kdesupport directory) contain an embedded copy.

Pan has an embedded copy too, but it's modified and does not contain
this code.

This code in uulib/uunconc.c is vulnerable to symlink attacks.

  if ((data->binfile = tempnam (NULL, "uu")) == NULL) {
    UUMessage (uunconc_id, __LINE__, UUMSG_ERROR,
               uustring (S_NO_TEMP_NAME));
    return UURET_NOMEM;
  }

tags 480972 + patch
thanks

Hi,
I wrote a patch to fix this. I have no idea how to test this
specific functionality so it would be nice if someone could
do this before uploading it.

Patch attached.

Kind regards
Nico

I took a look at uulib/uunconc.c in libconvert-uulib-perl and I have
the impression that it's not vulnerable because it uses mkstemp
instead of tempnam if available.

This was also already mentioned in
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=320541#30>

Still I'd appreciate if someone who speaks better C than me could
take a look to verify.

Cheers,
gregor

Confirmed, the version of uunconc.c in libconvert-uulib-perl
is not vulnerable. Added this to the security tracker.
Thanks for checking!

Attached is an updated patch which ports the changes made in
libconvert-uulib-perl·to uudeview. Please use this patch
instead of the other one as the first one misses the second
tempnam call.

Kind regards
Nico

I tried locating it in kde (kdesupport directory). I could find it thru google
code search in a  ancient (probably kde 1) tarball on some openbsd mirrors.

But I couldn't find it in neither kde3 or kde4.

(I looked for the file mentioned ..)

Yes, same here. Looks like some deprecated package for kde
libs. I couldn't find that either in current source
packages. Marco, where did you get this information?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
