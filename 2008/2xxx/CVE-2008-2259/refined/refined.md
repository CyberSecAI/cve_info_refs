Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-2259:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer handles argument validation during print preview operations. Specifically, the application incorrectly handles validation of arguments, which can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Argument Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper argument validation in the print preview functionality of Internet Explorer. This flaw allows an attacker to manipulate arguments to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, gaining the same user rights as the currently logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control over the system.
- **System Compromise:** An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Web Page:** Attackers can exploit this by creating a malicious web page designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the malicious web page, typically through a link in an email, instant message, or via a compromised website hosting the exploit.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can also exploit vulnerable websites, or sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, to deliver specially crafted content capable of exploiting the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Web Hosting:** The attacker needs to host the malicious web page on a server that is accessible to the victim.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade the victim to visit the malicious page via links.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft the malicious web page to trigger the specific argument validation error in the print preview handling.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of print previews.
- The vulnerability is specific to Internet Explorer.
- Microsoft's advisory recommends immediate patching.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" for most affected systems.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description, which just mentions the vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer handles argument validation.
