Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2455

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `comment.php` file of the e107 Plugin BLOG Engine. Specifically, the `rid` parameter, taken directly from the URL's GET request, is used in a SQL query without sufficient validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. This means that the attacker cannot directly see the output of their SQL queries, but can infer results based on whether the application returns an error or not. By sending carefully crafted SQL statements and observing the application's response (error or no error), an attacker can extract sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Extraction:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
- **Database Manipulation:** Although blind, SQL injection can, in some cases, be used to manipulate data in the database (less common for blind SQLi but possible).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL with a modified `rid` parameter. This parameter is included in a GET request sent to the vulnerable `comment.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious injection payloads.
- **Understanding of Blind SQLi Techniques:** The attacker needs to use time based or boolean based techniques for exploiting blind sql injection, since the application will not reveal query results directly.
