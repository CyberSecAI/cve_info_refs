Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2175

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `comments.php` file of BlogMe PHP version 1.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the 'id' parameter in `comments.php`, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Exposure:** Attackers can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, database structure, or other confidential data.
- **Data Modification:** A successful exploit can also allow an attacker to modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specifically crafted HTTP GET request to the `comments.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand basic SQL syntax and be able to craft malicious SQL queries.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit examples provided demonstrate how to use a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the database.
  - One example shows how to extract the current database user.
  - Another shows how to extract the database name.
- The exploit utilizes the `id` parameter and sets it to -1 to ensure that no original results are returned, and only the injected query is executed.
