```
  - Root cause of vulnerability:
    The vulnerability stems from the way Java Web Start (JWS) handles system properties specified in JNLP files. Certain versions of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allow values supplied through JNLP files to override existing system defaults for properties like java.home, java.ext.dirs, and user.home.

  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Unsafe interpretation of properties specified in JNLP files.
    - System properties like java.home and java.ext.dirs can be overridden, allowing for potential redirection to malicious JRE or extension locations.
    - Unsigned JNLP files are hosted on third-party websites, while the JAR files must be signed by a trusted author.
  
  - Impact of exploitation:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the victim's system by loading malicious code through manipulated system properties.
    - Privilege escalation by utilizing a malicious java.home or java.ext.dirs values to point to a remote or local malicious JRE or extensions installation.
    - Potential for local file access, network connections, and session hijacking through malicious code injection.
  
  - Attack vectors:
    - A malicious actor hosts a specially crafted JNLP file on a web server.
    - A victim is lured into visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious JNLP file that references a trusted but vulnerable application.
    - The malicious JNLP file overrides critical system properties such as "java.home" to point to attacker controlled malicious JRE or extensions, instead of the local JRE.
  
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs to host a malicious JNLP file and malicious Java code/JRE/extensions on a server accessible to the victim.
    - The attacker needs to trick the victim to launch the malicious JNLP application.
    - The attacker could use a network share reachable by the victim for hosting the malicious components.
