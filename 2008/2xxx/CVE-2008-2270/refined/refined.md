```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion due to the lack of proper sanitization of the 'main_page_directory' and 'page_to_include' parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the application and server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'main_page_directory' and 'page_to_include' GET parameters in the URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker also needs to control a server hosting malicious code to be included."
