The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting several Xigla products. Specifically, CVE-2008-2768 is associated with a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in "search.asp" within Absolute Poll Manager XE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the "search.asp" file of the Absolute Poll Manager XE. User-supplied data is reflected in the web page without being properly encoded or validated.
*   **Weakness:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into the vulnerable web page. When a user visits this page, the malicious script will execute within their browser. This can be leveraged to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the web page, or perform other unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack is performed through crafted HTTP requests to the "search.asp" page. The attacker includes malicious JavaScript code within the parameters that are reflected in the page.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests with malicious code and have a victim user access a page that reflects the injected code.
*   **Affected Product:** Absolute Poll Manager XE (admin)
*   **Affected File:** `search.asp`
*   **Affected Parameter**: all fields
