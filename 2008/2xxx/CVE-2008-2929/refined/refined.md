Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2929:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of %-escaped inputs in multiple CGI scripts used by Red Hat/Fedora Directory Server.
*   The issue was located in the `adminutil` library, which contains common functionality used by multiple CGI scripts for parsing GET/POST arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper sanitization allows for XSS attacks. By injecting malicious scripts through crafted %-escaped inputs, attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to run arbitrary scripts in the browser of users who interact with the vulnerable web interfaces, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
*   **Compromised Admin Accounts:**  The vulnerability affects the Directory Server Administration Express web interface, potentially giving attackers access to administrative functions if an administrator is tricked into triggering the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious GET/POST Requests:** Attackers can craft malicious GET or POST requests to the vulnerable CGI scripts with specially crafted %-escaped input.
*   **Browser-Based:** The attack is executed through a user's web browser when they interact with the compromised or malicious CGI scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Directory Server web interfaces.
*   **Understanding of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker would need to know which parameters are vulnerable to the XSS vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**

* Red Hat Directory Server 7.1
* Red Hat Directory Server 8 (limited to Administration Express issues)
* Fedora Directory Server

**Additional Details:**
*   The issue affects both Administration Express scripts and Directory Server Gateway (DSGW) scripts. However, the DSGW component is not shipped with Red Hat Directory Server 8.
*   The fix involves updating the adminutil package to properly sanitize %-escaped user-provided values.
*   Red Hat provided updated packages via RHSA-2008:0596 (for Red Hat Directory Server 7.1) and RHSA-2008:0601 (for Red Hat Directory Server 8).
