Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2104:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from `bugzilla.mozilla.org` and `www.bugzilla.org` directly references the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-2104. It confirms that the issue involves unauthorized bug creation with specific statuses via the XML-RPC interface in Bugzilla.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an insufficient privilege check in the `Bugzilla::Bug->create()` function when processing requests via the XML-RPC interface. The code does not properly enforce that users without the "canconfirm" privilege cannot create bugs with the "NEW" or "ASSIGNED" status. The vulnerability was introduced by a change in how bug status updates were handled, specifically moving the logic from `process_bug.cgi` into `Bugzilla::Bug`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Privilege Check:** The primary weakness lies in the inadequate authorization control for bug creation via XML-RPC.  Users who should not have the ability to create bugs in the 'NEW' or 'ASSIGNED' state were able to bypass the normal access controls.
*   **XML-RPC Interface Bypass:** The vulnerability is specific to the XML-RPC interface, meaning the standard web interface likely enforced the privilege check correctly.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Bug Status Modification:** Attackers can create bugs in the `NEW` or `ASSIGNED` status without having the `canconfirm` privilege. This could potentially disrupt workflow, bypass normal review processes, and lead to confusion.
*   **Workflow Disruption:** Malicious users could create a large number of bugs in an attempt to disrupt bug tracking.
*   **Potential Information Security Impact:** Although the content doesn't explicitly mention a direct data breach,  the ability to manipulate bug status could be leveraged to conceal or obscure other potential malicious activity.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **XML-RPC Interface:** The attack vector is the XML-RPC interface of Bugzilla.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to XML-RPC Interface:** The attacker needs network access to the Bugzilla XML-RPC interface.
*   **Basic XML-RPC knowledge** The attacker must be able to craft a valid XML-RPC request
*   **No "canconfirm" privilege:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by *not* having the `canconfirm` privilege.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug was fixed as part of a larger fix in Bug 384009.
*   The vulnerability is specifically identified as a regression introduced in Bugzilla 3.1.3 due to the code change from bug 402791.
*   Bugzilla versions 3.1.3, 3.0.3, 2.22.3, and 2.20.5 were affected.
*   The resolution for the vulnerability is to upgrade to a version where the relevant fix was included.

The `vupen.com` and `secunia.com` content are not useful for this CVE.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthorized bug creation with NEW/ASSIGNED status via XML-RPC.
*   **Root Cause:** Inadequate privilege check in `Bugzilla::Bug->create()` via the XML-RPC interface.
*   **Impact:** Workflow disruption, potential information security impact.
*   **Attack Vector:** Bugzilla's XML-RPC interface.
*   **Attacker Position:** Requires network access to XML-RPC interface, and lack of "canconfirm" privilege.
