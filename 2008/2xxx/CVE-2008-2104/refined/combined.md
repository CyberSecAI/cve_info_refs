Bug->create() doesn't make sure that the bug status entered by the user is legal based on his privs. If votes to confirm > 0, then a user with no privs cannot choose the initial bug status; this one must be UNCONFIRMED. Either \_check\_bug\_status() or create() itself should enforce this, maybe using something like:
delete $params->{bug\_status} unless $user->in\_group('canconfirm', $product)Flags: blocking3.2+

Have you actually tried this? \_check\_bug\_status has code to explicitly prevent that--it always picks the default status if you're not in canconfirm or editbugs.Group: webtools-security

Of course I did, else I would have never noticed it. I have a plenty of bugs filed as ASSIGNED from powerless users. Note that the security flag is not needed here as we never mark bugs affecting development only as such.

We do, and we have, particularly if it affects a released development version.

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Users without the "canconfirm" privilege could enter a bug as NEW
  or ASSIGNED by using the XML-RPC interface.

* When viewing several bugs at once, there was a Cross-Site Scripting hole.

* The inbound email interface allowed you to set the Reporter via the
  text of the email, instead of just using the From header.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Unauthorized Bug Change
Affected:    3.1.3
Description: Users normally need the "canconfirm" privilege to put bugs
             in the NEW or ASSIGNED state. However, users were being
             allowed to create bugs in the NEW or ASSIGNED state if they
             were creating the bug through the XML-RPC interface.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=415471

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.17.2 and higher
Description: When using the "Format for Printing" view of a bug (or
             the "Long Format" of a bug list, which is the same thing),
             there was a cross-site scripting hole--arbitrary text
             from a particular URL parameter could be injected into the
             page without filtering.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=425665

Class:       Account Impersonation (Minor)
Affected:    2.23.4 and higher
Description: By design, email_in.pl always believes the "From" header as
             the user making changes or uses that as the reporter of the
             bug. However, you could also specify the changer/reporter in
             the body of the email and override the "From" header, possibly
             bypassing some security checks set up by administrators
             against the "From" header.
             For most installations this is a minor or inconsequential
             issue, as the documentation of email_in.pl already explains
             that it does not do any user authentication (it just
             believes the "From" header), so installations using it should
             not have been expecting user account security (though they
             may have had checks against the "From" header--that is what
             makes this a security issue).

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fix for these issues is included in the
releases. Upgrading to a release with the relevant fix will
protect your installation from possible exploits of these issues.

If you are unable to upgrade but would like to patch just the security
vulnerability, there are patches available for the issues at the
"References" URL.

Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous
versions, and git upgrade instructions are available at:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
