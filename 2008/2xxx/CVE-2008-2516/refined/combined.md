How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: libpam-pgsql: <Ctrl+C> while in authentication phase induces success,
may circumvent sudo et al.

[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=481970;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: libpam-pgsql
Version: 0.6.3-1
Severity: critical
Tags: security
Justification: root security hole

I recently upgraded libpam-pgsql to 0.6.3-1.  I now noticed that
pressing <Ctrl+C> during libpam-pgsql's authentication phase, e.g., when
sudo is asking for the user's password, erroneously causes sudo to
succeed as if the user had entered the correct password, IF pam_pgsql.so
has been configured as a "sufficient" authentication module in the
system's PAM setup.

I am attaching my /etc/pam.d/common-auth and /etc/pam.d/sudo files for
illustration.  Only the former has been changed from the PAM defaults.

Here's a transcript demonstrating the effect:

| io:~> id
| uid=1004(julian) gid=100(users) groups=0(root),4(adm),8(mail),32(postgres),40(src),50(staff),100(users),[...]
| io:~> sudo -k
| io:~> sudo id
| [sudo] password for julian: ^C
| uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),4(adm)

Even though pam_pgsql.so is not configured as a "sufficient" auth module
by default, I consider this a critical security issue in the libpam-
pgsql package.  Feel free to downgrade the severity if you think
otherwise.

Description:
 libpam-pgsql - PAM module to authenticate using a PostgreSQL database
Closes: [481970](bugreport.cgi?bug=481970)
Changes:
 pam-pgsql (0.6.3-2) unstable; urgency=high
 .
   * High-urgency QA upload to get security fix into testing.
   * Fix upstream security issue that granted root access when pressing Ctrl-C
     in sudo’s authentication conversation, closes: #[481970](bugreport.cgi?bug=481970).  The problem was
     caused by a mistake in operator precedence leading to a pam_get_pass call
     always being considered successful; it is fixed by adding a level of
     parentheses.
