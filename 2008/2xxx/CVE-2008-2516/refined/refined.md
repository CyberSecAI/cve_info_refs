[CVE-2008-2516]

- Vulnerability: Pressing Ctrl+C during libpam-pgsql's authentication phase causes sudo to succeed, granting root access.
- Root Cause: A mistake in operator precedence in pam_get_pass call leads to it always being considered successful.
- Impact: Circumvention of authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized root access.
- Attack Vector: Pressing Ctrl+C during the password prompt in authentication processes like sudo.
- Required Capabilities: User-level access with the ability to initiate an authentication process using sudo or similar tools configured to use libpam-pgsql. The attacker needs to press Ctrl+C during the password prompt.
