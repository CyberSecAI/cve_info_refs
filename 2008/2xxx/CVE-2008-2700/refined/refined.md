  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `view.php` script. Specifically, the `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL injection vulnerability in `view.php` script due to lack of input sanitization of the `id` parameter."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, specifically usernames and password hashes.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to `view.php` with a malicious `id` parameter containing SQL injection payloads.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required for exploitation."
