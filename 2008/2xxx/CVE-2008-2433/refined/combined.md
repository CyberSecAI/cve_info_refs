server-edition/
======================================================================
4) Description of Vulnerability
Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in certain Trend Micro
products, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass
authentication.
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient entropy being used to
create a random session token for identifying an authenticated
manager using the web management console. The entropy in the session
token comes solely from the system time when the real manager logs in
with a granularity of one second. This can be exploited to
impersonate a currently logged on manager by brute forcing the
authentication token.
Successful exploitation further allows execution of arbitrary code
via manipulation of the configuration.
======================================================================
5) Solution
The vendor has issued patches for Trend Micro OfficeScan 8.0 and
Worry-Free Business Security 5.0.
Fixes for other affected versions should be available shortly.
======================================================================
