Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability present in the `Netbutikker` application. This vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This allows an attacker to manipulate the application's database queries by injecting malicious SQL code through user-controlled parameters such as `cat` and `id`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information such as usernames and passwords from the database (`netbutikX_brugere` tables).
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can potentially modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the SQL injection, the attacker might be able to escalate their privileges within the application or gain access to other parts of the database not intended for public use.
*   **Code Execution:** While not explicitly detailed, the note about uploading "Ev!l code" suggests a secondary vulnerability, possibly related to insecure file uploads which an attacker could leverage to upload malicious PHP files via the admin panel, which could result in Remote Code Execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to `netbutik.php` and `product.php` where parameters like `cat` and `id` are vulnerable.
*   **Manipulated Query Parameters:** The attacker manipulates these parameters with SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** A basic knowledge of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques is required to craft the malicious payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required (for SQL injection):** The exploit examples suggest that the SQL injection can be triggered without authentication.
*   **Access to Admin Panel (for file upload):** To exploit the file upload vulnerability, the attacker would need some sort of access to the administration panel (`/admin/admin_edit_products.php`).

**Additional Information:**

*   **Vulnerable Application:** `Netbutik` versions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are vulnerable.
*   **Exploit Examples:** The provided exploit examples show how to inject SQL code into the `cat` and `id` parameters in the `netbutik.php` and `product.php` files respectively to extract user credentials from the database.
*   **Admin Panel Vulnerability**: The content also mentions that it's possible to upload malicious files through the admin panel (`admin_edit_products.php`). This implies a lack of sanitization or validation checks on file uploads.
