  "cve": "CVE-2008-2189",
  "description": "The 'cat' parameter in Anserv Auction XL's viewfaqs.php is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly verify input before using it in a SQL query.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input passed through the 'cat' parameter in the 'viewfaqs.php' script before using it in an SQL query.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain system access by retrieving sensitive information such as usernames and password hashes from the database. Specifically, it allows reading data from the 'PHPAUCTIONXL_adminusers' table.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to 'viewfaqs.php' with a malicious SQL payload in the 'cat' parameter."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be remote and doesn't need any specific authentication to perform the attack. The attacker needs to craft a malicious SQL query that can be injected through the vulnerable parameter."
  },
    "additional_details": {
    "magic_quotes_requirement": "Successful exploitation requires that the PHP 'magic_quotes' setting is disabled.",
    "poc_exploit": "A proof of concept exploit is provided:\n`http://www.target.com/viewfaqs.php?cat=-1%20union%20select%20concat(id,0x3a,username,0x3a,password)%20from%20PHPAUCTIONXL_adminusers--`"
