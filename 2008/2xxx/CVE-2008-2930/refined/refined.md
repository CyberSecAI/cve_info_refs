      "content": "It was discovered that Red Hat Directory Server and Fedora Directory Server is prone to a temporary denial of service attack (high CPU usage) via crafted LDAP search patterns.\n\nLDAP search patterns are internally translated to regular expressions. If the regular expression is matched against specially crafted record already stored in the LDAP, it may cause regular expression NFA to iterate over large amount of states, causing one slapd thread to occupy CPU for excessive amount of time.\n\nAdditionally, due to a current design of the regular expression handling code, only one slapd thread can execute regular expression NFA code at the time. Because of that, during the processing of such CPU intensive search request, all other search requests using patterns are blocked.\n\nAffected version: Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 and 8\nFedora Directory Server 1.1.1",
      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the way Red Hat Directory Server and Fedora Directory Server handle LDAP search patterns. These patterns are internally translated into regular expressions. When a regular expression, crafted maliciously and matched against specific records in LDAP, it causes the regular expression NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton) to iterate through a large number of states, leading to excessive CPU usage by a single `slapd` thread.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Inefficient regular expression processing leading to high CPU usage",
          "Single-threaded execution of regular expression NFA code"
        ],
        "impact": "A temporary denial-of-service (DoS). Processing a crafted LDAP search pattern leads to high CPU usage of a single `slapd` thread, blocking other search requests using patterns. This can render the directory server temporarily unresponsive.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "Crafting malicious LDAP search patterns that, when translated to regular expressions, cause a high number of iterations during matching."
          ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can trigger the issue by either sending crafted search requests. Anonymous users can exploit the vulnerability if a matching record exists in the LDAP. Authenticated users with write access can inject such matching records into the directory."
