How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Fetchmail

# NEWS: FETCHMAIL 6.5.2 release

On 2024-12-30, [fetchmail
6.5.2 has been released (click this link to download, or to see recent changes).](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/files/branch_6.5/)

This is a third fetchmail 6.5 release and updates translations and polishes some minor oversights in documentation status, date, version numbers.

Fetchmail 6.5.1 on 2024-11-12 was the second fetchmail 6.5 release and polished a few areas to improve the buildability, added a few strings to the translations that were missed in 6.5.0, and also added warnings about deprecating crypto material that is based on MD4, MD5, or SHA1.

Fetchmail 6.5.0 on 2024-10-29 was the first fetchmail 6.5 release and shipped with ten message translations besides English.
While maintaining good compatibility with single-unix-specification v3+ and newer compliant systems,
it now requires a C99 compilation environment.
Fetchmail supports being built by meson 1.3.0 or newer, and mentions that POP3 LAST errors aren't a bug. It can also be built with wolfSSL 5.7.2 or newer. OpenSSL versions before 3.0.9 are no longer supported. The release tarball was built with autotools though, but either build toolset (autoconf/automake or meson) should yield a reasonable install.

As of 2024-09-24, fetchmail 6.4 and older releases are no longer supported. Use fetchmail 6.5.

# NEWS: SOURCE**FORGE** Open Source Excellence award received

On 2024-05-14, SOURCE**FORGE** has recognized fetchmail with the Open Source Excellence award for reaching 100,000 downloads from their site. The [SOURCE**FORGE** project page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/) now displays a relevant badge.

Note that this neither counts downloads from the prior BerliOS hosting, personal homepages of the maintainer, nor installations via redistributions, mirror sites, binary packages.

# SECURITY ALERTS

These have been moved [to a separate
page (click here for security information)](security.html) to unclutter the
front page.

**Please [update
to the newest fetchmail version](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/files/branch_6.5/).**

# What fetchmail does:

Fetchmail is a full-featured, robust, well-documented
remote-mail retrieval and forwarding utility intended to be used over
on-demand TCP/IP links (such as SLIP or PPP connections). It supports
every remote-mail protocol now in use on the Internet: POP2, POP3,
RPOP, APOP, KPOP, all flavors of IMAP, ETRN, and ODMR. It can even
support IPv6 and IPSEC.

Fetchmail retrieves mail from remote mail servers and forwards it via
SMTP, so it can then be read by normal mail user agents such as [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/), elm(1) or BSD Mail.
It allows all your system MTA's filtering, forwarding, and aliasing
facilities to work just as they would on normal mail.

Fetchmail offers better protection against password-sniffing than any
other Unix remote-mail client. It supports APOP, KPOP, OTP, Compuserve
RPA, Microsoft NTLM, and IMAP RFC1731 encrypted authentication methods
including CRAM-MD5 to avoid sending passwords en clair. It can be
configured to support end-to-end encryption via tunneling with [ssh, the Secure Shell](https://www.openssh.com/).

Fetchmail can be used as a POP/IMAP-to-SMTP gateway for an entire DNS
domain, collecting mail from a single drop box on an ISP and
SMTP-forwarding it based on header addresses. (We don't really
recommend this, though, as it may lose important envelope-header
information. ETRN or a UUCP connection is better.)

Fetchmail can be started automatically and silently as a system daemon
at boot time. When running in this mode with a short poll interval,
it is pretty hard for anyone to tell that the incoming mail link is
not a full-time "push" connection.

Fetchmail is easy to configure. You can edit its dotfile directly, or
use the interactive GUI configurator (fetchmailconf) supplied with the
fetchmail distribution. It is also directly supported in linuxconf
versions 1.16r8 and later.

Fetchmail is [open-source](https://opensource.org)
and [free
software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

# Where to find out more about fetchmail:

See the [Fetchmail Feature List](fetchmail-features.html) for more
about what fetchmail does.

See the on-line [manual page](fetchmail-man.html) for
basics.

See the [HTML Fetchmail FAQ](fetchmail-FAQ.html) for
troubleshooting help.

See the [Fetchmail Design Notes](design-notes.html)
for discussion of some of the design choices in fetchmail.

See the project's [To-Do list](todo.html) for indications
of known problems and requested features.

The developers use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for revision
control. To browse the repository or to get the latest development version,

page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/) for more, including [downloads](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/files/branch_6.5/).

# Getting help with fetchmail:

Before submitting a question anywhere, **please read the [FAQ](fetchmail-FAQ.html)** (especially item [G3](fetchmail-FAQ.html#G3) on how to report problems). We tend to get
the same three newbie questions over and over again. The FAQ covers them like
a blanket.

There is a fetchmail-users list for help and other user discussion
of fetchmail. It's a MailMan list, which you can sign up for at [fetchmail-users@lists.sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/lists/fetchmail-users).

There is also a
fetchmail-devel list for people who want to discuss fixes and
improvements in fetchmail and help co-develop it. That one is at [fetchmail-devel@lists.sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/lists/fetchmail-devel).

Finally, there is a low-traffic announcements-only list, [fetchmail-announce@lists.sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/lists/fetchmail-announce).

# Maintainer History

Fetchmail originated as a program called *popclient*, written
by Carl Harris. In 1996, [Eric
S. Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/) took over; he soon renamed the program to fetchmail after
adding IMAP support.

In 2004 a new team took over, led by [Rob Funk](https://sourceforge.net/u/robfunk/profile/),
Graham Wilson, and [Matthias Andree](https://sourceforge.net/u/m-a/profile/). Since then,
Graham Wilson has retreated, and Sunil Shetye has
contributed several important pieces of code.

# You can help improve fetchmail:

We welcome your code contributions. But even if you don't write code,
you can help fetchmail improve.

**If you administer a site that runs a post-office server, you may be
able help improve fetchmail by lending us a test account on your site.
Note that we do not need a shell account for this purpose, just a
mailbox and a mail address. Nor are we interested in collecting maildrops per
se -- what we're collecting is different *kinds of servers*.**

Before each release, we run a test harness that sends date-stamped
test mail to each site on our regression-test list, then tries to
retrieve it. Please take a look at the [list of test servers](testservers.html). If you can lend us an account on a kind
of server that is *not* already on this list, please do.

# Where you can use fetchmail:

The fetchmail code was developed under Linux, but has also been
extensively tested under 4.4BSD, SunOS, Solaris, AIX, and NEXTSTEP. It
should be readily portable to other Unix variants (it requires only
POSIX plus BSD sockets, and uses GNU autoconf).

Fetchmail is supported only for Unix by its official maintainers.
However, it is reported to build and run correctly under BeOS,
AmigaOS, Rhapsody, and QNX as well. There is a CygWin port.

instance when it comes to SSL, but it's close enough to give us a bit of
competition.

There is also an [inofficial unsanctioned
fork called getmail6](https://getmail6.org/) with adaptations to work with Python 3.

**animail:** Another contender with integrated filtering was, but is currently unmaintained, [Juanjo Álvarez Martínez's Animail](https://github.com/juanjux/animail).

## Complementary and extension software

[GetLive](https://sourceforge.net/projects/getlive/), a successor to
the discontinued Gotmail. (Gotmail was a script to fetch mail from Hotmail,
written by Peter Hawkins, which used to live at the now defunct
http://linux.cudeso.be/linuxdoc/gotmail.php)

There's a program called
[mailfilter](http://mailfilter.sourceforge.net/) which can be used
to do spam filtering, that works particularly well called from fetchmail's
`preconnect` directive.

Subject: CVE Id Request: fetchmail <= 6.3.8 DoS when logging long headers
 in -v -v mode

Hi,

could I get a CVE Id for the issue given below?

Also, when someone sees a way to inject code through this vulnerability,
please let me know.

Given the report is sort-of-public in Novell's Bugzilla, a similar fix is
already public in the developer.BerliOS.de bugtracker, I don't see any
point in keeping this confidential, so I'm including the draft security
announcement below for my convenience.

Summary: fetchmail crashes (SIGSEGV while reading) in -v -v mode when
trying to format log messages exceeding 2048 bytes.

Reference: <<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=354291>>

Draft announcement:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
fetchmail-SA-2008-01: Crash on large log messages in verbose mode

Topics:         Crash in large log messages in verbose mode.

Author:         Matthias Andree
Version:        1.0
Announced:
Type:           Dereferencing garbage pointer trigged by outside circumstances
Impact:         denial of service possible
Danger:         low
CVSS V2 vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)

Credits:        Petr Uzel (fix), Petr Cerny (analysis), Gunter Nau (bug report)
CVE Name:       XXX
URL:            <http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-SA-2008-01.txt>
Project URL:    <http://www.fetchmail.info/>

Affects:        fetchmail release < 6.3.9 exclusively

Not affected:   fetchmail release 6.3.9 and newer
                systems without varargs (stdargs.h) support.

Corrected:      2008-06-13 fetchmail SVN (rev XXX)

0. Release history
==================

2008-06-13 1.0  first draft for MITRE/CVE (visible in SVN)

1. Background
=============

fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP2, POP3,
IMAP, ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents.

fetchmail ships with a graphical, Python/Tkinter based configuration
utility named "fetchmailconf" to help the user create configuration (run
control) files for fetchmail.

2. Problem description and Impact
=================================

Gunter Nau reported fetchmail crashing on some messages; further
debugging by Petr Uzel and Petr Cerny at Novell/SUSE Czech Republic
dug up that this happened when fetchmail was trying to print, in -v -v
verbose level, headers exceeding 2048 bytes. In this situation,
fetchmail would resize the buffer and fill in further parts of the
message, but forget to reinitialize its va_list typed source pointer,
thus reading data from a garbage address found on the stack at
addresses above the function arguments the caller passed in; usually
that would be the caller's stack frame.

It is unknown whether code can be injected remotely, but given that
the segmentation fault is caused by read accesses, the relevant data
is not under the remote attacker's control and no buffer overrun
situation is present that would allow altering program /flow/, it is
deemed rather unlikely that code can be injected.

Note that the required -vv configuration at hand is both non-default
and also not common in automated (cron job) setups, but usually used
in manual debugging, so not many systems would be affected by the
problem. Nonetheless, in vulnerable configurations, it is remotely
exploitable to effect a denial of service attack.

3. Solution
===========

There are two alternatives, either of them by itself is sufficient:

a. Apply the patch found in section B of this announcement to
   fetchmail 6.3.8, recompile and reinstall it.

b. Install fetchmail 6.3.9 or newer when it becomes available.  The
   fetchmail source code is available from
   <<http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824>>.

4. Workaround
=============

Run fetchmail at low verbosity, avoid using two or three -v arguments;
internal messages are short and do not contain external message
sources so they do not cause buffer resizing. It is recommended to
replace the vulnerable code by a fixed version (see previous
section 3. Solution) as soon as reasonably possible.

Subject: fetchmail 6.4.21 released/regression fix for 6.4.20's security fix,
 and UPDATE: fetchmail <= 6.4.19 security announcement 2021-01
 (CVE-2021-36386)

UPDATE:

While fetchmail 6.4.20 fixed CVE-2021-36386, it
introduced a bug WRT buffered logging that got fixed in 6.4.21.

Packagers should either upgrade all the way to 6.4.21, or pick the
near-trivial regression fix from section #3 below or Git commit d3db2da1
can be cherry-picked from the GitLab or SourceForge repos.

fetchmail 6.4.21 is available from
<<https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/files/branch_6.4/>>.

The source archive is available at:
<<https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/files/branch_6.4/fetchmail-6.4.21.tar.xz/download>>
<<https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/files/branch_6.4/fetchmail-6.4.21.tar.lz/download>>

Detached GnuPG signatures for the respective tarballs are at:
<<https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/files/branch_6.4/fetchmail-6.4.21.tar.xz.asc/download>>
<<https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/files/branch_6.4/fetchmail-6.4.21.tar.lz.asc/download>>

SHA256 hash values for the tarballs:
SHA256(fetchmail-6.4.21.tar.lz)= 3abbe5f7bb003bdf3b8b71a2edd896fba55cbd3d19d59fe2ff8925fca4983af7

Release notes follow:
---------------------

fetchmail-6.4.21 (released 2021-08-09, 30042 LoC):

# REGRESSION FIX:
* The new security fix in 6.4.20 for CVE-2021-36386 caused truncation of
  messages logged to buffered outputs, predominantly --logfile.

  This also caused lines in the logfile to run into one another because
  the fragment containing the '\n' line-end character was usually lost.

  Reason is that on all modern systems (with <stdarg.h> header and vsnprintf()
  interface), the length of log message fragments was added up twice, so
  that these ended too deep into a freshly allocated buffer, after the '\0'
  byte.  Unbuffered outputs flushed the fragments right away, which masked the
  bug.

  Reported by: Jürgen Edner, Erik Christiansen.

Updated security announcement follows:

1. Background
=============

fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP3, IMAP,
ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents. fetchmail supports SSL and TLS security layers

enabled at run time, in both SSL/TLS-wrapped mode on dedicated ports as
well as in-band-negotiated "STARTTLS" and "STLS" modes through the
regular protocol ports.

2. Problem description and Impact
=================================

Fetchmail has long had support to assemble log/error messages that are
generated piecemeal, and takes care to reallocate the output buffer as needed.
In the reallocation case, i. e. when long log messages are assembled that can
stem from very long headers, and on systems that have a varargs.h/stdarg.h
interface (all modern systems), fetchmail's code would fail to reinitialize
the va_list argument to vsnprintf.

The exact effects depend on the verbose mode (how many -v are given) of
fetchmail, computer architecture, compiler, operating system and
configuration.  On some systems, the code just works without ill effects, some
systems log a garbage message (potentially disclosing sensitive information),
some systems log literally "(null)", some systems trigger SIGSEGV (signal
#11), which crashes fetchmail, causing a denial of service on fetchmail's end.

The same bug then named CVE-2008-2711 had already been fixed in fetchmail 6.3.9,
but a code refactoring in fetchmail 6.3.17 (commit 414a3809 in 2010)
reintroduced the bug.
Fetchmail versions 6.4.19 and older are no longer supported, however.

The bugfix used in 6.4.20 uses a different, more thorough, approach.

3. Solution
===========

Install fetchmail 6.4.21 or newer.

The fetchmail source code is available from
<<https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/files/>>.

Distributors are encouraged to review the NEWS file and move forward to
6.4.21, rather than backport individual security fixes, because doing so
routinely misses other fixes crucial to fetchmail's proper operation,
for which no security announcements are issued, or documentation,
or translation updates.

The regression fix for the new non-security bug in 6.4.20 that causes
log message truncation simply consists of editing report.c to rotate lines 289
through 291, such that the /corrected/ report.c then looks like this:

   286	    n = snprintf (partial_message + partial_message_size_used,
   287			    partial_message_size - partial_message_size_used,
   288			    message, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8);
   289
   290	    if (n > 0) partial_message_size_used += n;
   291	#endif
   292
   293	    if (unbuffered && partial_message_size_used != 0)

Fetchmail 6.4.X releases have been made with a focus on unchanged user and
program interfaces so as to avoid disruptions when upgrading from 6.3.Z or
6.4.X to 6.4.Y with Y > X.  Care was taken to not change the interface
incompatibly.

0. Release history
==================
2008-06-13 1.0 first draft for MITRE/CVE (visible in SVN,
posted to oss-security)
2008-06-17 1.0 published on http://www.fetchmail.info/
2008-06-17 1.1 Corrected typo in Type: above (trigged -> triggered)
2008-06-24 1.2 also fixed issue in report\_complete (reported by Petr Uzel)
2014-05-21 1.3 drop obsolete BerliOS link from References: in header above
1. Background
=============
fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP2, POP3,
IMAP, ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents.
fetchmail ships with a graphical, Python/Tkinter based configuration
utility named "fetchmailconf" to help the user create configuration (run
control) files for fetchmail.
2. Problem description and Impact
=================================
Gunter Nau reported fetchmail crashing on some messages; further
debugging by Petr Uzel and Petr Cerny at Novell/SUSE Czech Republic
dug up that this happened when fetchmail was trying to print, in -v -v
verbose level, headers exceeding 2048 bytes. In this situation,
fetchmail would resize the buffer and fill in further parts of the
message, but forget to reinitialize its va\_list typed source pointer,
thus reading data from a garbage address found on the stack at
addresses above the function arguments the caller passed in; usually
that would be the caller's stack frame.
It is unknown whether code can be injected remotely, but given that
the segmentation fault is caused by read accesses, the relevant data
is not under the remote attacker's control and no buffer overrun
situation is present that would allow altering program /flow/, it is
deemed rather unlikely that code can be injected.
Note that the required -vv configuration at hand is both non-default
and also not common in automated (cron job) setups, but usually used
in manual debugging, so not many systems would be affected by the
problem. Nonetheless, in vulnerable configurations, it is remotely
exploitable to effect a denial of service attack.
3. Solution
===========
There are two alternatives, either of them by itself is sufficient:
a. Apply the patch found in section B of this announcement to
fetchmail 6.3.8, recompile and reinstall it.
b. Install fetchmail 6.3.9 or newer after it will have become available.
The fetchmail source code is always available from
.
4. Workaround
=============
Run fetchmail at low verbosity, avoid using two or three -v arguments;
internal messages are short and do not contain external message
sources so they do not cause buffer resizing. It is recommended to
replace the vulnerable code by a fixed version (see previous
section 3. Solution) as soon as reasonably possible.

1. Background
=============
fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP3, IMAP,
ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents. fetchmail supports SSL and TLS security layers
through the OpenSSL library, if enabled at compile time and if also
enabled at run time, in both SSL/TLS-wrapped mode on dedicated ports as
well as in-band-negotiated "STARTTLS" and "STLS" modes through the
regular protocol ports.
2. Problem description and Impact
=================================
Fetchmail has long had support to assemble log/error messages that are
generated piecemeal, and takes care to reallocate the output buffer as needed.
In the reallocation case, i. e. when long log messages are assembled that can
stem from very long headers, and on systems that have a varargs.h/stdarg.h
interface (all modern systems), fetchmail's code would fail to reinitialize
the va\_list argument to vsnprintf.
The exact effects depend on the verbose mode (how many -v are given) of
fetchmail, computer architecture, compiler, operating system and
configuration. On some systems, the code just works without ill effects, some
systems log a garbage message (potentially disclosing sensitive information),
some systems log literally "(null)", some systems trigger SIGSEGV (signal
#11), which crashes fetchmail, causing a denial of service on fetchmail's end.
The same bug then named CVE-2008-2711 had already been fixed in fetchmail 6.3.9,
but a code refactoring in fetchmail 6.3.17 (commit 414a3809 in 2010)
reintroduced the bug.
Fetchmail versions 6.4.19 and older are no longer supported, however.
The bugfix used in 6.4.20 uses a different, more thorough, approach.
3. Solution
===========
Install fetchmail 6.4.21 or newer.
The fetchmail source code is available from
.
Distributors are encouraged to review the NEWS file and move forward to
6.4.21, rather than backport individual security fixes, because doing so
routinely misses other fixes crucial to fetchmail's proper operation,
for which no security announcements are issued, or documentation,
or translation updates.
The regression fix for the new non-security bug in 6.4.20 that causes
log message truncation simply consists of editing report.c to rotate lines 289
through 291, such that the /corrected/ report.c then looks like this:
286 n = snprintf (partial\_message + partial\_message\_size\_used,
287 partial\_message\_size - partial\_message\_size\_used,
288 message, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8);
289
290 if (n > 0) partial\_message\_size\_used += n;
291 #endif
292
293 if (unbuffered && partial\_message\_size\_used != 0)
Fetchmail 6.4.X releases have been made with a focus on unchanged user and
program interfaces so as to avoid disruptions when upgrading from 6.3.Z or
6.4.X to 6.4.Y with Y > X. Care was taken to not change the interface
incompatibly.
