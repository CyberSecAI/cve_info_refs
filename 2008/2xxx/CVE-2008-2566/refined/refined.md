    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-2566",
      "description": "PHP-Address Book <= 3.1.5 is vulnerable to SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
      "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `view.php` and `edit.php` files, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Also, unsanitized input in the `group` parameter allows for XSS.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "SQL Injection",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries to potentially extract sensitive information from the database. An attacker can also inject malicious JavaScript code that could be executed in the victim's browser.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET requests to `view.php` and `edit.php` with a crafted `id` parameter for SQL Injection.",
        "HTTP GET requests to `index.php` or the root directory with a crafted `group` parameter for XSS."
      ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the target web server. No authentication is required to exploit these vulnerabilities."
