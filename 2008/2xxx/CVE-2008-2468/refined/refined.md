CVE-2008-2468
```
The provided content relates to CVE-2008-2468.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the LANDesk Intel QIP service (Qipsrvr.exe).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The Intel QIP service (Qipsrvr.exe) is susceptible to a buffer overflow, due to insufficient bounds checking when processing certain requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute code with system privileges on a vulnerable machine.

**Attack vectors:**
A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the Intel QIP service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable service which listens on TCP port 12175 by default. No authentication is required.
