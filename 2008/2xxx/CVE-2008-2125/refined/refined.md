```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `artistId` parameter in the `viewalbums.php` file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
- Attack vectors: A remote attacker can manipulate the `artistId` parameter in the URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
