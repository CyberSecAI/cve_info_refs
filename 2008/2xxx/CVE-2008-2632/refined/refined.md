```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `com_acctexp` component of Joomla! is vulnerable to blind SQL injection through the `usage` parameter.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Blind SQL Injection vulnerability
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can extract sensitive information such as user passwords from the database by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability
- Attack vectors:  By sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable component, specifically manipulating the `usage` parameter in the `subscribe` task.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target Joomla! instance.
