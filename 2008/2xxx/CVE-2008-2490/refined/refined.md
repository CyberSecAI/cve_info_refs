Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2490

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly filter user input in the "KJ: Image Lightbox v2" (kj\_imagelightbox2) TYPO3 extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the extension does not sanitize or validate user-supplied data, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session when viewing a page using the vulnerable extension. This could potentially allow attackers to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface pages, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is not sanitized by the extension. This can potentially be in the image title, description, or any other input field that the extension uses directly in the HTML output.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious javascript into an input field used by the vulnerable TYPO3 extension and the user has to view this page. This could potentially be achieved if the attacker is able to add such input or to somehow alter existing content to inject the malicious javascript.

**Additional Information:**
*   The affected component is a third-party extension for TYPO3 CMS, not part of the core system.
*   The vulnerability affects versions 1.4.2 and below of the "KJ: Image Lightbox v2" extension and potentially all versions of its predecessor "kj\_imagelightbox".
*   A fix is available in version 1.4.3 of the extension.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Michael Raberger.
