- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection. The vulnerability is located in the `projects.php` page, specifically in the `id` parameter.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Blind SQL injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as admin usernames and passwords. In this specific exploit, the attacker retrieves the administrator password.
- Attack vectors: The attack is performed over HTTP, by manipulating the `id` parameter of the `projects.php` page.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
