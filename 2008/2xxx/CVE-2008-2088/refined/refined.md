Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the 'id' parameter of the `admin.php` script within the PHP Forge 3 Beta 2 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the 'id' parameter is directly used in a SQL query without sanitization, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can use this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. The provided exploit demonstrates the ability to select and reveal data from the `membres` table, including usernames, passwords, email addresses, and other user details.
- **Database Manipulation:** While not explicitly shown, the injection vulnerability could potentially be used to modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `admin.php` script.
- **Manipulated URL Parameter:** The 'id' parameter in the URL is manipulated with a malicious SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic SQL knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL syntax to craft injection queries.
- **No authentication required:** It appears that no authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability in the vulnerable part of the application.
