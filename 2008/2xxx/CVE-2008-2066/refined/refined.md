Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2008-2066:

**CVE-2008-2066:**

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in miniBB version 3.0.0 and possibly earlier versions. This allows for both Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `bb_admin.php` script. Specifically, the following GET parameters are vulnerable to XSS:
    *   `forum_name`
    *   `forum_group`
    *   `forum_icon`
    *   `whatus`
    *   `forum_desc`
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in `bb_admin.php` via the `searchus` and `whatus` parameters when the `action` parameter is set to `searchusers2`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which could lead to:
    *   Stealing user session cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
*  **SQL Injection:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data theft
    *   Data modification/deletion
    *   Privilege escalation
    *   Complete compromise of the database server

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** Attacker crafts a malicious URL containing Javascript code in the vulnerable GET parameters. The victim would need to access this URL, and the script would execute in their browser.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with SQL code injected into the `whatus` parameter which is then used in a SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For XSS, the attacker needs to entice a user to visit a malicious URL.
*   For SQL injection, no special capabilities are needed. The attacker only needs to craft the malicious URL and send it to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit these vulnerabilities, as they are present in the admin panel which should not be publicly accessible, but may be because of default settings.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Netsparker (now Invicti) during a scan and are confirmed to be present in miniBB version 3.0.0 and potentially earlier versions.
*   A fix was released in miniBB version 3.0.1, which indicates that this version is not affected.
*   The `htmlspecialchars` function was replaced with a custom function called `operate_string` in miniBB 3.0.1 to address encoding issues arising from usage with PHP 5.4.x. This replacement was implemented in the core and all add-ons as well, indicating the widespread use of the vulnerable `htmlspecialchars` in the prior version.

The provided content gives more detail than a standard CVE description by:

*   Providing specific vulnerable parameters and example URLs.
*   Describing the context within which the `htmlspecialchars` function was used and how it failed.
*   Including the timeline for discovery, patching, and advisory release.
*   Identifying the specific vulnerability scanner used to discover the issues.
*   Listing related articles with more technical details and background regarding these vulnerability classes.
