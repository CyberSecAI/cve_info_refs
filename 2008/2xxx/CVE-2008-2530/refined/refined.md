Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in multiple PHP files of the QuickUpCMS application due to improper handling of user-supplied input in several parameters of different PHP files. Specifically, the `nr`, `d`, `m`, `y`, `id`, and `ser` parameters in `news.php`, `events2.php`, `events3.php`, `fotos2.php`, and `videos2.php` are vulnerable.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code. This is made possible due to the lack of proper input sanitization/validation.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to extract sensitive data from the database. This includes usernames, password hashes, and potentially other confidential information stored in the `cms_user` table as demonstrated in the provided exploit code.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerabilities are triggered via crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable PHP files. The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `nr`, `d`, `m`, `y`, `id`, or `ser` parameters in the URL.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have remote access to the web server hosting the vulnerable QuickUpCMS application.
    *   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send HTTP GET requests with crafted parameters to the vulnerable URLs.
    *   **Understanding of SQL:** Basic knowledge of SQL is needed to construct working SQL injection payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes a PHP script that demonstrates how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   The exploit script targets the `cms_user` table, extracting the `user` and `pass` fields.
*   The script uses `UNION SELECT` statements to retrieve the database information.
*   The exploit script provides examples of vulnerable URLs and usage scenarios.
* The script attempts to identify the position of the injected user and password by using the strings `::::`, `::1::`, and `::2::`.
