Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2893:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `news.php` file of the AJ HYIP ACME application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of `news.php`, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords. The provided exploit specifically targets the `admin` table to retrieve admin credentials.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** With access to admin credentials, an attacker can potentially gain full control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a modified `id` parameter in the `news.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft the injection.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` query to inject data into the results of the original SQL query. It leverages `concat_ws` to concatenate the `username` and `admin_password` from the `admin` table, separated by a colon (`:`). The attacker provides a dummy `id` value (-1) to ensure that no legitimate data will be returned.
*   The `0x4861636B65645F42795F48757373696E5F58` part of the exploit is a hexadecimal string representing "Hacked_By_Hussin_X", which serves as a marker to verify successful exploitation.

The provided information gives more details than the CVE description, specifically by providing the vulnerable file name (`news.php`), the vulnerable parameter (`id`), and the SQL injection payload.
