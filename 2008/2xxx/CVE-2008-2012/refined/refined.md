Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the PostSchedule module of PostNuke. Specifically, the `eid` parameter in the `index.php` script is vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The code does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials (usernames and passwords). The example provided shows how to extract user information from the `nuke_users` table.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed via HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `eid` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required.
*   **Technical Details:** The provided exploit string demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability:
    `index.php?module=PostSchedule&view=event&eid=-1')+union+select+0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,concat(pn_uname,char(58),pn_pass),10,11,12,13/**/from/**/nuke_users/**/where/**/pn_uid=2/*`

This SQL injection allows an attacker to select and concatenate `pn_uname` and `pn_pass` from the `nuke_users` table (or potentially other tables like `pn_users`).
