Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw within the `xsstream-dm` component of Joomla.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user input, specifically the `movie` parameter, before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the Joomla database. Specifically, the provided exploit targets the `jos_users` table to retrieve usernames and password hashes, which can be used to compromise the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a remote, unauthenticated web request. The attacker crafts a malicious URL targeting the vulnerable component.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker only needs network connectivity to the vulnerable Joomla instance and the ability to send HTTP requests. No prior authentication or special privileges are required. The attacker can be remote.

**Technical Details:**

The provided Perl exploit code demonstrates how to inject malicious SQL code into the `movie` parameter of the `com_xsstream-dm` component:

```perl
$com="com_xsstream-dm&Itemid";
# Lets star exploiting
$b = LWP::UserAgent->new() or die "Could not initialize browser\n";
$b->agent('Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)');

$host = $ARGV[0] . "/index.php?option=".$com."=69&movie=-1".$un."1,2,".$user.",4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22/**/from/**/".$tab."/**";
```

The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `jos_users` table. It injects `-1` to make the original query return no results and then uses `UNION SELECT` to select data from the targeted table. The `/**/` is used as a bypass method for some filtering mechanisms.

The exploit attempts to retrieve the username and password hash separately, then prints them to the output if found.
