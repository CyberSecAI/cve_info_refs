    {
      "source": "vuln.sg_348816d4_20250124_171646.html",
      "root_cause": "The FTP and WebDAV clients in BitKinex do not properly sanitize filenames containing directory traversal sequences received from a server.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper sanitization of filenames",
        "Directory traversal"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on a Windows user's system with the privileges of that user.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious FTP server sending directory traversal sequences in LIST command responses.",
        "Malicious WebDAV server sending directory traversal sequences in PROPFIND command responses."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to set up a malicious FTP or WebDAV server and trick the user into connecting to the malicious server and downloading files. The attacker is anonymous and does not require any prior user credentials.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be leveraged to write files into a user's Startup folder, leading to arbitrary code execution upon user login. The vulnerability affects BitKinex version 2.9.3.  The FTP client is vulnerable to both backslash and forward-slash directory traversal sequences, while the WebDAV client is vulnerable to backslash sequences."
