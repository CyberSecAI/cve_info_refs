Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
*   The application, SazCart 1.5.1, includes external files via parameters in HTTP requests, without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes remote files specified in the `_saz[settings][site_dir]` and `_saz[settings][site_url]` parameters of the URL. This allows an attacker to include a malicious file from a remote server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `_saz[settings][site_dir]` and `_saz[settings][site_url]` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on a server they control.
*   **`register_globals` enabled:** The server needs to have the PHP configuration setting `register_globals` enabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit examples show how to include remote files by crafting URLs with specific parameters, `_saz[settings][site_dir]` and `_saz[settings][site_url]`, pointing to a malicious PHP file hosted by the attacker (e.g., `http://rxh.freehostia.com/shells/c99in.txt`).
*   The provided exploit code indicates that the `register_globals` setting needs to be enabled on the server, which was a common (and insecure) setting in older versions of PHP.
*   The vulnerability exists in the `header.saz.php` file in the `layouts/default` directory and `login.php` in `admin/alayouts/default/pages/`.
