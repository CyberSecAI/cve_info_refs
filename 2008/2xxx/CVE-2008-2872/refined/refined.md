{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The sHibby sHop v2.2 application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the 'git' and 'sayfa' parameters. Additionally, the application has an accessible upgrade script and database file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Direct access to update script",
    "Direct access to database file"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful SQL injection could lead to unauthorized access or modification of database contents. The direct access to the update script could be exploited to compromise the application, and exposing the database file could reveal sensitive information. The identified tables include 'yasakli', 'ustmenu', 'urun_yorum', 'urun', 'ureticiler', 'tema', 'site_gel', 'siparis', 'sayfa', 'say_site', 'say_ip', 'say_hit', 'online', 'kategori', 'banner', and 'ayarlar'.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET parameter manipulation",
    "Direct URL access"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target application. Direct access vulnerabilities can be exploited if the attacker has knowledge of the location of the vulnerable files."
