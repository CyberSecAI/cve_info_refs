Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2135

**Vulnerable Software:** ezContents CMS Version 2.0.0

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `showdetails.php` and `printer.php` files. Specifically, the `contentname` and `article` parameters passed through `HTTP_GET_VARS` are directly incorporated into SQL queries without being sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection (CWE-89). Malicious SQL code can be injected through the `contentname` and `article` parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially read sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and email addresses from the `authors` table, as shown in the provided exploit examples.
- **Data Manipulation/Integrity Issues:**  An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database, depending on the database user permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `showdetails.php` and `printer.php` files. The malicious SQL code is embedded in the `contentname` or `article` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker requires remote access to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is needed for this exploit.
- **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker must have a general understanding of SQL injection techniques to construct a suitable exploit.
- **Basic understanding of the application:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable file names (`showdetails.php`, `printer.php`) and the vulnerable parameters (`contentname`, `article`).

**Technical Details**
The vulnerable code snippets are as follows:

```php
showdetails.php:
$strQuery = "SELECT * FROM ".$GLOBALS["eztbContents"]." WHERE contentname ='".$HTTP_GET_VARS["contentname"]."' AND language='".$GLOBALS["gsLanguage"]."'";

printer.php:
$strQuery = "SELECT * FROM ".$GLOBALS["eztbContents"]." WHERE contentname ='".$HTTP_GET_VARS["article"]."' AND language='".$GLOBALS["gsLanguage"]."'";
```

**Exploit Examples:**
The following exploit examples were provided and show how to extract data from the authors table:
```
http://site.com/[patch]/showdetails.php?contentname='/**/union/**/select/**/1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,concat(login,0x3a,userpassword,char(58,58),authoremail),30/**/from/**/authors/**/where/**/authorid=1/*
http://site.com/[patch]/printer.php?article='/**/union/**/select/**/1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,concat(login,0x3a,userpassword,char(58,58),authoremail),30/**/from/**/authors/**/where/**/authorid=1/*
```
These examples demonstrate a `UNION` based SQL injection that aims to extract the login, password, and email from the `authors` table for the author with `authorid` of 1.
