Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in Advanced Image Hosting (AIH) version 2.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `out.php` script. Specifically, the `t` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The script does not properly sanitize user input before incorporating it into SQL queries, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other data. The provided exploit specifically targets the `setting` table to retrieve admin credentials.
- **Potential for Data Manipulation:** While not explicitly shown in the exploit, SQL injection can often be used to modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `out.php` script with a malicious payload in the `t` parameter.
- **HTTP GET Request:** The exploit uses an HTTP GET request to send the malicious SQL payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server running the vulnerable application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP GET request.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker should have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads, although the provided exploit demonstrates a readily usable payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit targets the `setting` table and retrieves the admin username and password. The script outputs this information if the exploit is successful.
- The exploit uses `union select` to inject the malicious payload into the query and `concat` to format the output.
- The password in the `setting` table appears to be stored unencrypted, which compounds the issue and could be considered a vulnerability of itself although not strictly related to SQL Injection.

In summary, this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to extract sensitive information from the database due to a lack of input sanitization in the `out.php` script of Advanced Image Hosting version 2.1.
