Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in two of Jamroom's Admin Browser plugins. This occurs due to an insecure way of handling the `jamroom['jm_dir']` parameter in the `purchase.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The core weakness is that the `purchase.php` script includes a file based on a user-supplied parameter (`jamroom[jm_dir]`) without proper sanitization or validation, making it susceptible to including remote files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server by providing a malicious URL in the `jamroom[jm_dir]` parameter. This allows the attacker to gain full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `purchase.php` script, specifically by manipulating the `jamroom[jm_dir]` parameter.
- **Example URL:**  `http://www.site.com/include/plugins/jrBrowser/purchase.php?jamroom[jm_dir]=[shell]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Jamroom server.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know about the `purchase.php` script and how to exploit the `jamroom[jm_dir]` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is confirmed to affect Jamroom version 3.3.5.
- The issue was resolved in Jamroom 3.3.6.
- The exploit-db entry lists both CVE-2008-2886 and CVE-2008-2883, however the official description for CVE-2008-2886 could not be found to confirm if it is indeed related to this RFI.
