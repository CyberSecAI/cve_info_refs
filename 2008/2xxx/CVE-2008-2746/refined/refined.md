Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `login.php` script of GLLCTS2. Specifically, the `$_GET['detail']` parameter, used to construct a SQL query, is not sanitized before being used in the query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `detail` parameter, an attacker can manipulate the query, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or modifying data within the database.
*   **Unsanitized User Inputs:** The report mentions that there are about 5 unsanitized user inputs within the application, implying the potential for more SQL injections or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including admin IDs and passwords as demonstrated in the provided exploit code.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** By obtaining admin credentials, attackers can gain full control over the application.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The SQL injection can be a stepping stone for further attacks, such as data manipulation or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerable `detail` parameter is passed through an HTTP GET request to the `login.php` script.
*   **Malicious SQL Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious SQL payload and injects it into the `detail` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and injection techniques to craft a successful attack.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the server to inject the malicious code via the `detail` parameter.
