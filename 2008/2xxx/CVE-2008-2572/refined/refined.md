Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `leer_comentarios.php` script of the FlashBlog application. The `articulo_id` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection.  The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`articulo_id`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the database. The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how to extract sensitive information such as email addresses, usernames, and passwords from the `usuarios` table.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can lead to a variety of further attacks, such as modifying data, deleting data, or potentially taking control of the server depending on database permissions and configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `leer_comentarios.php` script.
*   **Manipulated Query Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `articulo_id` parameter by injecting SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any prior access to the target system.
*   **Basic Web Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests and have some understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**

*   The proof-of-concept uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to combine the results of the original query with a malicious query. This allows the attacker to inject their own SQL code and retrieve data from the database. The example uses `concat` to extract the data and `0x203a3a20` which is the hex code for " :: " as a separator.
*   The exploit examples show variations in the number of columns used in the `SELECT` statement, this is due to the differences in the number of columns in the tables across different installations. This shows that the attacker needs to probe the number of columns returned by the original query and adapt the injection to match.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a classic SQL injection flaw that arises from insufficient input validation.  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive user data.
