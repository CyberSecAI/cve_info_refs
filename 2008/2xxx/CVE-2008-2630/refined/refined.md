Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2630:

**Summary:**
The provided content from Exploit-DB indicates that CVE-2008-2630 is related to a blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the JooBlog component version 0.1.1 for Joomla. The exploit allows an attacker to extract the password hash of a user from the database by exploiting the vulnerable 'CategoryID' parameter. This information is not included in the CVE description.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization/validation of the `CategoryID` parameter in the `index.php?option=com_jb2&view=category` URL. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code into the query used to fetch blog category data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The attacker cannot see the results of their SQL queries directly. Instead, they infer the results by observing differences in the application's behavior.
- Vulnerable Parameter: The `CategoryID` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- Lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, specifically the password hash of a user from the `jos_users` table.
- Potential Full Database Access: With the extracted information and a successful login, the attacker may be able to leverage additional vulnerabilities to obtain access to the server infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL, injecting SQL code into the `CategoryID` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Joomla installation.
- Understanding of Blind SQL Injection: The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of blind SQL injection techniques to extract information from the database.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided exploit code uses a Perl script to automate the process of extracting the MD5 hash of a user's password, leveraging blind SQL injection against the CategoryID parameter.
- The vulnerability is specific to version 0.1.1 of the JooBlog component for Joomla.
