Subject: slash: possible SQL injection vulnerability

```
Package: slash
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Hi

A possible SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in slash.
The vulnerability was an SQL injection. Its effect was to allow a user
with no special authorization to read any information from any table the
Slash site's mysql user was authorized to read (which may include other
databases, including information_schema).

More information can be found here[0].

The upstream patch can be found here[1].

Cheers
Steffen

Hi,

the bug is well known to me, there are fixed packages available for
Etch and Sarge (since at that time Sarge still had security support).

Security Team has been informed about the bug on the day of the
initial disclosure, but I'm still waiting for them to publish an DSA
and publish a DSA and updated packages. I exchange a few mails
with them, but I haven't heard anything since end of January. (Last
mail from Moritz Muehlenhoff at Tue Jan 29 20:20:08 2008, last mail
from me to Moritz Tue Jan 29 20:36:55 2008.)

		Kind regards, Axel

Yes, I am aware that the stable team knows about it. The issue, however, is
unembargoed (and thus public and known) and nothing stops you from uploading
fixed packages to unstable.

I had a look at the etch packages you provided for the security update and saw
that there are some other changes to all the Makefiles.
Also there is some code added into the postinst to restart apache. Are these
changes really necessary for the security update?

Cheers
Steffen

Oh, ok.

Of course it is.

> and nothing stops you from uploading fixed packages to unstable.

That's not right. slash is currently uninstallable in Sid (due to the
dependency on Apache 1.3, see #429071) and I asked in my reply to the
last mail from the Security Team how to deal with this issue in in
unstable, but never got an answer. (If there are any misunderstandings
in regards of this, I'm happy if I can clear them.)

But fixing #429071 is quite a lot of work through which I'm currently
not completely through (and maybe I won't be for lenny).

IIRC they were other changes necessary because otherwise the upgrade
would fail (what's not the idea of a security update IMHO).

I initially took over the package in a quite bad shape, fixed nearly
all of the at that time open bugs for Etch. But I seem to have
overseen that there were also some bugs when upgrading the package. At
least my upgrade tests resulted in the package wanting to create new
databases, etc. I at least remember that I had to change some more
things than just the bug to make the upgrade work smooth.

I'm still not sure how to deal with this in unstable, but the next
upload for this package will surely go to experimental, so the package
shouldn't be that long in unstable anymore. Maybe this can be seen as
fix for the issue.

Hi Axel,
the second part of the patch that adds userfield to the
alphanumeric values is not part of the SQL injection fix.

To be precise this are two different vulnerabilities, the
SQL injection and this part of the patch fixes a XSS flaw
that got [CVE-2008-2553](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2553) assigned.

Please also reference this CVE id in the changelog.

Cheers
Nico

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi

I am not sure, if anyone asked for a CVE id for slash yet, if so please point
to it and disregard this request.

The Slashdote (also just known as Slash) vulnerability was an SQL injection.
Its effect was to allow a user with no special authorization to read any
information from any table the Slash site's mysql user was authorized to read
(which may include other databases, including information_schema).

Upstream announcement:
<http://www.slashcode.com/article.pl?sid=08/01/07/2314232>

Upstream patch:
<http://slashcode.cvs.sourceforge.net/slashcode/slash/Slash/Utility/Environment/Environment.pm?r1=1.223&r2=1.225>

Debian Bug report:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=484499>

Cheers
Steffen

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
