```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the insecure usage of the 'rep' parameter in the `derniers_commentaires.php` file. This allows an attacker to include and execute malicious code from a remote server.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP requests by manipulating the 'rep' parameter in the URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and must have access to a server that hosts the malicious file they want to include.
