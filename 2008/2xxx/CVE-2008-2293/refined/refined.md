{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure cookie handling",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application uses a cookie (`CommentSystemAdmin`) to manage admin sessions, but the cookie does not contain any authentication data. The presence of the cookie is enough for the application to treat the user as an admin",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain unauthorized administrative access to the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafting a cookie with the name `CommentSystemAdmin` and setting its value to 1.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to execute javascript on the affected domain, typically in the context of the victim's browser."
