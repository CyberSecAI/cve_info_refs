Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-2760:

**Vulnerability Details**
*   **Affected Software:** Multiple Xigla products, including:
    *   Absolute Live Support XE (ASP version 5.1)
    *   Absolute News Manager XE (ASP version 3.2)
    *   Absolute Banner Manager XE (ASP version)
    *   Absolute Form Processor XE (ASP version 4.0)
    *   Absolute Image Gallery XE
    *    Absolute Poll Manager XE
    *   Absolute Control Panel XE
*   **Root Cause:**  The root cause of the vulnerabilities is a lack of proper input sanitization in the affected products. This leads to two main types of vulnerabilities:
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Improper handling of user-supplied input within SQL queries, specifically through the "orderby" parameter in several `search.asp` files and `categoryid` in `gallery.asp`.
    *  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Inadequate sanitization of user-provided data, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts into web pages. Many forms fields are vulnerable in multiple files

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):**  The applications are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through various parameters. This is due to a lack of input sanitization.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):** The applications are susceptible to XSS attacks in multiple forms and admin pages due to improper output encoding.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete data. They could also gain complete control over the application and the server.
    *   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or the execution of arbitrary code within the user's browser.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The attack vector for SQL Injection is through manipulating specific parameters in the URL, such as `orderby` in `search.asp` or `categoryid` in `gallery.asp`, by injecting malicious SQL code.
    *  **XSS:**  The attack vector is by injecting malicious scripts via form fields.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Attackers need to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required in some instances such as gallery.asp.
    *   **XSS:** Attackers need to be able to inject malicious script into the vulnerable fields and have another user interact with it.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities by Product**

*   **Absolute Live Support XE:**
    *   SQL Injection in `search.asp` via `orderby` parameter.
    *   XSS in `search.asp` (all fields).
*   **Absolute News Manager XE:**
    *   SQL Injection in `search.asp` via `orderby` parameter.
    *   XSS in `anmviewer.asp`, `search.asp`, `editarticleX.asp`, and `publishers.asp` (all fields).
*   **Absolute Banner Manager XE:**
    *   SQL Injection in `searchbanners.asp` via `orderby` parameter.
    *   XSS in `searchbanners.asp` and `listadvertisers.asp` (all fields).
*   **Absolute Form Processor XE:**
    *   SQL Injection in `search.asp` via `orderby` parameter.
    *   XSS in `search.asp` and `users.asp` (all fields).
*   **Absolute Image Gallery XE:**
    *   SQL Injection in `gallery.asp` via `categoryid` parameter.
    *   XSS in `gallery.asp` and `search.asp` (all fields).
*    **Absolute Poll Manager XE:**
    *   SQL Injection in `search.asp` via `orderby` parameter.
    *   XSS in `search.asp` (all fields).
*    **Absolute Control Panel XE:**
     *   XSS in `admin/users.asp` (all fields).

**Mitigation:**
The provided solution is to "Edit the source code to ensure that all inputs are properly sanitized." This would involve implementing input validation and output encoding to prevent both SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
