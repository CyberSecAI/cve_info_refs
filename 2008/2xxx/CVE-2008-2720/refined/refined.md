Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities addressed in Gallery 2.2.5, which is related to CVE-2008-2720:

**Vulnerabilities Addressed in Gallery 2.2.5:**

1.  **XSS through host and path component of request URL:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application did not properly sanitize the host and path components of the request URL.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the URL, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This could potentially allow them to steal cookies, redirect users, or deface the website.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL with injected scripts.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to craft and deliver a malicious URL to a user.
    *   **Mitigation:** Input filtering was implemented to sanitize the complete request URL.
    
2.  **Information disclosure in album-select module:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The album-select module exposed album titles when a guest attempted to add a new album to a hidden album.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper access control leading to information disclosure.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized users could discover the titles of hidden albums.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By attempting to add a new album as a guest to a hidden album.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Guest user.
    *   **Mitigation:** Fixed exposure of album titles.

3.  **Permission escalation through zip archive extraction:**
    *  **Root Cause:** The application was creating sub-albums when adding items from a zip archive even if the active user did not have the necessary permissions to create sub-albums.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper access control and insufficient permission checks.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially create albums despite not having the required permissions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By uploading a specially crafted zip archive.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker with upload access.
    *   **Mitigation:** Sub-albums are no longer created when adding items from a zip archive if the active user does not have the necessary permission to do so.

4.  **Information disclosure through `embed.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `embed.php` script was susceptible to spoofing the remote address, leading to the disclosure of the local filesystem path of the Gallery 2 installation folder.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper handling of remote addresses and insufficient security measures in embed.php.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could gain knowledge of the server's file structure, making it easier to carry out further attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By spoofing the remote address when accessing `embed.php`.
    *    **Attacker Capabilities:**  Remote access to the embed.php script.
    *   **Mitigation:** `embed.php` is no longer susceptible to spoofing the remote address and thus no longer discloses the local filesystem path.

5.  **View permissions not enforced for password-protected items:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application allowed non-album items to be password-protected directly, but the full protection only applied to items within an album.
    *   **Weakness:** Inconsistent password protection implementation.
    *   **Impact:** View permissions were not enforced for non-album items, potentially allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to password-protected non-album items.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Access to a password protected item.
    *   **Mitigation:** Removed the option to protect non-album items directly. Password protection is only offered for albums.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The release notes explicitly state that users of all previous Gallery 2 versions are strongly encouraged to upgrade to version 2.2.5.
*   The update was primarily focused on addressing security vulnerabilities and did not include new features.
*   The content also indicates a discussion of a user encountering `Undefined offset` errors during the update, which was related to corrupted MANIFEST files. However, this is not a vulnerability, but rather a system issue with the upgrade process.
