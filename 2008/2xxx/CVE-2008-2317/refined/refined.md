Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-2317:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue in WebCore's handling of style sheet elements. Specifically, it occurs during the garbage collection process of JavaScript document elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap Corruption:** When a CSSStyleSheet object of a style element is copied and the original style element is deallocated, a reference to the `ownerNode` property of the copied CSSStyleSheet object leads to heap corruption.
*   **Garbage Collection Issue:** Improper handling during the garbage collection process related to style sheet elements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable system.
*   **Unexpected Application Termination:** The vulnerability can also cause the application to terminate unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Website:** The primary attack vector involves enticing the victim to visit a specially crafted malicious website.
*   **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires user interaction, as the victim needs to visit the malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **Ability to create and host a malicious website:** The attacker must be able to create and host a website with the malicious code to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in the WebKit component of Safari.
*   Apple has released an update to address this issue (Safari 3.2).

**Affected Systems:**
*   Mac OS X v10.4.11
*   Mac OS X v10.5.5
*   Windows XP
*   Windows Vista

**Mitigation:**
*   Updating to Safari 3.2 or applying the relevant security updates from Apple.

**Credit:**
*   An anonymous researcher working with the TippingPoint Zero Day Initiative is credited for reporting this issue.
