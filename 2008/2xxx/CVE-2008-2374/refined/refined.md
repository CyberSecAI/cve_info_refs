{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The SDP client functionality of the Bluetooth library contains a potential security issue since the length checks of the incoming data are not always present.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing input validation of string length fields in SDP packets"
    ],
    "impact": "A physically proximate attacker using a Bluetooth device with an already established trust relationship could send specially crafted requests, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution or a crash. Exploitation may also be triggered by a local attacker registering a service record via a UNIX socket or D-Bus interface.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physically proximate attacker using a Bluetooth device with an already established trust relationship",
        "Local attacker registering a service record via a UNIX socket or D-Bus interface"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs a Bluetooth device and requires either a pre-existing trust relationship with the target or local access to the target system."
