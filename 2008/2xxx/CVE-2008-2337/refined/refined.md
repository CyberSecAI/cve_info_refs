{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in several PHP scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authentication, access sensitive database information (e.g., passwords), and potentially modify or delete data. The provided examples demonstrate extraction of data, specifically user passwords from the `imgallery_hasla` table.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP scripts",
	"Specifically, `galeria.php`, `koment.php`, and `opis.php`."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and have knowledge of the application's structure and vulnerable parameters. The attacker does not require any special privileges on the server or inside the application itself."
