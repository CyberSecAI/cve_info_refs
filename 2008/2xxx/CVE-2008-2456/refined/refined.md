Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-2456:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `comic_id` parameter of the ComicShout application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `comic_id` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach/Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this SQL injection to retrieve sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, or other confidential information. Specifically, the provided exploit retrieves `site_admin` and `site_pass` from the `setup` table.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted GET request to the `index.php` page of the ComicShout application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **Basic knowledge of SQL:**  The attacker needs to know how to construct a basic SQL injection payload like a `UNION SELECT` statement.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses the following URL pattern, injecting a SQL `UNION SELECT` statement into the `comic_id` parameter:
    ```
    /index.php?comic_id=-1+UNION+SELECT+1,2,3,concat(site_admin,char(58),site_pass),5,6+FROM+setup/*
    ```
*   The injected SQL query retrieves the `site_admin` and `site_pass` fields concatenated using a colon, from the `setup` table. This indicates the application stores sensitive information in plain text or weakly encrypted manner.
*   The admin panel can be located at `admin.php`

**Additional Notes:**

* The application version affected is ComicShout 2.5.
* The content from exploit-db.com provides much more detail regarding the vulnerability than the CVE description, including the specific vulnerable parameter, the type of injection, and a sample exploit.

**Summary:**

CVE-2008-2456 describes a SQL injection vulnerability in ComicShout 2.5 that allows a remote attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the database by manipulating the `comic_id` parameter in a GET request.
