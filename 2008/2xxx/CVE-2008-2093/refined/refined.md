Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection flaw.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `user` parameter of the `com_comprofiler` component. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user passwords from the `jos_users` table (as shown in the provided example).
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is via an HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file with a crafted `user` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, no authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement for this exploit. The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft the injection.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit demonstrates a blind SQL injection. The attacker uses `mid((select password from jos_users limit 0,1),1,1) </Char(97)` as an example, which attempts to extract the first character of the password of the first user. The blind aspect means the results are not directly displayed but have to be inferred through comparing against character sets.

**Vulnerable Component:** Joomla! Component Community Builder 1.0.1 (specifically `com_comprofiler`).
