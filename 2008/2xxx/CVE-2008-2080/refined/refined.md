Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-2080:

**Root Cause:**

*   A boundary error exists within the `Read32s_64()` function of the Common Data Format (CDF) library when processing CDF files. Specifically, the library fails to properly validate the length tags within a CDF file before copying data to a stack buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability. The lack of proper length checks before copying data allows an attacker to provide a specially crafted CDF file with oversized length tags that can cause the buffer to overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.
*   **System Compromise:** Arbitrary code execution can be leveraged to potentially compromise the system.
*   **Application Crash:** If arbitrary code execution is not successful the vulnerability could crash the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted CDF file.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to open a malicious CDF file, often disguised or delivered through untrusted means.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** By enticing a user to open a malicious CDF file, a remote attacker can achieve remote exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious File Creation:**  The attacker needs to create a specially crafted CDF file that triggers the buffer overflow.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must have the ability to deliver the file to the user and convince them to open it.
*   **No Special Network Access:**  The vulnerability is not based on network service interaction but rather a file handling issue.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Alfredo Ortega of Core Security Technologies.
*   The vulnerability affects CDF versions 3.2 and earlier.
*   CDF 3.2.1 addresses the vulnerability.
*   The advisory was published by Core Security Technologies with Advisory ID: CORE-2008-0326.
