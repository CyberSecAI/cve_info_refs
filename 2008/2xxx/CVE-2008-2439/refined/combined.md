1. Overview of This Critical Patch Release
========================================================================
There are two security issues included in this critical patch.
a. This critical patch addresses the following potential security
issues in the Trend Micro OfficeScan server CGI modules.
- A vulnerability may allow attackers to trigger a buffer
overflow and execute arbitrary code using Web user
privileges.
- A vulnerability may allow attackers to trigger a null
pointer defect and cause the target child process to close.
This can potentially cause denial of service conditions.
b. This critical patch addresses a client directory traversal
vulnerability in the OfficeScan Update Agent.
The OfficeScan Update Agent client can receive requests from other
clients. For update file distribution, the request format is
"/activeupdate/".
When the OfficeScan Update Agent client complies with this
request, it can recognize and resolve the update file path
but does not verify it. As a result, if an attacker changes
the path to the directory traversal format, the following occur:
- directory traversal, and
- disclosure of file contents.

2. What's New
========================================================================
Critical patch 2439 resolves the following issues:
1. A buffer overflow vulnerability may be exploited to execute
arbitrary codes with Web user privileges.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Critical patch 2439 updates the CGI modules to resolve this issue.
2. By sending the crafted HTTP headers, the null pointer defect can
cause the target child process to close and potentially cause
denial of service conditions, if there is a series of inactive
processes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After applying critical patch 2439, the new CGI modules enhance
the error handling mechanism to address this issue.
3. A client directory traversal vulnerability in the OfficeScan
Update Agent may be exploited to traverse other directories and
view the contents of files.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Critical patch 2439 adds a security check feature to the
OfficeScan client to avoid client directory traversal.
After applying critical patch 2439, the OfficeScan client:
- Checks the update file path before opening it. It will only allow
access to files under the "activeupdate" folder.
- Normalizes the update file path before working on any file.
Normalizing the path converts any relative path characters to
a correct and complete path.

1. Overview of this Critical Patch Release
========================================================================
This critical patch addresses a vulnerability that is believed to
allow the retrieval a file's content on the OSCE client. This could
leak system information to hackers. Hackers could use this
information and cause additional damage. When the client is set as an
UpdateAgent, hackers can send a modified update request to retrieve
specified file content.
In the UpdateAgent function, TmListen parses incoming HTTP requests
and sends the requested files. The parsing mechanism has a logical
defect. Hackers could use this defect to their advantage and retrieve
specified file content.
1.1 Files Included in this Release
=====================================================================
Module File Name Build No.
---------------------- ------------
TmListen.exe 10.0.0.1220
TmListen.exe (64-bit) 10.0.0.1220
2. What's New
========================================================================
Critical Patch 1414 picks up the requested file path, normalizes (\*1)
it, and checks the folder. The normalized path should be a folder
inside the OSCE folder. No other folder paths allowed. Requests to
download OSCE configuration files are also denied.
\*1: Path Normalize: convert the path string to "real" and "full". For
example: "c:\windows\..\boot.ini¡" -> normalize processing
-> "C:\boot.ini"

5.1 Installation
=====================================================================
To install Critical Patch 1414:
1. Copy the Critical Patch executable file to a temporary folder
For example, "C:\temp".
2. Double-click the file. The modules are automatically copied to
the correct destination.
This Critical Patch installation package automatically rolls back the
Security Server to its original configuration if there are problems
during installation.
If you encounter problems after installation, do manually rollback
the installation.
5.2 Manual Rollback Procedure
=====================================================================
To manually roll back to the original configuration:
1. Locate the backup folder that the Critical Patch package created
in the
"\PCCSRV\Backup\CriticalPatch\_B1414" directory.
2. Copy the backup modules to the original folders.
3. Run the "TmTouch.exe" tool to trigger the Critical Patch
mechanism.
To run "TmTouch.exe":
a. Open a command prompt on the server.
b. At the command prompt, change the directory to
"PCCSRV\admin\utility\touch".
c. Use the "TmTouch.exe " command to run the touch
tool:
Note:  is the file that you want to roll back.
6. Post-installation Configuration
========================================================================
No post-installation steps are required.
Note: Trend Micro recommends that you update your scan engine and
virus pattern files immediately after installing this Critical Patch.

1. Overview of This Critical Patch Release
========================================================================
There are two security issues included in this critical patch.
a. This critical patch addresses the following potential security
issues in the Trend Micro OfficeScan server CGI modules.
- A vulnerability may allow attackers to trigger a buffer
overflow and execute arbitrary code using Web user
privileges.
- A vulnerability may allow attackers to trigger a null
pointer defect and cause the target child process to close.
This can potentially cause denial of service conditions.
b. This critical patch addresses a client directory traversal
vulnerability in the OfficeScan Update Agent.
The OfficeScan Update Agent client can receive requests from other
clients. For update file distribution, the request format is
"/activeupdate/".
When the OfficeScan Update Agent client complies with this
request, it can recognize and resolve the update file path
but does not verify it. As a result, if an attacker changes
the path to the directory traversal format, the following occur:
- directory traversal, and
- disclosure of file contents.

2. What's New
========================================================================
Critical patch 3087 resolves the following issues:
1. A buffer overflow vulnerability may be exploited to execute
arbitrary codes with Web user privileges.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Critical patch 3087 updates the CGI modules to resolve this issue.
2. By sending the crafted HTTP headers, the null pointer defect can
cause the target child process to close and potentially cause
denial of service conditions, if there is a series of inactive
processes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After applying critical patch 3087, the new CGI modules enhance
the error handling mechanism to address this issue.
3. A client directory traversal vulnerability in the OfficeScan
Update Agent may be exploited to traverse other directories and
view the contents of files.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Critical patch 3087 adds a security check feature to the
OfficeScan client to avoid client directory traversal.
After applying critical patch 3087, the OfficeScan client:
- Checks the update file path before opening it. It will only allow
access to files under the "activeupdate" folder.
- Normalizes the update file path before working on any file.
Normalizing the path converts any relative path characters to
a correct and complete path.

in the "\Trend Micro\PCCSRV\Backup\criticalPatch\_B3087" directory.
3. Copy the backup modules to the original folders.
\* Copy "PolicyServer\\*.\*" to: "\Trend Micro\PolicyServer"
\* Copy "PCCSRV\\*.\*" to: "\Trend Micro\PCCSRV\"
\* Copy "Tmlisten.exe" files from the backup location to the
following folders:
- PCCSRV\Pccnt\Common
- PCCSRV\Pccnt\Win64\X64
4. Start the services you stopped in step 1.
