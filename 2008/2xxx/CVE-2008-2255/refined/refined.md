  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2008-2255": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to attempts to access uninitialized memory in certain situations within Internet Explorer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption due to access of uninitialized memory."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote code execution with the same user rights as the logged-on user. An attacker could potentially take complete control of an affected system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker could host a specially crafted web page designed to exploit the vulnerability. Users are required to visit this malicious page via social engineering, such as clicking on a link sent through email or instant messenger.  Compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content could also host malicious content to exploit the vulnerability.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious web page and convince the victim to visit it. The attacker needs no special privileges on the victim's machine.",
       "mitigating_factors" : [
        "Users with fewer rights on the system are less impacted.",
        "Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express open HTML emails in the Restricted sites zone by default.",
         "Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 run in a restricted mode known as Enhanced Security Configuration, which mitigates attacks."
        ],
      "workarounds" : [
        "Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or disable it in the Internet and Local intranet security zones.",
        "Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to High to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting.",
        "Read email messages in plain text format if using Microsoft Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect from the HTML email attack vector."
