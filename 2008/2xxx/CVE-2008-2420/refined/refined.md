Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-2420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An unspecified bug exists in the OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) search functionality within stunnel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in how stunnel handles the validation of certificates against OCSP revocation status. It fails to properly prevent the authentication of a revoked certificate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can successfully authenticate using a revoked certificate, which should have been rejected by stunnel if OCSP validation had functioned correctly. This could allow an attacker to bypass authentication controls and potentially gain unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is remote and can be performed by an attacker who presents a revoked certificate to a stunnel server that has OCSP validation enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid certificate that has been revoked and be able to establish a connection with a stunnel server configured with OCSP validation enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to stunnel versions prior to 4.24.
- The issue only impacts users who have explicitly enabled OCSP validation in their stunnel configuration.

The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200808-08) provides significantly more detail than the description in the CVE. It clearly explains the affected component, the impact, and the steps to resolve the vulnerability through a software upgrade.
