# stunnel: Security bypass — GLSA **200808-08**

stunnel does not properly prevent the authentication of a revoked
certificate which would be published by OCSP.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/stunnel** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.24** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.24**< **4** |

### Background

The stunnel program is designed to work as an SSL encryption wrapper
between a remote client and a local or remote server. OCSP (Online
Certificate Status Protocol), as described in RFC 2560, is an internet
protocol used for obtaining the revocation status of an X.509 digital
certificate.

### Description

An unspecified bug in the OCSP search functionality of stunnel has been
discovered.

### Impact

A remote attacker can use a revoked certificate that would be
successfully authenticated by stunnel. This issue only concerns the
users who have enabled the OCSP validation in stunnel.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All stunnel users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/stunnel-4.24"
```
### References

* [CVE-2008-2420](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2420)

**Release date**

August 08, 2008

**Latest revision**

August 09, 2009: 02

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Stephen    2002-01-18 12:31:51 UTC  ``` There is no really printable documentation at gentoo.org for one who would  like to print it all out before he/she gets started. I myself would  prefer .pdf files. As was discussed in #gentoo, the xml versions are on the  cd, but that really does no good to anyone wanting to print it out before you  get started.  I could supply some documentation in a better printable format if so desired. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Christian Loitsch    2002-04-03 07:40:57 UTC  ``` its easy to get pdf-files from the online-html-pages. Just send it through: <http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc/pdf-o-matic.php> I tried it with the installation-manual, and the result were 13 colored pages.  It also "inserts" the ads though. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2002-08-05 15:34:03 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 4805](show_bug.cgi?id=4805 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - printer friendly pages") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2002-08-05 15:34:13 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 3887](show_bug.cgi?id=3887 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Printer Friendly documentation") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2002-08-05 15:37:32 UTC  ``` i think anything that is documentation on gentoo.org people would want in  printable versions ... pdf would work for most, but some would probably still  want text ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2002-08-26 13:28:04 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 7066](show_bug.cgi?id=7066 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Have printer friendly version of the install instructions.") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Sven Vermeulen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-08-31 04:27:26 UTC  ``` What documentation does one require (not type, but contents)? I think the install-guide is more than adequate and it's extremely easy to convert it into PDF.  ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Lloyd D Budd    2002-09-01 00:43:15 UTC  ``` This issue is very minor.  Of course, when you want to install, the trivialness of a convert is often an unwanted distraction -- if not worse.  My main desire ([Bug 7066](show_bug.cgi?id=7066 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Have printer friendly version of the install instructions.")) would be resolved by having a "print" friendly version available on the website. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Michael Cohen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-09-02 19:01:31 UTC  ``` We ought to set up some sort of NuxDocument system... zope.org search for nuxdocument... either that or a php pdf thing =) ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  John Davis (zhen) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-10-07 08:51:08 UTC  ``` Why don't we just add a tailored link to the pdf-o-matic at the beginning of  each doc?  //ZhEN ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  John Davis (zhen) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-10-13 12:29:09 UTC  ``` This really needs to be done. Can someone set this up serverside?????  //ZhEN ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Tirant    2002-11-04 12:27:41 UTC  ``` Yes, this should be done. PDF, PS, or any standard format. Pdf-o-matic doesn't work very well. I tried to make a pdf from <http://www.gentoo.org/doc/gentoo-security.html> and i got a 43 pages file + odd colors, while if i print it from html i get a 20pages file. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  John Davis (zhen) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-11-04 16:30:02 UTC  ``` This is being taken care of, and it is almost completed. //ZhEN ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  John Davis (zhen) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-12-04 14:35:44 UTC  ``` i know you are working on this - so here you go ;-) /ZhEN ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Eric Stockbridge    2002-12-11 18:57:07 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [11267](show_bug.cgi?id=11267 "RESOLVED FIXED - Printable XSLT Option ?") *** ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
