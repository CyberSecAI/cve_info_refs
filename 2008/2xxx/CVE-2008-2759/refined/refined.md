  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-2759",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within multiple Xigla product applications.",

      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to perform unauthorized database queries, potentially leading to data breaches or the modification of sensitive information. Also, attackers could inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially resulting in session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The SQL Injection vulnerabilities are exploited via crafted 'orderby' parameters in the 'search.asp' or 'searchbanners.asp' requests, or 'categoryid' in 'gallery.asp'.",
         "The XSS vulnerabilities are exploited by injecting malicious scripts into input fields within vulnerable ASP pages."
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable applications. No special privileges are needed if not admin pages are targeted. Admin pages require admin access.",
