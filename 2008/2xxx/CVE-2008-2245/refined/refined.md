  "CVE-2008-2245": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Color Management System (MSCMS) module of the Microsoft ICM component handles memory allocation. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted image file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap overflow when the Microsoft Color Management System (MSCMS) module of the Microsoft ICM component improperly allocates memory for a specially crafted image file.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, complete control of the affected system, allowing the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted image file",
      "Email containing a malicious image or document with embedded image",
      "Visiting a website hosting a malicious image."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to open a malicious image file. The attacker does not have to be authenticated. If successful, the attacker gains the same rights as the logged-in user. Systems where users have admin rights are at greater risk."
