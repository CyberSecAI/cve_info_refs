```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application suffers from SQL injection vulnerabilities due to unsanitized user-supplied input within the 'view', 'id', and 'sort' parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit the SQL Injection vulnerability to retrieve sensitive data such as usernames and passwords from the database. The XSS vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities.",
   "Attack vectors": [
        "HTTP GET requests with crafted SQL queries in the 'view', 'id' parameters of 'index.php', 'member.php', and 'post.php'",
         "HTTP GET requests with crafted XSS payloads in the 's', 'sort' parameters of 'index.php' and 'id' parameter of 'post.php'"
    ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and they do not need prior authentication. The magic quotes setting needs to be disabled for successful SQL injection."
