## Motorola Surfboard cable modem cross-site request forgery vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#643049

Original Release Date: 2008-04-29 | Last Revised: 2016-04-21

---

### Overview

Motorola Surfboard cable modems may contain a cross-site request forgery vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause an affected modem to reboot or reload its configuration.

### Description

| Cable modems are designed to deliver broadband Internet access via unused bandwidth on a cable television network. Some models of Motorola Surfboard cable modems have a web interface that can be used to view log files, check signal levels, restart the modem, and reload the modem's configuration. This web interface listens on a private ([RFC 1918](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)) IP address, and can not be accessed via the Internet. Users connected to the modem's LAN interface access the interface via a web browser.  Because the interface uses no authentication, other than binding to a private IP address, the Motorola Surfboard may be vulnerable to various cross-site request forgery ([XSRF](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSRF)) vulnerabilities. Note that to exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to convince a user to visit a specially crafted web page or open an HTML formatted email.*7 April 2016 update:* these vulnerabilities [have been found to affect](http://www.securityforrealpeople.com/2016/04/arris-motorola-surfboard-modem.html) more recent and rebranded ARRIS SURFboard SB6141 cable modem gateway products. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to take any action that an authorized user can including restarting the cable modem, or forcing it to reload its configuration file. While a cable modem is rebooting systems that rely on the affected modem will have limited ability to access the Internet. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**Restricting access to the Surfboard's web interface by using proxy filtering rules, router access control lists or firewall rules will mitigate this vulnerability. To effectively block access, the rules must prevent users on the LAN side of the cable modem from connecting to the web interface's IP address (usually 192.168.100.1). |

## Learn How MDR Can Help Your Organization

[Managed detection and response (MDR)](/en-us/products/managed-detection-and-response "Sophos Managed Detection and Response (MDR)") is a fully-managed, 24/7 service delivered by experts who specialize in detecting and responding to cyberattacks that technology solutions alone cannot prevent. By combining human expertise with protection technologies and advanced machine learning models, MDR analysts can detect, investigate, and neutralize advanced human-led attacks, preventing data breaches and ransomware.

The reality is that technology cannot stop every attack. Today’s well-funded adversaries abuse stolen credentials, security misconfigurations, and legitimate IT tools to bypass defense technologies, and they continually innovate and industrialize their approaches. The only way to reliably detect and neutralize determined attackers is with 24×7 eyes-on-glass delivered by security operations professionals. Providing this round-the-clock expert coverage is unrealistic for most organizations on their own and, as a result, companies are increasingly turning to specialist Managed Detection Response (MDR) providers for support.

[### What is MDR?

A fully-managed, 24/7 service delivered by experts who specialize in detecting and responding to cyberattacks.](#card-micro-colorbox-274301)
## What is Managed Detection and Response (MDR)?

MDR is a fully-managed, 24/7 service delivered by cybersecurity experts who specialize in detecting and responding to cyberattacks. By combining human expertise with protection technologies and advanced machine learning models, MDR security analysts can detect, investigate, and neutralize advanced human-led attacks, preventing data breaches and ransomware.

[### Why MDR?

MDR services provide the expertise for you, enabling organizations to expand their security operations capabilities without expanding their headcount.](#card-micro-colorbox-275801)
## What are the Benefits of MDR?

With MDR you benefit from the breadth and depth of experience of the provider’s analysts capabilities. Threat detection and response is time consuming and unpredictable. The urgent nature of the work can prevent teams from focusing on more strategic — and often more interesting — challenges. Working with an MDR service enables you to free up IT capacity to support business-focused initiatives. MDR services provide the expertise for you, enabling organizations to expand their security operations capabilities without expanding their headcount.

[### MDR Benefits

One of the major advantages of using an MDR provider over in-house only security operations programs is elevated protection against ransomware and other advanced cyber threats.](#card-micro-colorbox-304416)
## What are the Benefits of MDR

With MDR you benefit from the breadth and depth of experience of the provider’s analysts. A MDR vendor will experience a far greater volume and variety of attacks than any individual organization, giving them a level of expertise that is almost impossible to replicate in house. Threat detection and response is time consuming and unpredictable. The urgent nature of the work can prevent teams from focusing on more strategic — and often more interesting — challenges. Working with a MDR service enables you to free up IT capacity to support business-focused initiatives. Adversaries are most active at the times when your IT team is least likely to be online, such as evenings, weekends, and holiday periods. By providing 24/7 coverage, MDR services provide considerable reassurance and peace of mind. Threat detection and response is a highly complex operation. MDR services provide the expertise for you, enabling organizations to expand their security operations capabilities without expanding their headcount. Maintaining a 24/7 threat hunting team is expensive. By leveraging economies of scale, MDR services provide a cost-effective way to secure your organization and stretch your cybersecurity budget further.

[### Security Telemetry

Security telemetry is gathered from across the full IT ecosystem: endpoint, firewall, network, cloud, email, and identity solutions to provide a complete view of your security posture.](#card-micro-colorbox-275811)
## What is Security Telemetry?

The more analysts can see, the faster they can respond. Threat intelligence and business context are added to the data to provide a more complete view. Related security events are grouped into clusters for complete and efficient investigation. Highly-trained analysts proactively detect threats that bypass security products. They look for tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly used by cybercriminals and threats that may bypass various security tools. Analysts determine the scope and severity of the threat and identify next steps. Analysts interrupt the attack to prevent it from spreading, while removing the malware and isolating the impacted systems. Analysts perform root cause analysis to fully eliminate the attacker and prevent recurrence.

[### MDR Service Providers

An MDR service provider offers a technology stack covering your endpoints, networks, cloud environments, and other areas of your IT infrastructure. MDR providers detect and remediate cyberthreats 24/7/365 while providing threat intelligence services.](#card-micro-colorbox-304411)
## What Does a MDR Provider Offer?

* 24/7/365 monitoring to help you identify cyberthreats across your IT infrastructure.
* Support from threat hunters, security analysts, and other cybersecurity professionals that can teach you about cyberthreats and help you identify and respond to them.
* Threat investigations that you can use to learn about cyberthreats and cybercriminals' TTPs and find out why and how cyberattacks are happening.
* Threat intelligence that you can use to understand cyberthreats and what can be done to stop them.
* Security reports that you can use to comply with HIPAA, GDPR, and other data security regulations.

[### MDR, EDR, and XDR

MDR is a managed service that blends EDR (endpoint detection and response) and XDR (extended detection and response) capabilities. The service is managed by an MDR provider that detects and remediates cyberthreats.](#card-micro-colorbox-312751)
## MDR vs. EDR vs. XDR: What You Need to Know

MDR is a managed service that blends [EDR](/en-us/products/endpoint-antivirus/edr "EDR security") and XDR capabilities. The service is managed by an MDR provider that looks for cyberthreats across your IT infrastructure. If a threat is found, your MDR provider responds to the threat for you or notifies you about it. In either scenario, your MDR provider keeps you in the loop about cyberthreats and what you can to guard against them.

An EDR service classifies known threats as it identifies them. The service looks for unusual or suspicious activity across your endpoints. It also uses a database that contains threat insights to compare this activity against cyberthreats. If your EDR service identifies a threat, it automatically responds to it for you.

XDR goes beyond EDR, since it looks for threats across your IT infrastructure. An XDR service tracks things like abnormal network traffic and anomalous cloud activity that indicate a cyberattack may be underway. It provides [threat intelligence](https://assets.sophos.com/X24WTUEQ/at/vhfnqbtsg5kxcxhq6kcvt6h/sophos-threat-intelligence-ds.pdf) to help you understand security issues across your IT infrastructure. You can use this threat intelligence to find ways to keep pace with current and emerging cyberthreats and level up your security posture.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
