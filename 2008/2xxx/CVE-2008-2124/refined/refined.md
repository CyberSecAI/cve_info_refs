{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the 'lg' parameter of the 'print.asp' script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database, or potentially gain control over the server via the underlying database system. In this specific instance, it's a Blind SQL injection, which means the attacker will need to use techniques to infer information from the responses.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is the 'lg' parameter within the URL of the 'print.asp' file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application. No other special privileges are required."
