How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  ## vBulletin 3.7.1 PL1 & 3.6.10 PL1 Released

  Mon 9 Jun '08, 3:16am

  **vBulletin 3.7.1 PL1 / vBulletin 3.6.10 PL1**

  The recent discovery of an obscure method in which to expose a cross-site scripting (XSS) error in vBulletin when using specific browser software means that it is necessary to release Patch Level (PL) versions of both 3.7.1 and 3.6.10.

  We recommend that all customers upgrade to protect themselves.

  **Upgrading from 3.7.1 or 3.6.10**

  If you are already running 3.7.1 or 3.6.10, the process you will be required to follow to make your board immune to the XSS problem is very simple. Visit the [Patches section of the vBulletin Members' Area](http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php) and download either the patch for 3.7.1, or the patch for 3.6.10, according to the version you are currently running, then extract the files from the archive you downloaded, then upload the files to your board via FTP etc., overwriting the existing files. This will update your version to the PL1 release.

  There is no need to run an upgrade script if you are already running 3.7.1 or 3.6.10.

  **Upgrading from Versions Earlier than 3.7.1 or 3.6.10**

  If you are **not** already running 3.7.1 or 3.6.10, you should download the most latest version from the [Members' Area](http://members.vbulletin.com) and perform an upgrade as normal.

  [Full instructions for upgrading vBulletin are available here.](http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/upgrade)

  **PHP and MySQL Requirements**Please note that vBulletin 3.7.x requires at least **PHP 4.3.3** and **MySQL 4.0.16** or later.

  However, we recommend that vBulletin 3.7.x is run on PHP 5.2.6 with APC (or a similar opcode cache) and MySQL 5.0.51 for best performance and stability.

  **End of Life for PHP 4**

  The PHP group has announced the end of life for PHP 4. We strongly recommend that customers update their servers to PHP 5.2.6 if they are still running PHP 4. vBulletin 3.7.1 supports PHP 5 and MySQL 5 fully, though you may need to disable strict mode for MySQL, see [here](http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/editconfig) on how to enable 'force\_sql\_mode'.

  *Note*: We will continue to support PHP 4 in the vBulletin 3 series.

  **Download vBulletin 3.7.1 PL1 or 3.6.10 PL1**

  As usual, both versions released today are available for all customers with valid, active licenses to download from the vBulletin Members' Area.
