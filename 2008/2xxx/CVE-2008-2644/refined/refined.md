    "Source": "www.exploit-db.com_9a66081f_20250125_190839.html",
    "Root cause": "The `catalog.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `idp` and `category` parameters.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.",
    "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `idp` or `category` parameters in the `catalog.php` URL.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."

    "Root cause": "The `catalog.php`, `search.php`, `bb.php`, and `order.php` scripts are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to account hijacking, session theft, or the execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser.",
    "Attack vectors": "By injecting malicious scripts into the `data` parameter of `catalog.php`, the `keyword` parameter of `search.php`, the `page` parameter of `bb.php`, and the `new_s` parameter of `order.php`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
