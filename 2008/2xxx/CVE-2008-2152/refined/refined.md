Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow in the `rtl_allocateMemory()` function within OpenOffice.org's custom memory allocation routine. This function is located in the `sal/rtl/source/alloc_global.c` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is that an attacker can manipulate file data to cause an integer overflow when calculating the memory allocation size. This overflow results in a smaller-than-required buffer being allocated.
- **Heap Overflow:** When data is written into this undersized buffer, a heap buffer overflow occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful heap overflow can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker's code would execute with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org. This allows an attacker to gain control over a local user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Document:** The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted document, such as a word processing or spreadsheet file, designed to trigger the integer overflow.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to open the malicious document with a vulnerable version of OpenOffice.org.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Document Creation:** The attacker must have the ability to create or manipulate a document to trigger the overflow.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker typically needs to use social engineering to convince the user to open the malicious document.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require special privileges; they are an unprivileged remote attacker, as long as they can trick the user to open the document.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in OpenOffice.org versions 2.0 up to and including 2.4.
- The issue is resolved in OpenOffice.org 2.4.1.
- The vulnerability was discovered by an anonymous researcher working with iDefense VCP.
- There was no known workaround other than upgrading to the patched version.
