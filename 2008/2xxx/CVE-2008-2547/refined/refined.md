Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2547:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An overly long Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) passed to `msiexec.exe` leads to a stack buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the GUID.
- Overwriting the stack and SEH (Structured Exception Handler).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code execution is possible, although the unicode conversion process makes it more difficult to achieve reliably.
- Potential for remote exploitation exists, possibly through ActiveX controls that pass GUIDs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Executing `msiexec.exe` with a malformed GUID as a command-line argument, specifically within the `/x` parameter.
- Exploitation may be possible through other avenues including ActiveX controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute `msiexec.exe` with a crafted, overly long GUID.
- For remote exploitation, an attacker may leverage a vector that passes the malformed GUID to the vulnerable application via a different mechanism, for example through an ActiveX control.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory specifically mentions that versions 4.5.6001.22159 and 3.1.4000.1823 of the Windows Installer (`msiexec.exe`) are vulnerable. Other versions are assumed to be vulnerable but are untested.
- The exploit is described as being complicated by a unicode conversion.
- The advisory provides an example command showing how to trigger the overflow: `msiexec.exe /x {}`
