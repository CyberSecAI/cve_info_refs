Root cause of vulnerability:
The phpVID application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in several parameters across different scripts.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- SQL Injection: Vulnerable parameters include 'cat' in `groups.php` and 'n' in `browse_videos.php` and `members.php`
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Vulnerable parameters include 'n' in `browse_videos.php`, 'cat' in `groups.php`, 'query' in `search_results.php`, 'browse' in `members.php`, 'next' in `login.php`, and 'type' in `groups.php`
- CRLF Injection:  The 'query' parameter in `search_results.php` allows for CRLF injection.

Impact of exploitation:
- SQL Injection: Attackers could potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database. They could also possibly gain unauthorized access to the application.
- XSS: Attackers can execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between their browser and the server, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, or malicious redirects.
- CRLF Injection: Attackers can manipulate HTTP headers, potentially leading to various exploits like cache poisoning or session fixation.

Attack vectors:
- SQL Injection: By crafting malicious SQL queries in the vulnerable parameters via HTTP GET requests.
- XSS: By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameters via HTTP GET requests.
- CRLF Injection: By injecting CRLF characters into the 'query' parameter of `search_results.php` via HTTP GET requests.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Remote attacker can exploit the vulnerabilities through a web browser by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the target application.
- No special privileges are needed, but an attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.
