{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `GLOBALS[_BIGACE][DIR][admin]` parameter, before including it in a file path, leading to Remote File Inclusion (RFI).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote code on the vulnerable server by manipulating the `GLOBALS[_BIGACE][DIR][admin]` parameter, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP GET requests by injecting a malicious URL into the `GLOBALS[_BIGACE][DIR][admin]` parameter of vulnerable PHP files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server and host a malicious file on a remote server that can be included by the vulnerable application."
