Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
* The `ipn.php` script within the KubeLance application is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `ipn.php` script allows inclusion of local files. This is achieved by using a parameter `i` which is then used to include the file. The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to specify arbitrary local files as input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker can include and potentially execute arbitrary local files, leading to:
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Viewing sensitive files such as configuration files, source code, or database credentials.
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** In some cases, it might be possible to upload malicious code and use the file inclusion vulnerability to execute it, achieving code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `ipn.php` script.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:** The `i` parameter of the `ipn.php` script is used to specify the local file to be included. An attacker can modify this parameter to specify any local file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server hosting the KubeLance application.
*   **Basic Understanding of Web Application Security:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate URL parameters.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication, making it readily accessible.

**Additional Details**
* The exploit is confirmed to affect all versions of Kubelance up to 1.6.4.
* The exploit uses a null byte injection technique (`%00`) to potentially truncate the path, forcing the application to interpret the attacker's input literally as a file path
* The exploit is triggered through a URL like `www.x.com/script_path/ipn.php?i=localfile%00`.
* The `rapidshare` link for download of the vulnerable software suggests that the software is not available from a direct source.
