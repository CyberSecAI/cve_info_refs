Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2008-2187:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `mjguest.php` script when handling the `do=redirect`, `level`, `alert`, and `goto` parameters. Specifically, the `level` parameter is vulnerable to XSS, and the `goto` parameter is vulnerable to redirection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `level` parameter allows injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Open Redirection:** The `goto` parameter allows redirecting users to arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the user's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking: stealing user cookies and impersonating them.
    - Data theft: accessing sensitive information on the page.
    - Defacement: modifying the page's content.
    - Phishing: redirecting users to fake login pages.
- **Open Redirection:** An attacker can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially leading to:
    - Phishing attacks: redirecting users to fake login pages.
    - Drive-by downloads: redirecting users to websites hosting malware.
    - Social engineering attacks: deceiving users into divulging sensitive information.
    - Loss of user trust and reputation damage of the legitimate site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL targeting the `mjguest.php` script.
- The attacker would need to trick the victim into clicking the malicious URL or embedding the URL into other vulnerabilities, such as XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and get a victim to visit it.
- No special privileges are required; any user can craft and use a vulnerable URL.
