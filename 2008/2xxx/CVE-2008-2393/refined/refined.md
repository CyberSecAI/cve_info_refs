Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2393

**Vulnerability Description:** SQL Injection vulnerability in EntertainmentScript 1.4.0.

**Root Cause:** The `play.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `id` parameter. The script does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter of the `play.php` script, an attacker can manipulate the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and email addresses.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Full control of the database:**  The attacker could gain full control of the database server if the database user has sufficient rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `play.php` script with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL queries.

**Exploit Example:**
The provided exploit in the content demonstrates how to inject SQL code using a `UNION SELECT` statement.
`www.Site.com/play.php?id=-96969+union+select+0x28284d722e53514c2929,concat(username,0x3a3a3a3a3a,password),3,4,email,6+from+users/*`
This example attempts to extract username, password, and email from the `users` table of the database.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit-db content provides a live demo link demonstrating the vulnerability on a demo site which is helpful for verification.
*   The content mentions the vulnerable script name (`play.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`id`), which are crucial details for understanding the vulnerability.
* The provided exploit code directly shows how an attacker can obtain the username and password from the users table
