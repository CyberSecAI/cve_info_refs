```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The variable `$cm_imgpath` is not declared in the `graphie.php` file, allowing an attacker to control its value through the `cm_imgpath` parameter in the URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Disclosure",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `cm_imgpath` parameter. This includes sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request to `graphie.php` with a modified `cm_imgpath` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special capabilities are mentioned other than access to the vulnerable application through the network"
