```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Frontend Filemanager (air_filemanager) extension fails to properly filter user input and filter uploaded files
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): User-supplied input is not sanitized, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript.
  - Remote Code Execution: Insufficient filtering of uploaded files allows execution of arbitrary PHP script code.
- Impact of exploitation:
  - XSS: Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser.
  - Remote Code Execution: Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- Attack vectors:
  - XSS: By injecting malicious JavaScript code through user input fields.
  - Remote Code Execution: By uploading malicious PHP files through the file manager.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable file manager interface, either directly or by manipulating other users into doing so.
