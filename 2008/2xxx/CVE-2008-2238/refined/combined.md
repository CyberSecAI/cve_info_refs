How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# NeoOffice 2.2.5 Patch 3 New Features

### From NeoWiki

Jump to: [navigation](#column-one), [search](#searchInput)

After we added [many new features](/index.php/NeoOffice_2.2.5_New_Features "NeoOffice 2.2.5 New Features") in September's NeoOffice 2.2.5 release, we have continued work on additional features for our users. In November 2008 we released NeoOffice 2.2.5 Patch 3 with the following new features:

* [Mac OS X Services support](#Mac_OS_X_Services_support)
* [Experimental Snow Leopard support](#Experimental_Snow_Leopard_support)
* [Security fixes](#Security_fixes)

Get these new features by installing the latest patch from the [NeoOffice patch download page](http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/patch.php "http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/patch.php").

Special thanks go to all who have [donated to the NeoOffice.org project](http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/donate.php "http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/donate.php") since we released NeoOffice 2.2.5. Without everyone's donations, not only would we have been unable to implement the these new features, we would not have been able to provide rapid investigation and fixing of significant bugs found by users.

## Mac OS X Services support

Starting with NeoOffice 2.2.5 Patch 3, many of the menus within the NeoOffice :: Services menu will be enabled whenever you highlighted data in your document. When you select any of these submenus, the highlighted data will be sent to the Mac OS X application that matches to the Services menu that you select.

For example, if you select the NeoOffice :: Services :: TextEdit :: New Window Containing Selection menu, a new document will be created in the TextEdit application and the highlighted data in your NeoOffice document will be copied to that new TextEdit document. For another example, if you select the NeoOffice :: Services :: Spotlight menu, Mac OS X will do a Spotlight search for the highlighted data in your NeoOffice document.

Please note that at this time NeoOffice does not support Mac OS X services that change the highlighted data in your document. Only services that read your highlighted data are supported. This means that services like NeoOffice :: Services :: ChineseTextConverter will be disabled in NeoOffice.

## Experimental Snow Leopard support

Recently, Apple has released a developer seed of [Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/snowleopard/ "http://www.apple.com/macosx/snowleopard/"). Due to changes in Snow Leopard, starting with NeoOffice 2.2.5 Patch 3, NeoOffice will now run on the latest Snow Leopard developer seed. We expect that users will find bugs in NeoOffice when running on Snow Leopard that do not exist in earlier versions of Mac OS X, so users should consider our Snow Leopard support to be very experimental.

## Security fixes

Two security vulnerabilities were found and fixed in NeoOffice's underlying OpenOffice.org code. Starting with NeoOffice 2.2.5 Patch 3, NeoOffice includes OpenOffice.org's fixes for these two vulnerabilities:

* [Manipulated WMF files can lead to heap overflows and arbitrary code execution](http://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2008-2238.html "http://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2008-2238.html")
* [Manipulated EMF files can lead to heap overflows and arbitrary code execution](http://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2008-2237.html "http://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2008-2237.html")

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [openoffice.org-l10n](/security/cves?package=openoffice.org-l10n) -

## Details

USN-677-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenOffice.org. The changes required that

openoffice.org-l10n also be updated for the new version in Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

Original advisory details:

Multiple memory overflow flaws were discovered in OpenOffice.org's handling of

WMF and EMF files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted

document, a remote attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code with user

privileges. ([CVE-2008-2237](/security/CVE-2008-2237), [CVE-2008-2238](/security/CVE-2008-2238))

Dmitry E. Oboukhov discovered that senddoc, as included in OpenOffice.org,

created temporary files in an insecure way. Local users could exploit a race

condition to create or overwrite files with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-4937](/security/CVE-2008-4937))

### Reduce your security exposure

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# OpenOffice.org: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200812-13**

Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenOffice.org might allow for user-assisted
execution of arbitrary code or symlink attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-office/openoffice** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.0** |

| Package | **app-office/openoffice-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.0** |

### Background

OpenOffice.org is an open source office productivity suite, including
word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, drawing, data charting,
formula editing, and file conversion facilities.

### Description

Two heap-based buffer overflows when processing WMF files
(CVE-2008-2237) and EMF files (CVE-2008-2238) were discovered. Dmitry
E. Oboukhov also reported an insecure temporary file usage within the
senddoc script (CVE-2008-4937).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
document, resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code. A local
attacker could perform symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary files on
the system. Both cases happen with the privileges of the user running
the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenOffice.org users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-3.0.0"
```

All OpenOffice.org binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-3.0.0"
```

may allow a remote unprivileged user who provides a StarOffice/StarSuite
document that is opened by a local user to execute arbitrary commands on
the system with the privileges of the user running StarOffice/StarSuite. No
working exploit is known right now.

#### 2. Affected releases

All versions prior to OpenOffice.org 2.4.2

#### 3. Symptoms

There are no predictable symptoms that would indicate this issue has
occurred

#### 4. Relief/Workaround

There is no workaround. See "Resolution" below.

#### 5. Resolution

This issue is addressed in the following release:

**OpenOffice.org 2.4.2**

*Note: OpenOffice.org 3.0 is not affected by this
vulnerability.*

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# USN-677-1: OpenOffice.org vulnerabilities

26 November 2008

OpenOffice.org vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [openoffice.org](/security/cves?package=openoffice.org) -
* [openoffice.org-amd64](/security/cves?package=openoffice.org-amd64) -

## Details

Multiple memory overflow flaws were discovered in OpenOffice.org's handling of

WMF and EMF files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted

document, a remote attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code with user

privileges. ([CVE-2008-2237](/security/CVE-2008-2237), [CVE-2008-2238](/security/CVE-2008-2238))

Dmitry E. Oboukhov discovered that senddoc, as included in OpenOffice.org,

created temporary files in an insecure way. Local users could exploit a race

condition to create or overwrite files with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-4937](/security/CVE-2008-4937))
