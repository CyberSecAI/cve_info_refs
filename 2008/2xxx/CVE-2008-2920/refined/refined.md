```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application has a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the 'page' parameter of the index.php file, due to unsanitized input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Blind SQL Injection",
     "Insecure file manager access"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of the SQL injection could allow an attacker to read sensitive information from the database, possibly including user credentials. The file manager vulnerability allows an attacker to upload/edit/delete/move files, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET request to index.php with a crafted 'page' parameter for blind SQL injection",
        "Accessing the file manager through /ezcms/admin/filemanager/"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application and have knowledge of the vulnerable URL parameters. For file manager access, the attacker needs to know the path of the file manager."
