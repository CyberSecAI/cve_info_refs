Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2909

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `results.php` file in Clever Copy 3.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `searchterm` parameter. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of proper input validation/sanitization in the `results.php` script
- Direct embedding of user-supplied data into SQL queries

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - Disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., administrator credentials, user data)
  - Modification or deletion of data
  - Complete compromise of the application and database server

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `results.php` with a crafted `searchterm` parameter containing malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker with network access to the vulnerable application
- Basic understanding of SQL syntax and injection techniques

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Perl exploit demonstrates how an attacker can leverage the vulnerability. It first checks for vulnerability by injecting a single quote in the `searchtype` parameter which causes an SQL syntax error. Then it injects a crafted SQL query to retrieve the administrator username and password hash by using a `UNION SELECT` statement in the `searchterm` parameter. The exploit concatenates the username and password using `concat` and wraps it with some chars to easily extract it with a regex.
- The exploit uses the following payload to extract admin credentials: `?start=0&searchterm=CCNews&searchtype=category union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,concat(char(104,48,121,116,51,114),username,0x3a,password,char(104,48,121,116,51,114)),8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 from CC_admin/*`
