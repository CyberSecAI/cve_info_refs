Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2008-2250:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Windows kernel improperly validates properties of a window passed during the new window creation process. This occurs when a parent window passes input to a child window during creation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient validation of window properties within the Windows kernel.
- The vulnerability allows for an attacker to provide malicious window properties, allowing for execution of arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- This grants the attacker complete control of the affected system.
- The attacker can install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- Essentially, this vulnerability enables privilege escalation from a local user to the highest level (kernel mode).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on to the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local user access to the targeted machine.
- They need to be able to execute code on the system.
- The attacker must craft a specially designed application that triggers the vulnerability during window creation.
