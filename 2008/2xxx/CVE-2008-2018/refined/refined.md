Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `template.class.php` file within the `AssignUser` function. Specifically, the code iterates through user database fields and replaces placeholders like `{user.DATABASEFIELD}` with the corresponding database value directly into a buffer that is later output to the page. This behavior allows for arbitrary database information disclosure.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Database Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the direct exposure of database information due to the insecure templating mechanism.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code doesn't validate or sanitize the user-provided `DATABASEFIELD` before using it in the string replacement, allowing any valid database field to be exposed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can retrieve sensitive information, such as user passwords (including the administrator's), by inserting the corresponding placeholders in a user comment.
    *   Potentially, the entire database could be enumerated using valid database field names as placeholders.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by posting specially crafted comments on a user's profile within the vulnerable PHPizabi application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a registered user of the PHPizabi application.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to post comments on user profiles.
    *   The attacker needs to know valid database field names to retrieve specific data.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in `PHPizabi v0.848b C1 HFP3` and possibly older versions.
* The exploit is triggered when viewing the comments on a user's profile.
* The disclosed passwords are in MD5 hashed format.
