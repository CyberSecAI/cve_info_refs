Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2310:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A format string vulnerability exists in the `c++filt` utility, which is a debugging tool used for demangling C++ and Java symbols.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core issue is the improper handling of format strings within the `c++filt` tool. This vulnerability allows an attacker to control the format string, leading to a variety of potential issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Unexpected application termination (crash).
    - Arbitrary code execution. This means the attacker could potentially run malicious code on the target system, gaining control over it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by passing a maliciously crafted string as input to `c++filt`. The specific means of delivering this crafted string (e.g. through a command line argument, user input, another program's output piped to it) is not specified in the document, leaving it open to multiple options.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious input to the `c++filt` utility. The level of access needed is not specified but would likely require the ability to execute or interact with `c++filt` with the malicious input.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is specific to systems running Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.5.3 and Mac OS X Server 10.5 through 10.5.3, and does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X 10.5. The vulnerability was addressed by improving the handling of format strings in a security update.
