      "cve": "CVE-2008-2944",
      "details": "This CVE is related to a race condition in the Linux kernel's utrace functionality that can lead to a crash. The root cause lies within the interaction between utrace_detach() and report_quiescent(). Specifically, a race exists in setting engine flags and ops within utrace_detach(), which then causes issues when acting on those settings in report_quiescent().\n\nThe vulnerability arises because the utrace lock is not held when report_quiescent() is called. If utrace_detach() is executed concurrently, it modifies the engine flags to UTRACE_EVENT(QUIESCE) | UTRACE_ACTION_QUIESCE and then calls rcu_assign_pointer(engine->ops, &dead_engine_ops). However, at the time of the REPORT call, the engine's ops might still point to the live ptrace ops, which do not have a report_quiesce callback, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. This race condition can be triggered by rapidly attaching and detaching to a process using ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH).\n\nThe impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a kernel crash, resulting in a denial-of-service. The attack vector involves using ptrace to attach to a process and can be triggered by a normal user against processes they do not have the permissions to attach to. The required capabilities for the attacker is the ability to call ptrace. The attacker does not need to be privileged but must be able to execute ptrace against a running process. The vulnerability is triggered by calling PTRACE_ATTACH and PTRACE_DETACH in a race condition.",
