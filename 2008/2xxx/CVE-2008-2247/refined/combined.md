How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Educating Information Workers About Outlook Web Access

* Article
* 01/23/2017
## In this article

Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 will reach end of support on April 11, 2017. To stay supported, you will need to upgrade. For more information, see [Resources to help you upgrade your Office 2007 servers and clients](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=838723).

***Applies to:** Exchange Server 2007, Exchange Server 2007 SP1, Exchange Server 2007 SP2, Exchange Server 2007 SP3*

Microsoft Office Outlook Web Access provides access to a user's mailbox from any browser that supports HTML 3.2 and European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) formats. It is an ideal client for users who do not have access to Outlook, such as users who are traveling or who rely on shared workstations for access to e-mail and calendar information.

This topic covers basic questions that you might have about Outlook Web Access, and includes links to additional information.

## Browser Requirements for Outlook Web Access

Outlook Web Access in Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 can be run in two formats: Outlook Web Access Premium and Outlook Web Access Light. Outlook Web Access Premium requires Internet Explorer 6 or later versions and has a rich feature set. Outlook Web Access Light works with most Web browsers, has fewer features than Outlook Web Access Premium, and performs better over slow connections.

## Outlook Web Access Premium

The following table describes the combinations of browsers and operating systems that you can use together with Outlook Web Access Premium.

### Versions of Web browsers and operating systems to use with Outlook Web Access Premium

| **Windows version** | **Supported browsers for Outlook Web Access Premium** |
| --- | --- |
| Windows Millennium Edition | Internet Explorer 6 and later versions |
| Windows 2000 Server | Internet Explorer 6 and later versions |
| Windows XP | Internet Explorer 6 and later versions |
| Windows Server 2003 | Internet Explorer 6 and later versions |
| Windows Vista | Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista |

## Outlook Web Access Light

Outlook Web Access Light is supported on many browsers that support HTML 3.2 and ECMA. The following table describes the combination of browsers and operating systems that you can use together with Outlook Web Access Light.

### Versions of Web browsers and operating systems to use with Outlook Web Access Light

| **Operating system** | **Internet Explorer version** | **Additional browsers** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows 98 | Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5, 6, and later versions | Not available |
| Windows Millennium Edition | Internet Explorer 5.5, 6, and later versions | Not available |
| Windows 2000 Server | Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5, 6, and later versions | Not available |
| Windows XP | Internet Explorer 6 and later versions | Mozilla Firefox 1.8, Opera 7.54 |
| Windows Server 2003 | Internet Explorer 6 and later versions | Mozilla Firefox 1.8, Opera 7.54 |
| Windows Vista | Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista | Mozilla Firefox 1.8, Opera 7.54 |
| Mac OS 9 | Internet Explorer 5.01 | Netscape Navigator 7.1 |
| Mac OS 10.3 | Not available | Safari 1.2 |
| Sun Solaris 9, x86 | Not available | Mozilla Firefox 1.8, Netscape Navigator 7.1 |
| Linux Red Hat Desktop (RHEL3) | Not available | Mozilla Firefox 1.8, Netscape Navigator 7.1 |
| HP/UX 11i | Not available | Mozilla Firefox 1.8, Netscape Navigator 7.1 |

Note

Outlook Web Access is not supported on Microsoft Pocket Internet Explorer.

## Effect of Virus Scanning on Outlook Web Access

There is an error message that users may receive in Microsoft Office Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server 2007 when an antivirus program changes a message in the Drafts folder.

## Resolving the Error

If a message in the Drafts folder in Outlook Web Access is scanned by an antivirus program and triggers a screening rule that causes the message to be modified, the user will receive a warning message when they open the message and try to modify it or send it.

To resolve this issue, instruct the user to save and close the message, and then reopen it and try again.

## For More Information

For more information about browsers that Outlook Web Access Light supports, see the following Web sites:

* Opera   [https://www.opera.com](https://www.opera.com/)
* Mozilla Firefox   <https://www.mozilla.com/firefox>
* Netscape Navigator   [https://browser.netscape.com](https://browser.netscape.com/)

#### FAQ for Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server Data Validation Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2008-2247

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in Outlook Web Access (OWA) for Exchange Server. Exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain access to an individual clientâs OWA session data allowing elevation of privilege. The attacker could then perform any action the user could perform from within OWA such as reading, sending, and deleting e-mail as the logged-on user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is a result of Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server not sufficiently validating e-mail fields when opening mail from within an individual clientâs OWA session.

**What is cross-site scripting?**

[Cross-site scripting](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/security/news/crssite.mspx) (XSS) is a security vulnerability that could enable an attacker to "inject" code into a user's session with a Web site. Unlike most security vulnerabilities, XSS does not apply to any single vendor's products-instead, it can affect any software that generates HTML and that does not follow defensive programming practices.

**How does cross-site scripting work?**

Web pages contain text and HTML markup. Text and HTML markup are generated by the server and are interpreted by the client. Servers that generate static pages have full control over the way that the client interprets the pages that the server sends. However, servers that generate dynamic pages do not have control over the way that the client interprets the serverâs output. If untrusted content is introduced into a dynamic page, neither the server nor the client has sufficient information to recognize that this action has occurred and to take protective measures.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to open a specially crafted e-mail message via an individual clientâs OWA session. The message could then cause malicious script to run on the individual clientâs system in the context of the userâs OWA session.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker could use this vulnerability in Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server to run malicious script on an individual userâs system in the context of the userâs OWA session. The attacker could then perform OWA actions as the logged-on user, such as reading, sending, or deleting e-mail as the logged-on user.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Outlook Web Access (OWA) for Exchange Server is installed are the systems where the attack can occur. However, individual OWA clients connecting to the Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server are primarily at risk for elevation of privilege.

**What does the update do?**

This update addresses the vulnerability by sufficiently validating e-mail fields when opening mails from within OWA.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. This security bulletin addresses the privately disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

## Security Update Deployment

**Affected Software**

For information about the specific security update for your affected software, click the appropriate link:

#### Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 (all editions)

**Reference Table**

The following table contains the security update information for this software. You can find additional information in the subsection, **Deployment Information**, in this section.

| **Inclusion in Future Service Packs** | The update for this issue may be included in a future update rollup |
| --- | --- |
| **Deployment** |  |
| Installing without user intervention | Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 2:\ Exchange2003-kb950159-x86-enu /quiet |
| Installing without restarting | Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 2:\ Exchange2003-kb950159-x86-enu /norestart |
| Update log file | kb950159.log |
| Further information | See the subsection, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance** |
| **Restart Requirement** |  |
| Restart required? | No, this update does not require a restart. The installer stops the required services, applies the update, and then restarts the services. However, if the required services cannot be stopped for any reason, or if required files are being used, this update will require a restart. If this behavior occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart. To help reduce the chance that a restart will be required, stop all affected services and close all applications that may use the affected files prior to installing the security update. For more information about the reasons why you may be prompted to restart your computer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 887012](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/887012). |

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft Exchange hotfix.

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Removing the Update**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.
