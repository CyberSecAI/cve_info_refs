Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2008-2327:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an improper handling of LZW-encoded TIFF images within the `libtiff` library's LZW decoder. Specifically, the translation table used by the decoding algorithm is not correctly reinitialized after a "code clear" code is read from the stream being decoded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use of uninitialized memory:** When the decoder encounters a "code clear" code, it should discard the previous translation table and start filling it again. However, if the table is not re-zeroed, the decoder may index into invalid or uninitialized parts of the table during subsequent processing, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Buffer Underflow:** The uninitialized data in the table being used can lead to a buffer underflow in the decoder when it tries to access a code that points to an invalid memory location. This was also described as a "buffer underflow" in Gentoo's bug report and "uninitialized data" in RedHat's bug report.
*   **Double CODE_CLEAR:** Another vulnerability is triggered when two subsequent CODE_CLEAR codes are read.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Crash/Application Termination:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to application crashes due to invalid memory accesses.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The uninitialized table access and subsequent pointer dereferences can corrupt memory, potentially leading to further issues.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious TIFF Files:** The primary attack vector is through crafted TIFF image files containing LZW-encoded data that triggers the vulnerability in the libtiff decoder.
*   **User Interaction:** An attacker would need to entice a user or automated system to open or process a crafted TIFF file. This could be achieved via malicious websites, email attachments, or other file transfer methods.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to create a crafted TIFF file:** The attacker needs to create or modify a TIFF image file so that the LZW-encoded data will cause the vulnerability to be triggered.
*   **Ability to deliver the malicious file:** The attacker needs to find a way to deliver the malicious TIFF file to a target system and trick the target into processing it with an application using the vulnerable libtiff library.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Apple Product Security:** Drew Yao from Apple Product Security initially reported this issue.
*   **Upstream Bugzilla:** There was an upstream bug report regarding the double CODE_CLEAR issue (<http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1929>), which was then combined with this CVE in some distros.
*  **Embargo:** Initially there was an embargo on the publication of the vulnerability details.
*   **Patch:** A proposed patch was developed by Drew Yao that addresses the issue by re-zeroing the translation table after a CODE_CLEAR code.
*  **Affected Versions:** libtiff versions prior to 3.8.2-r4 (Gentoo) and 3.8.2-7ubuntu3.1 (Ubuntu 8.04) are known to be affected.
*   **Affected Applications**: Multiple applications using libtiff library to process tiff images are vulnerable. This includes image viewers, browsers, editors.
*   **Red Hat Errata:** Red Hat issued multiple errata to address the vulnerability in various products.
*  **Gentoo GLSA:** Gentoo issued a GLSA to provide a fix for the vulnerability.
*  **Multiple Fixes:** The fixes involved zeroing out the string table after CODE_CLEAR code to prevent use of uninitialized data. There are also fixes that prevent double CODE_CLEAR from crashing the decoder.
* **Affected Architectures** All architectures are vulnerable.
* **kfax**: An embedded copy of libtiff was found in kdegraphics / kfax as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3. kfax was determined not to use the vulnerable part of libtiff due to file format checks.

In summary, CVE-2008-2327 is a vulnerability in the libtiff library that arises from improper handling of LZW-compressed data, leading to potential memory corruption, crashes, and possibly arbitrary code execution. It can be exploited by crafting malicious TIFF images and enticing users to open them.
