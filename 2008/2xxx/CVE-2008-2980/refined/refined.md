{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization and validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to system access, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code, read sensitive files, or perform other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable scripts",
       "Manipulating parameters such as 'thumb_template' and 'language' to include malicious files",
    "Injecting malicious scripts into parameters like 'error_meldung' and 'ueberschrift' for XSS attacks"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server, and knowledge of the vulnerable parameters is required. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to perform the attack."
