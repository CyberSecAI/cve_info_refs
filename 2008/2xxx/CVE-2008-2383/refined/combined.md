1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- boinc-client
The boinc-client was missing return value checks for openssl function
calls. (CVE-2009-0126)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1

bugs. (CVE-2008-2960, CVE-2008-3197, CVE-2008-1149, CVE-2008-1567,
CVE-2008-1924, CVE-2008-4096, CVE-2008-4326, CVE-2008-5621, CVE-2008-5622)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- libnasl
This update of libnasl adds missing return value checks for openssl
function calls. (CVE-2009-0125)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- moodle
Insufficient quoting of wiki page titles allowed attackers to
conduct cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2008-5432)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- net-snmp
Remote attackers could crash net-snmp via GETBULK-Request
(CVE-2008-4309).
In addition the following non-security issues have been fixed:
- typo in error message
- make OIDs longer than 256 chars work
- typo in the snmpd init script to really load all agents
- logrotate config to restart the snmptrapd as well
Affected products: SLES9, NLD9, SLES10, SLED 10
- audiofile
A heap-overflow in libaudiofile was fixed. The overflow existsed
in the WAV processing code and can be exploited to execute arbi-
trary code. (CVE-2008-5824)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, OES, SLES9, NLD9, SLES 10,
SLED10
- XFree86/xterm
XTerm evaluated various ANSI Escape sequences so that command
execution was possible if an attacker could pipe raw data to an
xterm. (CVE-2008-2383)
(It is usually not recommended to display raw data on an xterm.)
Support for Matrox G200EV/G200WB cards was added.
Affected products: OES, SLES9, NLD9
- amarok
This update of amarok fixes several integer overflows and unchecked
memory allocations that can be exploited by malformed Audible digital

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1694-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Florian Weimer
January 02, 2009                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : xterm
Vulnerability  : design flaw
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-2383
Debian Bug     : 510030

Paul Szabo discovered that xterm, a terminal emulator for the X Window
System, places arbitrary characters into the input buffer when
displaying certain crafted escape sequences (CVE-2008-2383).

As an additional precaution, this security update also disables font
changing, user-defined keys, and X property changes through escape
sequences.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 222-1etch3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your xterm package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-3746647cc3
2023-07-27 02:04:37.484924
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : kitty
Product : Fedora 37
Version : 0.26.5
Release : 6.fc37
URL : <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty>
Summary : Cross-platform, fast, feature full, GPU based terminal emulator
Description :
- Offloads rendering to the GPU for lower system load and buttery smooth
scrolling. Uses threaded rendering to minimize input latency.

- Supports all modern terminal features: graphics (images), unicode, true-color,
OpenType ligatures, mouse protocol, focus tracking, bracketed paste and
several new terminal protocol extensions.

- Supports tiling multiple terminal windows side by side in different layouts
without needing to use an extra program like tmux.

- Can be controlled from scripts or the shell prompt, even over SSH.

- Has a framework for Kittens, small terminal programs that can be used to
extend kitty's functionality. For example, they are used for Unicode input,
Hints and Side-by-side diff.

- Supports startup sessions which allow you to specify the window/tab layout,
working directories and programs to run on startup.

- Cross-platform: kitty works on Linux and macOS, but because it uses only
OpenGL for rendering, it should be trivial to port to other Unix-like
platforms.

- Allows you to open the scrollback buffer in a separate window using arbitrary
programs of your choice. This is useful for browsing the history comfortably
in a pager or editor.

- Has multiple copy/paste buffers, like vim.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- imlib2
A security problem was fixed in imlib2 where loading a specific XPM
file could corrupt memory. (CVE-2008-5187)
Affected products: SLED 10 SP2, SLE SDK 10 (updates for other products
were already released)
- valgrind
valgrind reads a file .valgrindrc in the current directory.
Therefore local users could place such a file a world writable
directory such as /tmp and influence other users' valgrind when it's
executed there (CVE-2008-4865).
Affected products: SLES9/SDK (updates for other products were already
released)
- kvm
Rogue VNC clients could make the built in VNC server of kvm run into
an infinite loop (CVE-2008-2382)
An off-by-one bug limited the length of VNC passwords to seven
instead of eight (CVE-2008-5714)
Virtualized guests could potentially execute code on the host by
triggering a buffer overflow in the network emulation code via large
ethernet frames (CVE-2007-5729)
Virtualized guests could potentially execute code on the host by
triggering a heap based buffer overflow in the Cirrus Graphics card
emulation (CVE-2007-1320).
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- cups
Previous updates for the PNG and HPGL filters were incomplete and
are corrected now (CVE-2008-3641, CVE-2008-5286).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3, 11.0, SLE10-SP2, SLES9
- lynx
This update of lynx fixes two security bugs:
- untrusted search path allows execution of arbitrary commands via
.mailcap or mime.types file (CVE-2006-7234)
- when advanced mode is enabled and lynx is used as URL handler, remote
attackers can execute arbitrary commands (CVE-2008-4690)
Affected products: NLD 9 SDK, SLE SDK 10 SP2, SLES SDK 9 (updates for
other products were already released)
- xterm
XTerm evaluated various ANSI Escape sequences so that command execution
was possible if an attacker could pipe raw data to an xterm.
(CVE-2008-2383)
(It is usually not recommended to display raw data on an xterm.)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLE10-SP2, (SLES9 packages will
be released within this week)

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

```
```
Package: xterm
Version: 222-1etch2
Severity: grave
Tags: security patch
Justification: user security hole

DECRQSS Device Control Request Status String "DCS $ q" simply echoes
(responds with) invalid commands. For example,
perl -e 'print "\eP\$q\nbad-command\n\e\\"'
would run bad-command.

Exploitability is the same as for the "window title reporting" issue
in DSA-380: include the DCS string in an email message to the victim,
or arrange to have it in syslog to be viewed by root.

The attached patch should fix the problem.

---

The default allowWindowOps is false (as should be), but the man page
says the default is true. The man page should also mention that turning
it on is a security risk, to avoid regression e.g. as per
<http://bugs.debian.org/384593>
<http://www.debian.org/security/2003/dsa-380>
and also the much older
<http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/psz/securedu.html#xterm>
(and private message to xterm maintainers on 9 Mar 2000, seems only
"grep PSz main.c" remains).

---

Ubuntu still allows window title reporting, and is vulnerable to
perl -e 'print "\e\]0;;bad-command;\a\e\[21t"'

---

I wonder whether the following are handled and/or dangerous:
set X property	perl -e 'print "\e\]3;XTerm.vt100.allowWindowOps=1\e\\"'
set, get font   perl -e 'print "\e\]50;bad-command\e\\","\e\]50;?\e\\"'
UDK setting	perl -e 'print "\eP1;1|17/0a6261642d636f6d6d616e640a\e\\"'
  then trick user to press F key, or
		perl -e 'print "\eP+q584b5f434f4c524f53\e\\"'

Thanks for reporting this.

The sid version is also affected because allowWindowOps is not set to
false in the configuration.

I plan to fix this for etch by disabling UDKs, font shifting, X
property changes, and applying Paul's patch.  Any objections?

well, yes - Szabo's patch "works", but is incorrect.

For the rest - Matthieu Herrb forwarded Weimer's proposed patch,
which also needs work.

(coincidentally, I'd intended working on xterm today or tomorrow -
looks like I have extra to-do items)

bye.

> whether this is ok for testing-security.

If I read the patch correctly, you change the compiled-in defaults.
This is fine, but is somewhat different from allowWindowOps approach
in etch (which shipped a configuration file).  etch -> lenny updates
should work as well and result in a conservative configuration choice.

For reference, I've attached the patch I plan to apply to the etch4
version, to reintroduce font shifting support for those who need it.
If you think we need to backport more changes in #238, I'm open to
that, too.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-a004ecb3f8
2023-07-26 00:35:00.941701
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : kitty
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 0.29.1
Release : 1.fc38
URL : <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty>
Summary : Cross-platform, fast, feature full, GPU based terminal emulator
Description :
- Offloads rendering to the GPU for lower system load and buttery smooth
scrolling. Uses threaded rendering to minimize input latency.

- Supports all modern terminal features: graphics (images), unicode, true-color,
OpenType ligatures, mouse protocol, focus tracking, bracketed paste and
several new terminal protocol extensions.

- Supports tiling multiple terminal windows side by side in different layouts
without needing to use an extra program like tmux.

- Can be controlled from scripts or the shell prompt, even over SSH.

- Has a framework for Kittens, small terminal programs that can be used to
extend kitty's functionality. For example, they are used for Unicode input,
Hints and Side-by-side diff.

- Supports startup sessions which allow you to specify the window/tab layout,
working directories and programs to run on startup.

- Cross-platform: kitty works on Linux and macOS, but because it uses only
OpenGL for rendering, it should be trivial to port to other Unix-like
platforms.

- Allows you to open the scrollback buffer in a separate window using arbitrary
programs of your choice. This is useful for browsing the history comfortably
in a pager or editor.

- Has multiple copy/paste buffers, like vim.

#### Security Update 2009-002 / Mac OS X v10.5.7

* **Apache**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-2939

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11

  Impact: Visiting a malicious website via a proxy may result in cross-site scripting

  Description: An input validation issue exists in Apache's handling of FTP proxy requests containing wildcard characters. Visiting a malicious website via an Apache proxy may result in a cross-site scripting attack. This update addresses the issue by applying the Apache patch for version 2.0.63. Further information is available via the Apache web site at <http://httpd.apache.org/> Apache 2.0.x is only shipped with Mac OS X Server v10.4.x systems. Mac OS X v10.5.x and Mac OS X Server v10.5.x ship with Apache 2.2.x.

* **Apache**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-2939

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Visiting a malicious website via a proxy may result in cross-site scripting

  Description: An input validation issue exists in Apache 2.2.9's handling of FTP proxy requests containing wildcard characters. Visiting a malicious website via an Apache proxy may result in a cross-site scripting attack. This update addresses the issue by updating Apache to version 2.2.11. Further information is available via the Apache web site at <http://httpd.apache.org/>

* **Apache**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-0456

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Web sites that allow users to control the name of a served file may be vulnerable to HTTP response injection

  Description: A request forgery issue exists in Apache. Apache does not escape filenames when negotiating the correct content type to send to a remote browser. A user who can publish files with specially crafted names to a web site can substitute their own response for any web page hosted on the system. This update addresses the issue by escaping filenames in content negotiation responses.

* **ATS**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0154

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded CFF font may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in Apple Type Services' handling of Compact Font Format (CFF) fonts. Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded CFF font may lead to arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. Credit to Charlie Miller of Independent Security Evaluators working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative for reporting this issue.

* **BIND**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0025

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: BIND is susceptible to a spoofing attack if configured to use DNSSEC

  Description: BIND incorrectly checks the return value of the OpenSSL DSA\_do\_verify function. On systems using the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) protocol, a maliciously crafted DSA certificate could bypass the validation, which may lead to a spoofing attack. By default, DNSSEC is not enabled. This update addresses the issue by updating BIND to version 9.3.6-P1 on Mac OS X v10.4, and version 9.4.3-P1 for Mac OS X v10.5 systems. Further information is available via the ISC web site at <https://www.isc.org/>

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0144

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Applications that use CFNetwork may send secure cookies in unencrypted HTTP requests

  Description: An implementation issue exists in CFNetwork's parsing of Set-Cookie headers, which may result in certain cookies being unexpectedly sent over a non-encrypted connection. This issue affects non-RFC compliant Set-Cookie headers that are accepted for compatibility reasons. This may result in applications that use CFNetwork, such as Safari, sending sensitive information in unencrypted HTTP requests. This update addresses the issue through improved parsing of Set-Cookie headers. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5. Credit to Andrew Mortensen of the University of Michigan for reporting this issue.

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0157

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Visiting a malicious website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in the handling of overly long HTTP headers in CFNetwork. Visiting a malicious website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue by performing additional validation of HTTP headers. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5. Credit to Moritz Jodeit of n.runs AG for reporting this issue.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0145
