Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2338

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure cookie handling in ActiveKB. The application creates a cookie to track admin authentication status, but the cookie only contains a "true" value. It does not validate the cookie or user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application uses a simple cookie value ("true") to determine admin status, making it easily forgeable.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Due to the insecure cookie, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Admin Access:** An attacker can gain administrative access to the application by setting a forged cookie, without needing to authenticate with legitimate admin credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted Cookie:** An attacker crafts a cookie with the value "auth=true".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to set a cookie in the victim's browser, usually done via JavaScript execution.
*   No prior authentication or network position seems to be required.

**Technical Details:**
* The application uses the `auth` cookie.
* The cookie is checked, if it equals true the system gives administrative access.

**Exploit:**
The provided JavaScript code `javascript:document.cookie = "auth=true; path=/";` sets the necessary cookie to bypass the application's authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit is simple to execute through JavaScript.
* The vendor was not notified by the time the exploit was released.
