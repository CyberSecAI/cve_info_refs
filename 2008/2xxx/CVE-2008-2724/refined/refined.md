      "cve": "CVE-2008-2724",
      "is_related": true,
      "details": "Gallery 2.2.5 addresses multiple security vulnerabilities:\n\n*   **XSS through host and path component of request URL**: The complete request URL is now properly sanitized. This vulnerability affects all modules.\n*   **Information disclosure in album-select module**: Fixed exposure of album titles through the album-select module when a guest would add a new album to a hidden album.\n*   **Permission escalation through zip archive extraction**: No longer creating sub-albums when adding items from a zip archive if the active user does not have the necessary permission to do so.\n*  **Information disclosure through embed.php**: `embed.php` is no longer susceptible to spoofing the remote address and thus no longer discloses the local filesystem path of the Gallery 2 installation folder.\n*  **View permissions not enforced for password protected items**: No longer offering the option to protect non-album items directly and only offering the feature for albums since full protection only applies to the items within the album.\n",
      "root_cause": "Inadequate input sanitization and permission checks, and information disclosure via vulnerable scripts.",
       "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Information Disclosure",
        "Permission Escalation",
        "Inadequate Access Control"
      ],
      "impact": "XSS can lead to malicious script execution in user's browser, potentially stealing credentials or performing actions on their behalf. Information disclosure can expose sensitive information such as file paths and hidden album titles. Permission escalation allows unauthorized creation of albums. Lack of permission enforcement allows unauthorized access to protected content.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious crafted request URLs (XSS)",
        "Abuse of album-select module",
         "Uploading a malicious zip archive",
        "Spoofing remote addresses via embed.php",
         "Accessing password-protected non-album items directly"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests or manipulate inputs via the web interface. For the zip archive issue, the attacker would need to be able to upload a malicious zip archive, and for the permission issue, have access to password protected content."
