Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2462:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The "viewfile" command in Caucho Resin's documentation has a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `file` parameter of the `viewfile` command is vulnerable to XSS, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary script execution:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the Resin web pages. This could lead to various attacks, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Stealing sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attack can be carried out remotely by sending a specially crafted request with malicious script code in the `file` parameter to the vulnerable `viewfile` command.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Resin server.
*   The attacker does not need to have prior access or credentials to the Resin server.
*   The attacker must target a system that has Resin documentation enabled on the webserver.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Tomasz Kuczynski.
*   The issue is resolved in Resin versions 3.0.25 and 3.1.4.
*   The vendor (Caucho Technology) recommends not including the Resin documentation on production web servers to avoid exposing the vulnerable command.
