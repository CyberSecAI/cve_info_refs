{
  "CVE-2008-2076": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to local file inclusion due to insufficient input sanitization in the `style` parameter within the `admin.php` file.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server, potentially revealing sensitive information or executing malicious code if the included file contains PHP code or if combined with other vulnerabilities.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `admin.php` script including a malicious value for the style parameter, e.g., `admin.php?style=../../[FILE NAME]%00&language=ircrash`",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and the application must be accessible."
