Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2064:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A programming error in the interface (API) connecting phpGedView with external programs like content management systems. This was a fundamental design flaw.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The vulnerability allowed for remote privilege escalation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers could gain administrator privileges on the phpGedView application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack. The vulnerability existed within the application's API meant to connect to external programs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  Attackers required remote access to the phpGedView instance and the ability to interact with the vulnerable API.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involved removing the vulnerable API entirely, rather than patching it. This is because the flaw was a fundamental design issue. A redesigned API was available in a later version of phpGedView.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA) also noted that these API interfaces were likely not used by the majority of users, which contributed to the decision to remove it.
