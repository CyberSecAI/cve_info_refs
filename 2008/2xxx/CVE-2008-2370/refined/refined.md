{
  "CVE-2008-2370": {
    "Description": "When using a RequestDispatcher the target path was normalised before the query string was removed. A request that included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to access content that would otherwise be protected by a security constraint or by locating it in under the WEB-INF directory.",
    "Root cause": "The target path normalization was performed before removing the query string.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect path normalization",
      "Improper access control"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure, bypassing security constraints, and access to protected resources.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "HTTP request with a specially crafted request parameter"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application"
  }
}
