Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2050:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
The provided content clearly identifies CVE-2008-2050 as a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the FastCGI SAPI of PHP. This is consistent with the official CVE description.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a **stack-based buffer overflow** within the FastCGI SAPI implementation in PHP.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Stack-based buffer overflow**: This type of vulnerability arises when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer space on the stack.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - Exploitation can lead to a **denial of service (DoS)** by crashing the application or even potentially allow for **arbitrary code execution** on the server.

**5. Attack vectors:**
    - The specific attack vectors are not explicitly detailed in the provided content, and are noted as "unknown attack vectors."

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker would need the ability to send crafted requests to the vulnerable FastCGI SAPI. Given it's a network facing API, it is likely to be a remote exploit.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

The core vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the FastCGI SAPI within PHP. This is caused by improper handling of input data which leads to data being written beyond buffer limits on the stack. Exploitation could lead to a denial of service or potentially remote code execution, although specifics regarding the attack vector are not known. The vulnerability affects the `fastcgi.c` file.
