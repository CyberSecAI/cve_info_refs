Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2907:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an authentication bypass and lack of proper input sanitization in the WebChamado application, specifically in the user creation process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The exploit leverages a flaw in the login mechanism that allows bypassing authentication by injecting a crafted string in the `eml` parameter. The `eml=\') or 1=1/*&pas=masteradm&btn=Enviar` bypasses the login and gives access as admin.
*   **Arbitrary User Creation:** After bypassing the login, the exploit can create a new administrator user. The application does not properly validate user creation parameters, allowing the attacker to set administrative privileges during user creation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Full system compromise:** The attacker can gain administrative access to the WebChamado application, leading to full control over the application and potentially the server.
*   **Data breaches and manipulation:** With administrative control, the attacker can access, modify, and delete sensitive information stored in the application database.
*   **Service disruption:** The attacker can potentially disrupt the normal operations of the application, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP Requests:** The exploit uses HTTP POST requests to bypass login and then create a new administrator account.
*   **Network-based Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable WebChamado application.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests, specifically POST requests and how to craft form data.
*   **Scripting/programming skills:** The exploit is written in Perl, and the attacker needs the ability to run this script to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The exploit script uses LWP::UserAgent to send HTTP requests.
*   The exploit targets WebChamado version 1.1.
*   The exploit also relies on the `magic_quotes_gpc` PHP setting being set to off
*   The exploit adds a user with admin privileges to the system and this new user will receive password details in email.
