```
Root cause of vulnerability:
- NetBSD fails to properly handle ICMPv6 MLD query packets with a Maximum-Response-Delay field set to less than 0x0010.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Division by zero vulnerability in the NetBSD kernel when processing the malformed ICMPv6 MLD packet.

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a NetBSD system to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a malformed ICMPv6 MLD-QUERY packet with a Maximum-Response-Delay field set to the value of less than 0x0010.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Attacker must be on a local link to send the malformed packet.
