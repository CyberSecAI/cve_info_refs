Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how WordPress determines the current page (`$pagenow`) in the `wp-includes/vars.php` file. The original code used the `$PHP_SELF` variable, which is derived from user-controlled input (`$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` and `$_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]`), to determine the current page. This made it possible for an attacker to manipulate the `$pagenow` variable by crafting a specific URL, bypassing access controls based on `$pagenow`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure use of `$PHP_SELF`:** The code directly uses `$PHP_SELF` to determine the current page without proper sanitization. This allows for manipulation via `PATH_INFO`.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code failed to validate or sanitize the `$PHP_SELF` variable, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary values, leading to incorrect `$pagenow` assignments.
- **Bypassed access control:** Access to administrative pages is controlled based on `$pagenow`. Manipulating it allows unprivileged users to access administrative functionality that they are not supposed to access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating `$pagenow`, unprivileged users could perform actions reserved for administrators such as switching themes and deactivating or activating plugins, effectively escalating their privileges.
- **Website Defacement:** Since themes could be switched, an attacker could deface the website
- **Site takeover:** Since plugins could be activated or deactivated, an attacker could potentially take over the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct URL manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through crafting malicious URLs that include `/index.php` or other admin-page filenames after valid admin page names, exploiting the way `$PHP_SELF` is processed.
    - For example, accessing `/wp-admin/themes.php/index.php` would cause WordPress to see `index.php` as the current page, even though the user is actually accessing `themes.php`, allowing access to functionality usually restricted to higher-level user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Basic WordPress User:** The attacker only needs to have a basic user account (e.g. subscriber) on the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site to send HTTP requests containing the malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided changeset (`6029`) shows the fix which adds sanitization by first checking if the user is in the admin panel using `is_admin()`. Then it will use a regex to extract the page name. If the user is not in the admin panel, a similar approach is used but with different regexes.
- The fix addresses the issue of `$pagenow` determination by introducing more robust checks and sanitization of the `$PHP_SELF` variable. It also ensures that the `index.php` page is correctly handled.
- A patch was also created for WordPress 2.0 branch and is available in the provided content
- The vulnerability was initially discovered by "xknown" and fixed by "markjaquith".
