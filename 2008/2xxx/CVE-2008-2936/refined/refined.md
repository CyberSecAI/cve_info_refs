Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-2936:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Postfix incorrectly checks the ownership of a mailbox before delivering mail.
- It allows delivery to root-owned symlinks in an insecure manner.
- On systems that allow hardlinking of symlinks (contrary to POSIX.1-2001), a local attacker can exploit this behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insecure Handling of Symlinks:** Postfix allows mail delivery to root-owned symlinks, which is intended for compatibility with systems using symlinks in /dev (like Solaris). However, this creates an attack vector if symlinks can be hardlinked.
-   **Missing Ownership Verification:** Postfix delivery agents do not properly verify the ownership of a mailbox before delivering mail.
-   **Hardlink Creation:** The ability to create hardlinks to symlinks allows attackers to bypass Postfixâ€™s normal restrictions on delivery to symlinks.
-   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can use a hardlinked symlink to overwrite arbitrary files, bypassing ownership restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files with content from an email, including system files like /etc/passwd. This can lead to gaining root privileges.
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** The vulnerability allows a local attacker to append mail data to an arbitrary file.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
- **Hardlink Manipulation:** An attacker creates a hardlink to a root-owned symlink, pointing it to a file they wish to overwrite.
- **Email Injection:** The attacker sends an email to a user account configured in such a way that the email is written via the hardlinked symlink, thus writing to the target file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the system.
- **Write Access to Spool Directory:** The attacker typically needs write permissions to the mail spool directory (e.g., /var/spool/mail). Note that on Gentoo, this is not the default configuration.
- **Ability to Create Hardlinks:** The attacker needs the ability to create hardlinks to root-owned symlinks in directories outside of the spool directory.
- **Vulnerable Postfix Configuration:** The system must use a mailbox delivery style with the built-in local(8) or virtual(8) delivery agents. Maildir style configurations are not affected.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

-   The vulnerability is triggered when Postfix attempts to deliver mail to a symlink, which it does under certain conditions.
-   The exploit involves creating a hard link to a root-owned symlink to bypass ownership checks and force the mail delivery to overwrite the target file.
-   The Gentoo security advisory notes that the default configuration on Gentoo Linux does not permit privilege escalation due to the default mail spool directory permissions.
-   The advisory provides several workarounds, including making the mail spool directory non-writable by users, preventing hardlinks outside the mail spool directory, and using a different delivery agent.
-   Several vendors were affected, including Gentoo, Mandriva, SUSE, and Ubuntu.
-   An exploit script is provided in one of the documents demonstrating the attack methodology, including the creation of a hardlink, a symlink to the target file, and sending an email.
-   The vulnerability is present in Postfix versions prior to 2.5.3-r1 (Gentoo), 2.3.8-2etch1 (Debian), etc.
