# Postfix: Local privilege escalation vulnerability — GLSA **200808-12**

Postfix incorrectly checks the ownership of a mailbox, allowing, in certain
circumstances, to append data to arbitrary files on a local system with
root privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-mta/postfix** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.4.7-r1**>= **2.5.3-r1**revision >= **2.4.8**>= **2.4.9** |

### Background

Postfix is Wietse Venema's mailer that attempts to be fast, easy to
administer, and secure, as an alternative to the widely-used Sendmail
program.

### Description

Sebastian Krahmer of SuSE has found that Postfix allows to deliver mail
to root-owned symlinks in an insecure manner under certain conditions.
Normally, Postfix does not deliver mail to symlinks, except to
root-owned symlinks, for compatibility with the systems using symlinks
in /dev like Solaris. Furthermore, some systems like Linux allow to
hardlink a symlink, while the POSIX.1-2001 standard requires that the
symlink is followed. Depending on the write permissions and the
delivery agent being used, this can lead to an arbitrary local file
overwriting vulnerability (CVE-2008-2936). Furthermore, the Postfix
delivery agent does not properly verify the ownership of a mailbox
before delivering mail (CVE-2008-2937).

### Impact

The combination of these features allows a local attacker to hardlink a
root-owned symlink such that the newly created symlink would be
root-owned and would point to a regular file (or another symlink) that
would be written by the Postfix built-in local(8) or virtual(8)
delivery agents, regardless the ownership of the final destination
regular file. Depending on the write permissions of the spool mail
directory, the delivery style, and the existence of a root mailbox,
this could allow a local attacker to append a mail to an arbitrary file
like /etc/passwd in order to gain root privileges.

The default configuration of Gentoo Linux does not permit any kind of
user privilege escalation.

The second vulnerability (CVE-2008-2937) allows a local attacker,
already having write permissions to the mail spool directory which is
not the case on Gentoo by default, to create a previously nonexistent
mailbox before Postfix creates it, allowing to read the mail of another
user on the system.

### Workaround

The following conditions should be met in order to be vulnerable to
local privilege escalation.

* The mail delivery style is mailbox, with the Postfix built-in
  local(8) or virtual(8) delivery agents.
* The mail spool directory (/var/spool/mail) is user-writeable.
* The user can create hardlinks pointing to root-owned symlinks
  located in other directories.

Consequently, each one of the following workarounds is efficient.

* Verify that your /var/spool/mail directory is not writeable by a
  user. Normally on Gentoo, only the mail group has write access, and no
  end-user should be granted the mail group ownership.
* Prevent the local users from being able to create hardlinks
  pointing outside of the /var/spool/mail directory, e.g. with a
  dedicated partition.
* Use a non-builtin Postfix delivery agent, like procmail or
  maildrop.
* Use the maildir delivery style of Postfix ("home\_mailbox=Maildir/"
  for example).

Concerning the second vulnerability, check the write permissions of
/var/spool/mail, or check that every Unix account already has a
mailbox, by using Wietse Venema's Perl script available in the official
advisory.

### Resolution

All Postfix users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-mta/postfix-2.5.3-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Postfix local privilege escalation

#### Vulnerability Note VU#938323

Original Release Date: 2008-08-18 | Last Revised: 2008-08-19

---

### Overview

The Postfix MTA contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability.

### Description

| Postfix is an mail transport agent (MTA) that is used by several Unix-like operating systems. Symbolic links and hard links are types of files that reference other files. Unlike hard links, symbolic links can point to directories and use relative pathnames.  On some non-POSIX.1-2001 and X/Open XPG4v2 compliant systems, users can hardlink symlinks which are owned by the root user. Postfix allows root-owned symlinks to be used as a mail destination folder. A hard link to a Postfix root-owned symlink could point to a file that can be overwritten by Postfix, regardless of the permissions of the destination file. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local, authenticated attacker may be able to overwrite arbitrary files, possibly gaining elevated privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**See <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.mail.postfix.announce/110> for information about obtaining updated software. Users who do not compile Postfix from source should see the systems affected section below for a partial list of affected vendors. |
| --- |

| **Set mailbox permissions**Making the system mail spool directory root-owned may mitigate this vulnerability. See <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.mail.postfix.announce/110> for specific information about this and other workarounds. |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Postfix is a well known MTA.
During a source code audit the SuSE Security-Team discovered a local
privilege escalation bug (CVE-2008-2936) as well as a mailbox ownership
problem (CVE-2008-2937) in postfix.
The first bug allowed local users to execute arbitrary commands as root
while the second one allowed local users to read other users mail.
2) Solution or Work-Around
Please install the update package.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
After successfully installing the postfix update, execute the command
/etc/init.d/postfix restart
as root to restart the postfix system.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                          Thijs Kinkhorst

Package        : postfix
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-2936

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that Postfix, a mail transfer agent,
incorrectly checks the ownership of a mailbox. In some configurations,
this allows for appending data to arbitrary files as root.

The default Debian installation of Postfix is not affected. Only a
configuration meeting the following requirements is vulnerable:
 * The mail delivery style is mailbox, with the Postfix built-in
   local(8) or virtual(8) delivery agents.
 * The mail spool directory is user-writeable.
 * The user can create hardlinks pointing to root-owned symlinks
   located in other directories.

For a detailed treating of this issue, please refer to the upstream
author's announcement:
<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.mail.postfix.announce/110>

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.8-2etch1.

For the testing distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.2-2lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.5.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postfix package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
