- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The extension Frontend Filemanager (air_filemanager) fails to properly filter user input, leading to both Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of user input sanitization allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
    - Remote Code Execution: Insufficient file filtering allows the execution of arbitrary PHP script code.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - XSS: Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites.
    - Remote Code Execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited by sending malicious user input to the vulnerable extension.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers can be unauthenticated users who are able to submit input to the file manager extension.
