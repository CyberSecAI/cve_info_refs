Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-2714:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to how Opera handles "certain characters" in web page addresses. These characters cause the page address text to be misplaced.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary vulnerability is a web page address misrepresentation. The displayed address in the browser's address bar does not accurately reflect the actual location of the web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to mislead users about the website they are visiting, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other forms of social engineering.
- By misrepresenting the web page address, an attacker could make a malicious website appear to be a legitimate one, tricking users into providing sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit this by crafting web pages with specific characters in the URL that trigger the misrepresentation of the page address in the Opera browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host web pages or control the URLs of websites visited by the target user.
- The target user must be using a vulnerable version of Opera before 9.26 and visit a crafted website to be exploited.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is addressed in Opera version 9.50, as detailed in the openSUSE security announcement.
- The provided content also mentions two other related CVEs (CVE-2008-2715 and CVE-2008-2716) that were fixed in the same update.
