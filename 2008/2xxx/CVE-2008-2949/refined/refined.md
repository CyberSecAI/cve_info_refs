Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Microsoft Internet Explorer fails to properly restrict access to a document's frames. This allows scripts from one domain to access certain elements within frames from different domains, bypassing the intended cross-domain security restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Domain Scripting Issue:**  The core issue is a flaw in how Internet Explorer handles cross-domain security, specifically regarding access to frames (iframes) from different origins.
- **Access to Non-Domain Specific Elements:** Even though the cross-domain security model appears to prevent access to sensitive information like cookies,  it does not prevent access to elements such as the `onmousedown` event of a frame from a different origin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Keystroke Capturing:** By monitoring the `onmousedown` event on a frame from a different domain, an attacker can capture keystrokes from the parent document when a user is interacting with the web page.
- **Potential for Further Actions:** While the initial impact is keystroke capturing, the vulnerability may allow for other malicious actions by exploiting other non-domain-specific DOM components.
- **Content Modification:** The attacker can replace the content of a frame from a different domain with arbitrary content.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Crafted HTML Document:** An attacker can create a malicious HTML document (e.g., a website or HTML email) that includes an iframe pointing to a target domain. The exploit is triggered when a user views this document using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Host Malicious HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver a malicious HTML document to the victim (e.g., via a website, email, or other means).
- **Target User Using Vulnerable IE:** The victim must be using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer (specifically IE 6, 7 and 8 beta 1).

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was publicly disclosed by Eduardo Vela.
* Proof-of-concept code for the vulnerability is publicly available.
* Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet Zone is suggested as a workaround.
* The blog post by sirdarckcat.blogspot.com provides a technical analysis and proof of concept, demonstrating how to achieve cross-domain access to frames in IE 6 and 7 using Javascript.
* The vulnerability is also referred to as "ghost" due to its ability to capture keystrokes without the user's knowledge.
* The vulnerability is fixed in later versions of Internet Explorer.
* The CERT note VU#516627 provides a summary of the vulnerability.
* Although the content mentions IE8 beta 1, a later PS note in the blog mentions a version that works for IE8 and all versions of IE7, which is covered in a different blog post.
