    "description": "The Microsoft Office Snapshot Viewer ActiveX control contains a race condition, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to download arbitrary files to arbitrary locations.",
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the Microsoft Office Snapshot Viewer ActiveX control (snapview.ocx) when downloading files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Uncontrolled file download location",
       "ActiveX control vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can download arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on the victim's system. These files could contain malicious code that could be executed, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The downloaded file can be placed in sensitive locations such as the Windows Startup folder to achieve automatic execution upon user login.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Viewing a malicious HTML document (web page, HTML email, or email attachment)"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the victim to view a malicious HTML document, such as a web page, an HTML email, or an email attachment. The attacker does not require authentication.",
     "additional_information": "Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available and it has been actively exploited. The vulnerable ActiveX control can be disabled by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs: {F0E42D50-368C-11D0-AD81-00A0C90DC8D9}, {F0E42D60-368C-11D0-AD81-00A0C90DC8D9}, {F2175210-368C-11D0-AD81-00A0C90DC8D9}.  Upgrading Internet Explorer to version 7 or later can mitigate this vulnerability."
