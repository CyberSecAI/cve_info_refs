- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter passed via the GET request in `index.php`. Specifically, the code directly includes the `$id` variable in an SQL query without any form of input validation or sanitization.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - SQL Injection: The main vulnerability is an SQL injection due to the unsanitized user-supplied input in the `id` parameter being directly used in the SQL query.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Database compromise: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to complete database compromise, including the extraction of sensitive information like usernames and passwords.

- **Attack vectors**:
  - Remote: The attack is conducted remotely by crafting a malicious URL with a crafted SQL injection payload within the `id` parameter.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special positioning or privileges are required.

**Additional details**

- The provided exploit code shows how an attacker can use `UNION SELECT` to extract user credentials from the `pages_t_users` table.
- The exploit suggests that usernames and passwords are not encrypted in the database.
