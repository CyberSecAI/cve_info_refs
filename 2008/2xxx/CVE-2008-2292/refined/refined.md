{
  "CVE-2008-2292": {
    "Description": "A buffer overflow in the __snprint_value function in snmp_get, potentially allowing execution of arbitrary code via a large OCTETSTRING in an attribute value pair (AVP).",
    "Root cause": "Buffer overflow in the __snprint_value function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a large OCTETSTRING in an attribute value pair (AVP) to the vulnerable function."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Remote attacker able to send crafted SNMP packets."
