```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to local file inclusion due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'section' parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include local files on the server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution by including a previously uploaded malicious image (shell).",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'section' parameter in the URL. Example: http://example.de/path/?section=../path/to/image%00",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable application and the ability to upload a file (image). The attacker also needs to know the path to the uploaded file."
