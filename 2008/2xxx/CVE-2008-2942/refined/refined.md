Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-2942:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `applydiff()` function within the `mercurial/patch.py` file of the Mercurial SCM. Specifically, the function did not properly validate paths within git patches when performing file renames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue. By crafting a malicious patch with relative paths (e.g., `../outside/foo`), an attacker could specify files outside the intended repository directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Renaming:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to rename arbitrary files on the system. This could potentially lead to data loss or system compromise.
- **Privilege Escalation (Potentially):** While not explicitly stated, the possibility of a user with sufficient privileges renaming sensitive system files cannot be ruled out.  This could lead to privilege escalation scenarios if done carefully.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Patch Import:** The primary attack vector is through importing a specially crafted patch.  This patch could be delivered via email or any channel where a user might be tempted to import patches.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Patch Creation:** An attacker must be able to create a malicious Mercurial patch containing directory traversal sequences in file rename operations.
- **Social Engineering or Compromise:** The attacker needs a way to entice or trick the target user into importing the crafted malicious patch into the Mercurial repository.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- **Patch Details:** The upstream patch (87c704ac92d4) introduces checks to ensure that the source and destination paths of renamed files are within the current working directory, preventing traversal. This was achieved by using `util.canonpath` to resolve relative paths.
- **Limited Attack Scenarios:**  The attack scenarios are considered somewhat limited. As noted in one of the mailing list excerpts,  it requires a user to "blindly" import patches from untrusted sources.
- **Fix:** The fix was to use `util.canonpath` to canonicalize the oldpath and newpath of renamed files in `mercurial/patch.py`.
- **Gentoo Security Advisory:**  Gentoo's security advisory (GLSA 200807-09) provides additional context, explicitly stating the impact as "renaming of arbitrary files, even outside the repository." It also indicates the vulnerability was discovered by Jakub Wilk.

In summary, CVE-2008-2942 describes a directory traversal vulnerability in Mercurial that could be exploited to rename files outside the repository through a crafted patch. The vulnerability is triggered during patch application and was fixed by ensuring paths were correctly canonized.
