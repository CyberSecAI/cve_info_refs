Hi

Moving this to oss-sec, since it is unembargoed.

It is possible to touch files outside root with a maliciously crafted
patch.

Upstream patch:

# Mercurial: Directory traversal — GLSA **200807-09**

A directory traversal vulnerability in Mercurial allows for the renaming of
arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-util/mercurial** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1-r2** |

### Background

Mercurial is a distributed Source Control Management system.

### Description

Jakub Wilk discovered a directory traversal vulnerabilty in the
applydiff() function in the mercurial/patch.py file.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to import a specially crafted
patch, possibly resulting in the renaming of arbitrary files, even
outside the repository.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mercurial users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/mercurial-1.0.1-r2"
```

SUSE Security Summary Report
Announcement ID: SUSE-SR:2008:015
Date: Fri, 18 Jul 2008 13:00:00 +0000
Cross-References: CVE-2008-1502, CVE-2008-2713, CVE-2008-2942
CVE-2008-2950, CVE-2008-3187
Content of this advisory:
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities:
- moodle cross site scripting problem
- clamav 0.93.3 release
- zypper repository signature checking and addition
- mercurial input validation
- poppler code execution problem
2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds:
None listed this week.
3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- moodle cross site scripting problem
An incorrect input validation in moodle could be exploited by
attackers to conduct cross site scripting attacks (CVE-2008-1502).
moodle is contained in and was fixed for openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- clamav 0.93.3 release
The Opensource AV scanner clamav was brought to version 0.93.3.
The changelog lists CVE-2008-2713 as fixed, which was fixed in
0.93.1 already, and had minor additional fixes to it in 0.93.3.
The update contains otherwise just stability and bugfixes.
clamav was updated on all distributions containing clamav.
- zypper repository signature checking and addition
The zypp-refresh-patches wrapper in used by various online updater
applets in openSUSE to check for new updates accepted new repository
keys without asking the user, so parsing potentially corrupted repositories.
It did not import those keys into the trusted keyring, leaving only the
repository XML parsing endangered. Please note that this wrapper only
checks repositories, it does not do any package operations.
This issue was assigned Mitre CVE ID CVE-2008-3187.
Only zypper in openSUSE 10.2, 10.3 and 11.0 were affected by this
problem and fixed.
- mercurial input validation
mercurial on openSUSE 11.0 was improved regarding input validation.
Prior to this patch it was possible to touch files as root.
(CVE-2008-2942)
- poppler code execution problem
Poppler was updated to fixes a potential code execution
bug. (CVE-2008-2950)
Only openSUSE 11.0 was affected by this problem and received fixed
packages.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:

- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

Hi Steve,
* Steven M. Christey <coley@...us.mitre.org> [2008-06-30 21:41]:

Yes I agree, the attack scenarios are really limited to
systems/people blindly importing patches for example if
received via mail.

Cheers
Nico
