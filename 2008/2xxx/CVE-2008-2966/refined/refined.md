{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in multiple files before using them in file operations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI) in viewprofile.php.",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in viewforum.php."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server in the case of LFI and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser in the case of XSS.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "LFI: Sending a crafted GET request to viewprofile.php with a malicious 'user' parameter.",
    "XSS: Sending a crafted GET request to viewforum.php with a malicious 'forum' parameter."
    ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application."
