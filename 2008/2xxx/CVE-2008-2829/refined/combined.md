# PHP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200811-05**

PHP contains several vulnerabilities including buffer and integer overflows
which could lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.2.6-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.2.6-r6** |

### Background

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

### Description

Several vulnerabilitites were found in PHP:

* PHP ships a
  vulnerable version of the PCRE library which allows for the
  circumvention of security restrictions or even for remote code
  execution in case of an application which accepts user-supplied regular
  expressions (CVE-2008-0674).
* Multiple crash issues in several
  PHP functions have been discovered.
* Ryan Permeh reported that
  the init\_request\_info() function in sapi/cgi/cgi\_main.c does not
  properly consider operator precedence when calculating the length of
  PATH\_TRANSLATED (CVE-2008-0599).
* An off-by-one error in the
  metaphone() function may lead to memory corruption.
* Maksymilian Arciemowicz of SecurityReason Research reported an
  integer overflow, which is triggerable using printf() and related
  functions (CVE-2008-1384).
* Andrei Nigmatulin reported a
  stack-based buffer overflow in the FastCGI SAPI, which has unknown
  attack vectors (CVE-2008-2050).
* Stefan Esser reported that PHP
  does not correctly handle multibyte characters inside the
  escapeshellcmd() function, which is used to sanitize user input before
  its usage in shell commands (CVE-2008-2051).
* Stefan Esser
  reported that a short-coming in PHP's algorithm of seeding the random
  number generator might allow for predictible random numbers
  (CVE-2008-2107, CVE-2008-2108).
* The IMAP extension in PHP uses
  obsolete c-client API calls making it vulnerable to buffer overflows as
  no bounds checking can be done (CVE-2008-2829).
* Tavis Ormandy
  reported a heap-based buffer overflow in pcre\_compile.c in the PCRE
  version shipped by PHP when processing user-supplied regular
  expressions (CVE-2008-2371).
* CzechSec reported that specially
  crafted font files can lead to an overflow in the imageloadfont()
  function in ext/gd/gd.c, which is part of the GD extension
  (CVE-2008-3658).
* Maksymilian Arciemowicz of SecurityReason
  Research reported that a design error in PHP's stream wrappers allows
  to circumvent safe\_mode checks in several filesystem-related PHP
  functions (CVE-2008-2665, CVE-2008-2666).
* Laurent Gaffie
  discovered a buffer overflow in the internal memnstr() function, which
  is used by the PHP function explode() (CVE-2008-3659).
* An
  error in the FastCGI SAPI when processing a request with multiple dots
  preceding the extension (CVE-2008-3660).

### Impact

These vulnerabilities might allow a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code, to cause a Denial of Service, to circumvent security
restrictions, to disclose information, and to manipulate files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/php-5.2.6-r6"
```

#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

It was discovered that PHP did not properly check the length of the

string parameter to the fnmatch function. An attacker could cause a

denial of service in the PHP interpreter if a script passed untrusted

input to the fnmatch function. ([CVE-2007-4782](/security/CVE-2007-4782))

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered a flaw in the cURL library that

allowed safe\_mode and open\_basedir restrictions to be bypassed. If a

PHP application were tricked into processing a bad file:// request,

an attacker could read arbitrary files. ([CVE-2007-4850](/security/CVE-2007-4850))

Rasmus Lerdorf discovered that the htmlentities and htmlspecialchars

functions did not correctly stop when handling partial multibyte

sequences. A remote attacker could exploit this to read certain areas

of memory, possibly gaining access to sensitive information. This

issue affects Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, and an updated fix is included for

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-5898](/security/CVE-2007-5898))

It was discovered that the output\_add\_rewrite\_var function would

sometimes leak session id information to forms targeting remote URLs.

Malicious remote sites could use this information to gain access to a

PHP application user's login credentials. This issue only affects

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2007-5899](/security/CVE-2007-5899))

It was discovered that PHP did not properly calculate the length of

PATH\_TRANSLATED. If a PHP application were tricked into processing

a malicious URI, and attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code

with application privileges. ([CVE-2008-0599](/security/CVE-2008-0599))

An integer overflow was discovered in the php\_sprintf\_appendstring

function. Attackers could exploit this to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2008-1384](/security/CVE-2008-1384))

Andrei Nigmatulin discovered stack-based overflows in the FastCGI SAPI

of PHP. An attacker may be able to leverage this issue to perform

attacks against PHP applications. ([CVE-2008-2050](/security/CVE-2008-2050))

It was discovered that the escapeshellcmd did not properly process

multibyte characters. An attacker may be able to bypass quoting

restrictions and possibly execute arbitrary code with application

privileges. ([CVE-2008-2051](/security/CVE-2008-2051))

It was discovered that the GENERATE\_SEED macro produced a predictable

seed under certain circumstances. Attackers may by able to easily

predict the results of the rand and mt\_rand functions.

([CVE-2008-2107](/security/CVE-2008-2107), [CVE-2008-2108](/security/CVE-2008-2108))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the PCRE library did not correctly

handle certain in-pattern options. An attacker could cause PHP

applications using pcre to crash, leading to a denial of service.

USN-624-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the pcre3 library. This update

provides the corresponding update for PHP. ([CVE-2008-2371](/security/CVE-2008-2371))

It was discovered that php\_imap used obsolete API calls. If a PHP

application were tricked into processing a malicious IMAP request,

an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute code

with application privileges. ([CVE-2008-2829](/security/CVE-2008-2829))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Thanks. I do not have a deeper understanding of the issue in question,
but the upstream bug report at bugs.php.net quotes a mail from a
c-client developer, which says that the abort() will most likely not
catch all possible buffer overflows, and as such allow for the buffer to
overflow.
So, according to the information from the bug, this issue might not only
allow for DoS but possibly for code execution as well, at least this is
what it looks like to me.
Maybe you did further investigation and found it to be exploitable as a
DoS only, but if this is not the case the description of the CVE entry
should be clarified, in my opinion.

Also, I'm not quote sure why you are explicitily mentioning 5.2.5. To me
it looks like all versions of php are affected, so in my opinion this
looks a bit confusing. Only a cosmetic thing though.

| [Description](#c0)  Deniss Gaplevsky    2008-05-13 17:02:26 UTC  ``` php has known bugs against an old c-client library. there is the net-libs/c-client-2006k already in portage. Is it possible to add patch from <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=42862> and others ?   Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. see <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=42862> 2.  3.  Actual Results:   May 13 19:28:17 w19 php-cgi: IMAP toolkit crash: rfc822.c legacy routine buffer overflow May 13 19:28:18 w19 php-cgi: IMAP toolkit crash: rfc822.c legacy routine buffer overflow May 13 19:28:18 w19 php-cgi: IMAP toolkit crash: rfc822.c legacy routine buffer overflow May 13 19:28:19 w19 php-cgi: IMAP toolkit crash: rfc822.c legacy routine buffer overflow May 13 19:28:20 w19 php-cgi: IMAP toolkit crash: rfc822.c legacy routine buffer overflow  Expected Results:   works well ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-05-13 22:38:46 UTC  ``` Reassigning to security. We are going to patch it, I guess we need to review the mentioned patch again.  It's local DoS / code execution "only", so I'm not sure whether we should push -r2 just now or simply wait on the next bunch of sec fixes. Security?  Will take care of it tomorrow. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-05-13 22:40:13 UTC  ``` Deniss, what other issues / patches are you referring to (besides the linked bug report)? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Deniss Gaplevsky    2008-05-14 00:50:20 UTC  ``` Also sometimes I get following error, but cant figure out the reason nor google patch so far  May 13 22:57:16 w19 php-cgi: IMAP toolkit crash: Unable to look up user name May 13 23:58:51 w19 php-cgi: IMAP toolkit crash: Unable to look up user name May 13 23:58:51 w19 php-cgi: IMAP toolkit crash: Unable to look up user name May 14 01:42:59 w19 php-cgi: IMAP toolkit crash: Unable to look up user name May 14 01:43:16 w19 php-cgi: IMAP toolkit crash: Unable to look up user name  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-05-15 13:53:03 UTC  ``` Please open a seperate bug for that and also file an upstream [1] bug. Does PHP really crash (as the message says) or is it simply a "bug"? In the latter case it's probably not security-relevant, in the first it is. Also, this might help: <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.horde.user/11777>  [1] <http://bugs.php.net/> ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-06-18 19:50:51 UTC  ``` Had a look at the patch and talked to Pierre from upstream about it. The patch itself is fine, something similar (which does not break compatibility which very old c-client version [which we dont even ship anymore]) will probably be committed to upstream cvs in the near future. The patch will be part of php-5.2.6-r1 which is supposed to hit the tree in the next few days, depending on the status of the other security bug.  I'm only refering to the initial problem. The other issues need more investigation and are unlikely to have any security impact. Please create a seperate bug report for them (also at upstream's bug tracker). ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-06-24 09:28:45 UTC  ``` We'll handle stabilization etc. in [bug 228369](show_bug.cgi?id=228369 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-lang/php <5.2.6-r3: safe_mode bypass (CVE-2008-{2665,2666})"). ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Christian Hoffmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-02 21:57:04 UTC  ``` php-5.2.6-r2 with the relevant patch is in the tree. Moving this bug away from security again, we're handling the security part of this issue along with the other fixes in [bug 230575](show_bug.cgi?id=230575 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-lang/php <5.2.6-r2: safe_mode bypass, code execution, DoS (CVE-2008-2829)"). ``` |  |

Some actions causes the httpd child to crash: httpd: IMAP toolkit crash: rfc822.c legacy routine buffer overflow  See also <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40925&edit=1>   uw imap developers say that it is definitely a php issue which you have been denying in former bug reports. So please have a second thought on this issue.  Here is the response of the uw imap developers:  > PHP is calling c-client legacy RFC 822 header generation routines  > that write headers into a "big enough buffer".  These routines were  > never intended for external use. > There is no way in the old interface to know how much space is left  > in the buffer.  Those routines were written in 1988 when that was  > "good enough". They were left unfixed because supposedly "nobody  > used them".  When it became clear that people were using those  > routines after all, they were replaced by routines with proper  > buffer checking. > The old routine names exist as compatibility interfaces into the new > routines, but the old interface itself prevents proper checking.  > ... > Let's be clear; if PHP calls these old routines, it is not just a > core dump issue; it is a security bug.  The abort catches some, but  > NOT all of the buffer overflows.  > ... > In case it wasn't clear from the previous message, there is nothing > to fix at the c-client end.  That "legacy routine buffer overflow"  > is effectively the same thing as getting a SEGV from strcpy().  As  > the message says, it's a detected buffer overflow.  But there is  > nothing that c-client can do to recover. > The fix is not to call the routine that has the buffer overflow, but > that has to be in PHP. > I'm sorry that this is bad news for you, especially as the PHP  > developers seem to be unable to understand the issue (and thus are  > telling you to talk to me).  Actual result: -------------- httpd child crashes with a buffer overflow httpd: IMAP toolkit crash: rfc822.c legacy routine buffer overflow   ``` PatchesPull RequestsHistoryAllCommentsChangesGit/SVN commitsRelated reports  **[2007-10-11 08:20 UTC] Maylein at ub dot uni-heidelberg dot de** ``` See also <http://archives.devshed.com/forums/networking-100/new-message-writing-routines-in-imap-2005t-1639473.html>  ``` **[2008-03-04 16:57 UTC] sborrill at precedence dot co dot uk** ``` php_imap.c uses rfc822_write_address() which, with imap-uw sources since 2005, limits the complete returned address list to 16383 bytes in length irrespective of the size of the buffer you pass into it (you don't pass the length, so it can't know the actual size).  This means that if you have a large address lists in your To: or Cc: headers, that would expand to more than 16383 characters, PHP will core-dump with SIGABRT.  This affects PHP HEAD too.  rfc822_write_address is deprecated:   * WARNING: These routines are for compatibility with old software only.  *  * Their use in new software is to be avoided.  *  * These interfaces do not provide satisfactory buffer checking.  In  * versions of c-client prior to imap-2005, they did not provide any  * buffer checking at all.  The fix is to use rfc822_output_address_list().

I am not seeing code path that would lead to rfc822_write_address writing more data than buffer size, unless I misunderstand how _php_imap_address_size works.  Is this impression correct? If so, we still need to fix it since abort() is a nasty things, but it doesn't seem to be a security issue.   ``` **[2008-10-14 18:48 UTC] [stas@php.net](//people.php.net/stas)** ``` Also, what is the requirement for using rfc822_output_address_list - what is minimal c-client lib version that has it supported?  ``` **[2008-10-16 16:24 UTC] [dmitry@php.net](//people.php.net/dmitry)** ``` This bug has been fixed in CVS.

Subject: CVE request: php 5.2.6 ext/imap buffer overflows

Heya,

php-5.2.6 uses old c-client API calls in ext/imap, which do not have any
bound checkings, as such it seems to be vulnerable to buffer overflow
problems. Can we get a CVE id for this issue please?

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- squirrelmail
Insufficient input checks could allow remote attackers to conduct a
cross site scripting (XSS) attack (CVE-2008-2379).
Affected Prodcuts: 10.3
- gnutls
gnutls did not properly verify x509 certificate chains. An attacker
could exploit that to trick client programs into trusting servers
that would normally get rejected (CVE-2008-4989).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.3, 11.0
- rubygem-activerecord
Missing sanity checks of the :limit and :offset parameters in SQL
queries could potentially be exploited to conduct SQL injection
attacks (CVE-2008-4094).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- rubygem-actionpack
Missing input sanitation in rubygem-actionpack allowed remote
attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers via specially crafted
URLs (CVE-2008-5189).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- samba
Malicious clients could potentially retrieve arbitrary memory
content from a samba server (CVE-2008-4314).
Affected Products: SLES10, 11.0
- dbus-1
Local users could crash services connected to the D-bus
(CVE-2008-3834).
Affected Products: SLES10, 10.2, 10.3, 11.0
- pdns
Remote attackers could crash pdnsd if the daemon was configured with
distributor-threads=1. With the default configuration pdns is not
affected by this problem (CVE-2008-5277).
Affected Products: 10.3, 11.0
- php5
The php imap module used an old API of the imap client library. The
library aborts programs that use too large buffers. Specially
crafted emails could therefore crash php applications that use imap
(CVE-2008-2829).
Affected Products: 10.2, 10.3, 11.0

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
