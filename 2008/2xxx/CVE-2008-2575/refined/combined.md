| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=448285#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-05-25 13:13:09 UTC  ``` Mamoru Tasaka discovered, that cbrpager (Simple comic book pager for Linux) does not properly sanitize file names of the image archives before calling external decompression utilities unrar and unzip using system() libc library call.  Opening a .zip or .rar archive with specially crafted filename can result in an execution of the arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running cbrpager.  Sample file name:   test";echo owned>bla;".rar (same as for similar issue in comix - [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=430635#c4](show_bug.cgi?id=430635#c4 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-1568 comix: Command executions via improper shell escaping"))  Mamoru's patch accepted by upstream: <http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewcvs/rpms/cbrpager/devel/cbrpager-0.9.16-filen-shell-escaping.patch?rev=1.2>  Fixed upstream in version 0.9.17: <http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=827120> <http://www.jcoppens.com/soft/cbrpager/log.en.php>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=448285#c1)  Mamoru TASAKA    2008-05-25 19:44:19 UTC  ``` Non-security issue is found on 0.9.17-1.fc{10-7}, so updating to 0.9.17-2.fc{10-7} and editting updates requests.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=448285#c2)  Fedora Update System    2008-05-29 02:38:31 UTC  ``` cbrpager-0.9.17-2.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=448285#c3)  Fedora Update System    2008-05-29 02:42:22 UTC  ``` cbrpager-0.9.17-2.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=448285#c4)  Fedora Update System    2008-05-29 02:43:56 UTC  ``` cbrpager-0.9.17-2.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=448285#c5)  Mamoru TASAKA    2008-05-30 17:19:02 UTC  ``` Upstream released 0.9.18. With this version the following patch is applied [http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/rpms/cbrpager/devel/cbrpager-0.9.17-zip-filen-escape.patch?hideattic=0&rev=1.1](http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewcvs/%2Acheckout%2A/rpms/cbrpager/devel/cbrpager-0.9.17-zip-filen-escape.patch?hideattic=0&rev=1.1)  cbrpager-0.9.18-1.fc{9,8,7} are now in request queue to stable on bodhi   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=448285#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2008-06-07 17:27:01 UTC  ``` CVE id [CVE-2008-2575](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-2575) was assigned to this issue:  cbrPager before 0.9.17 allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a (1) ZIP (aka .cbz) or (2) RAR (aka .cbr) archive filename.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=448285#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2008-06-07 17:32:07 UTC  ``` Fixed for all current Fedora versions via:    <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F7/FEDORA-2008-4440>   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F8/FEDORA-2008-4528>   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F9/FEDORA-2008-4501>    ``` |  |

## cbrPager: Changelog

| Date | Version | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2009/05/25 | 0.9.20 | * Zurd (zurd3+at+yahoo.com) suggested using the left mouse button to advance pages. As this wasn't user-configurable, I've hardcoded it for now. Also, the middle-button goes to the previous page (On some machines, clicking left+right buttons simultaneously simulates the middle button). * Zurd also suggested adding actual page number and number of pages to the window title. |
| 2008/05/23 | 0.9.19 | * Avuton (avuton+at+gmail.com) send me a patch to allow reading .cb7 archives. * Mamoru (mtasaka+at+ioa.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp) observed that the magic signature of 7p archives is actually 6 bytes long, so I combined Avuton's and this info to change the archive type checking mechanism - cleaning up the code (mine!) a little. Adding new types should be easier. |
| 2008/05/23 | 0.9.18 | * A bug was reintroduced (and now corrected again), which caused problems with filenames containing special characters such as [] and {}. |
| 2008/05/23 | 0.9.17 | * Several small adjustments to avoid warnings from (some?) compilers (Thanks Mamoru Tasaka) * A security patch, again from Mamoru Tasaka, applied to avoid problems with unsecure system() calls. * Bug corrected: Changes in accelerator assignment were not activated until the next program startup. Thay are now activated when 'Save' is selected. |
| 2008/05/22 | 0.9.16 | * The French translation was finally enabled. * Keyboard shortcut configuration should work now. Can be saved too! * Page list routine in the works, but not enabled yet. |
| 2007/06/21 | 0.9.15 | * A line was inadvertedly erased disabling horizontal navigation bar positions * Thanks to nentuaby for reporting a problem with the sizing of the navbar when the icon are not standard. This should be solved too. |
| 2005/09/04 | 0.9.14 | * Added two patches from Ilja Pyykk�nen (thanks!): -Key management for zooming in/out/fit/original and for opening files -Catching an error if the file selected for opening is neither RAR nor ZIP. * The Spanish translation has been updated and some minor corrections applied. |
| 2005/06/20 | 0.9.13 | * Added a 'fit-to-width' scaling option, as suggested by Leif Sandstede (leif/at/Sandstede.de) * Had to update to glade-2.6.8 because else I wasn't compatible with the rest of the libs and couldn't edit the toolbar anymore. I hope this doesn't cause too much troubles. * The Spanish translation has been updated and corrected. |
| 2005/06/05 | 0.9.12 | * Modified the 'Requesting page' to show the right page number. * Changed the filename management to process really long filenames (over 200 chars) correctly. (Thanks richardaburton/at/hotmail.com) |
| 2005/02/26 | 0.9.11 | * Dual page viewing. Experimental! I don't use it very often, but many have asked for it. * Zoom to fit button. Fits the actual view to the window, and then maintains the same scale factor for the following pages. * Bug in the config window: 1/2 page selection didn't work as advertised (Thanks Seth) * Added a 'hide nav bar' option, so you can enjoy your comics without the navigation bar in the way. To re-enable it, or some other quick options, right-click on the image for access to the configuration window. * Added a popup window to options if the nav bar is not available. * Added <space> to advance and <backspace> to backup. <Shift-space> goes to the end, <Shift-backspace> to the start of the archive. |
| 2005/01/06 | 0.9.10 | * As predicted, still woes with filename case. Patiently James Reeves (re-)explained the problem, and, after eliminating quite a few lines, the program actually works better! * Also thanks to John Paul Lorenti jplorenti[at]users.sourceforge.net for his patch. * Change pages with Left and Right cursor keys. Shift-Left and Shift-Right go to the first and last pages. (In a next version, I'll try and make this configurable) (reqd by several people) |
| 2005/01/05 | 0.9.9 | * Recognise .zip files (Suggestion by Seth Cohn) I went one further. cbrpager will now open a file with \_any\_ extension, as long as it \_is\_ either a zip or a rar file. * I won't claim that the upper/lower case problem is solved. It always seems to linger. I did correct a problem, and I made a test archive with mixed .jpg, .JPG, .jpegs and it worked. Please report! |
| 2005/01/02 | 0.9.8 | * All the best for 2005! * Problems with upper/lower case images in an archive should be resolved. * As a bonus, any mix of image types may be present in the archive. * The archive to be opened can be specified on the command line, permitting many file managers to be used to call cbrpager automatically (such as mc, rox, etc. Thanks James Reeves, jreeves[at]monkeyengines.co.uk for the suggestion). * Page index not reset when loading a new archive, corrected by patch from James Reeves. * I've included a specfile for generating rpms (see the README file for use. Thanks Emmanuel Seyman seyman[at]wanadoo.fr) |
| 2004/12/15 | 0.9.7 | * Modification to the 'rar' command to allow images to be in subdirectories (thanks to Ricardo Veguilla <veguilla[at]hpcf.upr.edu>) |
| 2004/11/04 | 0.9.6 | * Upper case extension of images in archive weren't be detected (.JPG and such). Sorry about that. * Updated the spanish translation |
| 2004/10/25 | 0.9.5 | * Added .cbz files (recognized automatically) * Ignore upper/lower case changes in image names (and extensions). |
| 2004/10/13 | 0.9.4 | * The navigation bar can now be set horizontal/vertical * Some minor cleanups. |
| 2004/10/06 | 0.9.3 | * Added tooltips to the navigator buttons * An error in the packaging: Spanish version didn't work. |
| 2004/10/04 | 0.9.2 | * First public release |

# cbrPager: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200806-05**

Insecure filename usage in cbrPager may allow for the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-misc/cbrpager** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.17** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.17** |

### Background

cbrPager is a comic book pager.

### Description

Mamoru Tasaka discovered that filenames of the image archives are not
properly sanitized before being passed to decompression utilities like
unrar and unzip, which use the system() libc library call.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open an archive with a
specially crafted filename, resulting in arbitrary code execution with
the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All cbrPager users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-misc/cbrpager-0.9.17"
```
### References

* [CVE-2008-2575](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2575)
