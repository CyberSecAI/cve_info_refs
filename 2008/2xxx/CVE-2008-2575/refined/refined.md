Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-2575:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `cbrpager` application did not properly sanitize filenames of image archives before passing them to external decompression utilities (`unrar` and `unzip`). The application used the `system()` libc library call, which executes the provided string as a shell command. This allows an attacker to inject shell metacharacters into the filename, leading to arbitrary command execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input sanitization: The application fails to properly sanitize filenames before using them in a `system()` call.
- Use of `system()`: Directly using the `system()` function with unsanitized input creates a command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running `cbrpager`. This could lead to complete system compromise or data theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted archive filenames: The attacker crafts a ZIP (.cbz) or RAR (.cbr) archive with a malicious filename containing shell metacharacters.
- User interaction required: The user must open the specially crafted archive file using the vulnerable `cbrpager` application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create malicious archive files with crafted filenames.
- Ability to deliver the malicious file to the user and convince the user to open it using the vulnerable `cbrpager` application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mamoru Tasaka, and a patch was accepted upstream.
- The vulnerability was fixed upstream in version 0.9.17 and further improvements were made in 0.9.18.
- The vulnerability affects `cbrpager` on all architectures with versions less than 0.9.17.
- This issue is similar to another vulnerability in `comix` (CVE-2008-1568) that has a similar root cause of improper shell escaping.
