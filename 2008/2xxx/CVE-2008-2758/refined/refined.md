Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-2758:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from marc.info directly relates to the CVE description, detailing multiple vulnerabilities in various Xigla products.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerabilities affect several Xigla web-based products including:
    *   Absolute Live Support XE (ASP version 5.1)
    *   Absolute News Manager XE (ASP version 3.2)
    *   Absolute Banner Manager XE (ASP version)
    *   Absolute Form Processor XE (ASP version 4.0)
    *   Absolute Image Gallery XE
    *   Absolute Poll Manager XE
    *  Absolute Control Panel XE

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerabilities is insufficient input sanitization, leading to SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Multiple products are vulnerable to SQL injection via the "orderby" parameter in `search.asp` and similar files. Specific examples are provided for each affected product in the `POC` sections.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Several products are vulnerable to XSS attacks through various fields in several `.asp` files. Specific examples are provided for each affected product in the `POC` sections.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
        *   Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data
        *   Modify or delete data in the database
        *   Potentially gain control of the server
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
        *   Execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser
        *   Steal session cookies or other sensitive information
        *   Redirect users to malicious websites
        *   Deface the website

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary attack vector for SQL injection is through manipulation of the `orderby` parameter in HTTP requests.
    *   **XSS:** XSS attacks are performed by injecting malicious scripts through various input fields of the application.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web applications.
    *   No specific position is required, and the attacks can be launched remotely over the network.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory provides Proof of Concept (POC) URLs to demonstrate the vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory suggests that the vendor should edit the source code to properly sanitize all inputs.

**4. Missing Information:**

*   The content does not provide specific details about the criticality or CVSS score of the vulnerabilities. It only mentions the "Impact" as "Medium."
*   It does not specify the vendor's response or if any patches were released.
*   The content lacks information about the exact versions of the software affected.

**Summary**

The content provides detailed information about multiple SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities across various Xigla web products. It outlines the root cause, attack vectors, impact, and potential remediation steps.
