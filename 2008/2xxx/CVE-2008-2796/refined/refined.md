Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2796:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `index.php` page of FreeCMS version 0.2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `index.php` script allows for arbitrary SQL queries to be executed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The provided exploit demonstrates the ability to extract sensitive data from the `admin` table (specifically `admin` and `password` fields). An attacker can potentially gain full control over the application and potentially the underlying server, depending on database privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `page` parameter in the URL when accessing `index.php`.
- The provided exploit uses a crafted URL injecting SQL code into the page parameter: `index.php?page=-28+union+select+concat_ws(0x3a,admin,password)+from+admin/*`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application.
- They must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server with the specifically crafted URL. No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit provided uses a UNION SELECT statement to bypass the original query and extract information from the `admin` table. This is a common technique for SQL Injection attacks.
- The exploit is very simple, which means that the vulnerability is probably quite severe in this version.
- The author of the exploit is identified as Mr.SQL
- This information provides more detail than the standard CVE description, including a specific exploit and vulnerable parameters.
