  "CVE-2008-2938": {
    "description": "A traversal vulnerability was discovered when the \"allowLinking\" and \"URIencoding\" settings were activated. A remote attacker could use a UTF-8-encoded request to extend their privileges and obtain local files accessible to the Tomcat process.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is that the JVM does not correctly decode UTF-8 encoded URLs to UTF-8, combined with the use of \"allowLinking\" and \"URIencoding\" settings in Apache Tomcat. Additionally, setting `useBodyEncodingForURI=\"true\"` has the same effect as setting `URIEncoding=\"UTF-8\"` when processing requests with bodies encoded with UTF-8.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Directory Traversal",
        "Improper Input Handling",
        "Incorrect UTF-8 decoding"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could gain access to arbitrary files on the server. This could include sensitive system files if allowLinking is enabled. Also, it could lead to information disclosure by accessing protected web resources.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP requests with malformed UTF-8 encoded URLs"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send malformed HTTP requests with UTF-8-encoded URLs. They would also need to know that the Tomcat server has `allowLinking=true` and `URIEncoding=UTF-8` enabled. The attacker can be remote."
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "Apache Tomcat versions 4.1.0-4.1.37, 5.5.0-5.5.26, and 6.0.0-6.0.16",
	    "Red Hat Application Server v.2",
      "Websphere-as_ce",
      "HP-UX Running Apache Web Server Suite",
	    "Mac OS X Server v10.5.5"
      
    ],
    "remediation": "This vulnerability is addressed in Apache Tomcat 4.1.38, 5.5.27, and 6.0.18. Users should upgrade to these versions or later. Hot fixes include disabling allowLinking or not setting URIencoding to utf8."
