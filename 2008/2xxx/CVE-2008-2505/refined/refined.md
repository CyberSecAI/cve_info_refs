{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web application `Weblosninger` has multiple vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL injection",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of SQL injection can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as user credentials. Successful exploitation of XSS can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.",
  "Attack vectors": {
    "SQL Injection": "The `index2.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` and `mainid` parameters. By crafting malicious SQL queries, an attacker can extract data from the database.",
     "XSS": "The `result.php` script is vulnerable to XSS via the `search` parameter."
  },
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges are required."
