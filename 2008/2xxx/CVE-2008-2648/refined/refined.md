  "cve": "CVE-2008-2648",

  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "type": "SQL Injection",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `JID` parameter in `journal_change_mask.inc.php`",
        "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting a malicious SQL query via the `JID` parameter in `journal_change_mask.inc.php`, an attacker can read arbitrary data from the database. The example provided is: `http://[target]/[path]/admin/journal_change_mask.inc.php?JID=1%20union%20select%201,PACS_description,1,1%20FROM%20pacs%20where%20PACS_ID=2`"

      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker can upload arbitrary files by accessing `http://[target]/[path]/upload/uploader.html`. The uploaded files will be accessible through `http://[target]/[path]/files/evil.php`."
