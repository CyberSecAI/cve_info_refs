| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=240261#c0)• 21 years ago |
|  | |

There appears to be a vulnerability in the way that the peer trust model
interacts with alternative subject names. The issue is that NSS only has a
single bit which trusts a cert for all of its subject names, not just the name
the user intended to trust the cert for.
An example would come from an https site with a malicious self-signed cert.
despot.mozilla.org would be a good example of a good launch site--someplace
where users would not find a self-signed cert to be unusual. The cert would not
only contain its own, legitimate, domain, but would include an alternate name of
a site the attacker wishes to spoof. The user accepts the cert for purposes of
authenticating the legitimate domain, but PSM has NSS mark the cert as trusted
for domains that were never mentioned to the user.
This affects all peer-trust areas, SSL, S/MIME, and code signing.
[Bug 230655](/show_bug.cgi?id=230655 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Cert viewer does not show readable subject alt names") at least gives the user an way to see what the domains are, without
having to decode ASN.1 in their head. At a minimum, PSM would need to list all
of the alternative names before giving the user the opportunity to mark the cert
as peer-trusted--this is related to [bug 238142](/show_bug.cgi?id=238142 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - server mismatch dialog doesn't show subject alt names (displays two identical domains as mismatched)").
Better would be to have, instead of a peer-trust bit on the cert, a list of
names for which the cert is peer-trusted. This would require either an
extensive change to NSS or for slightly more extensive changes to PSM to take
over the peer-trust-database functions of NSS.

Sounds like the problem is that PSM asks the user to trust the cert without
giving the user all the relevant info that the user should consider before
making that decision.
There is no other PKI product in the world (known to me) that allows the user
to trust some of the names in a cert but not others.
I object to making the trust mode MORE complicated. The user should either
trust the cert entirely, or not at all. But the user SHOULD see all the
relevant info before making that decision.
SO, this seems like a UI problem, not a trust DB problem.

OK, let me summarize:
\* This is a sec issue, and not a minor one
\* It is known since 04/2004 (at least)
\* It is marked "Security-Sensitive", thus not public.
\* Once a year somebody (like me) rediscovers it, doesn't find it in bugzilla, reports it, gets a "oh we know that, it' a dupe"
\* It is WONTFIX for mozilla-1.8/firefox-2 ([bug #402347](/show_bug.cgi?id=402347 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Not binding X.509 certificate to originating domain name allows certificate spoofing"))
OMG.
PS: Someone opened the last dupe, so you can open this one, too. Then it won't get rediscovered and duped over and over again the next three years.

It appears to me that this bug is a duplicate of [bug 238142](/show_bug.cgi?id=238142 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - server mismatch dialog doesn't show subject alt names (displays two identical domains as mismatched)"), which is open
(not security sensitive).
[Bug 238142](/show_bug.cgi?id=238142 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - server mismatch dialog doesn't show subject alt names (displays two identical domains as mismatched)") has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 398718](/show_bug.cgi?id=398718 "RESOLVED FIXED - Better explanatory text for SSL error pages") (although it isn't
obvious to me that they \*are\* duplicates), and
[Bug 398718](/show_bug.cgi?id=398718 "RESOLVED FIXED - Better explanatory text for SSL error pages") is now resolved fixed, even though this situation with subject
alt names persists (AFAICT) on branch and trunk. I don't see how this bug,
or the others named above, can be resolved (especially fixed) while this
problem persists.
It seems the REAL work of solving the subject alt name bug has taken place
or will take place in [bug 400917](/show_bug.cgi?id=400917 "RESOLVED FIXED - Want exported function that outputs all host names for DNS name matching") & [Bug 411246](/show_bug.cgi?id=411246 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - nsNSSIOLayer.cpp getInvalidCertErrorMessage should use new CERT_GetValidDNSPatternsFromCert"). So, I'm marking this bug as
depending on 411246.Depends on: [411246](/show_bug.cgi?id=411246 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - nsNSSIOLayer.cpp getInvalidCertErrorMessage should use new CERT_GetValidDNSPatternsFromCert")

No.
The "subject alt name bug" is already fixed in FF 3, because in FF 3:
- on error pages we list all valid DNS names
- we bind each override strictly to a single hostname and pair
The single purpose of [bug 411246](/show_bug.cgi?id=411246 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - nsNSSIOLayer.cpp getInvalidCertErrorMessage should use new CERT_GetValidDNSPatternsFromCert") is to fix a small difference between display code and engine verification code.
This bug is asking for a solution for FF 2.x, and I'm not yet aware of one.

I would hope that when a host name mismatch error occurs in FF3, it displays
diagnostic info that includes the name it was looking for and the names it
found. Is that not true for FF3?

Nelson, I don't understand why you ask this question, given my [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=240261#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - [1.8 branch] peer-trusted certs can use alt names to spoof").
Maybe my [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=240261#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - [1.8 branch] peer-trusted certs can use alt names to spoof") is confusing?
When I use FF 3 beta to connect to a mismatch host (paypal.com) I get an error page with this text:
Secure Connection Failed
paypal.com uses an invalid security certificate.
The certificate is only valid for www.paypal.com.
(Error code: ssl\_error\_bad\_cert\_domain)

In reply to [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=240261#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - [1.8 branch] peer-trusted certs can use alt names to spoof"),
The error page text shown above does not state the DNS name that the browser
was trying to find inside the certificate. Sometimes users are confused
about the name of the host in the url, e.g. for URLs like this one:
<https://www.paypal.com@www.badguys.org/>
I think the dialog should explain not only what names it found in the cert,
but also the name it was trying to find there (but did not).

Wrong, I think it does!!!
The error message says
paypal.com uses an invalid security certificate.
This shows the hostname that we were looking for in the certificate.

Hmmm. Perhaps you're right. Perhaps it needs to state more clearly that
the name it expected to find was (in this example) paypal.com. But I
agree that the string is there, if one knows how to interpret it.

Why are you guys arguing about FF3, isn't this a branch-only bug now? I thought the trunk mechanism tied the cert to the single host that we got the cert from so this is no longer an issue.
On branch (ff2 and nss 3.11.x) we still have a spoofing problem. Would a "fix" be as easy as listing the alt names in the approval dialog? I know we're not going to be taking NSS 3.12 and all the improved support it has on branch any time soon.

Is there any realistic way to fix this on the Mozilla1.8 branch? It seems like our choices are to back-port enough of the trunk mechanism that makes the cert-site binding, or easier-but-worse list all the alt names in the initial dialog ("you are also agreeing that this cert is valid for the following sites"). The latter is a localization change, of course, so that doesn't really fly either.
I'm guessing this is a WONTFIX on the branch. :-(

Ok, here is an idea that does not require string changes.
The current error message always displays the cert's common name, like:
"... the security certificate presented belongs to ### ..."
Instead of always displaying a single domain name, we could extract all names from the cert (using code we added on trunk) and display it like this:
"... the security certificate presented belongs to (site1, site2, site3) ..."
I'm trying to produce a patch.

Kai, I like that suggestion (displaying all the names for which it is
thought to be valid). Since those "names" include IP addresses (both
IPv4 and IPv6), let me suggest that you also plan to include any and
all of those in that list of "names" in that error message.

The code we implemented, and which is checked in on trunk, handles both IP addresses and DNS names.
I plan to use an exact copy of that code, so you request is addressed.

Patch v1 [for 1.8 branch]
Nice! Does this also fix the "You have attempted to connect to www.foo.com, however the certificate belongs to www.foo.com" bugs? That's a nice side-effect.
>+// names => a single name or a list of names
>+// multipleNames => whether multiple names were delivered
comment nit: this is "nameCount" now rather than a boolean.
The .idl needed the comment more than here, I think (if you're only going to pick one place).
Looks great, thanks for the patch!

I think it would be good if Bob could r+ this bug.
I have already talked to him shortly, he agrees with the plan.
Since function GetSubjectAltNames in this patch is being copied from the trunk, you can skip reading it.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-619-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

2 July 2008

Firefox vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) -

## Details

Various flaws were discovered in the browser engine. By tricking

a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could cause

a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2008-2798](/security/CVE-2008-2798), [CVE-2008-2799](/security/CVE-2008-2799))

Several problems were discovered in the JavaScript engine. If a

user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker

could perform cross-site scripting attacks. ([CVE-2008-2800](/security/CVE-2008-2800))

Collin Jackson discovered various flaws in the JavaScript engine

which allowed JavaScript to be injected into signed JAR files. If

a user were tricked into opening malicious web content, an

attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of a different website or link content within the JAR file to an

attacker-controlled JavaScript file. ([CVE-2008-2801](/security/CVE-2008-2801))

It was discovered that Firefox would allow non-privileged XUL

documents to load chrome scripts from the fastload file. This

could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with

chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-2802](/security/CVE-2008-2802))

A flaw was discovered in Firefox that allowed overwriting trusted

objects via mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript(). If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2008-2803](/security/CVE-2008-2803))

Claudio Santambrogio discovered a vulnerability in Firefox which

could lead to stealing of arbitrary files. If a user were tricked

into opening malicious content, an attacker could force the browser

into uploading local files to the remote server. ([CVE-2008-2805](/security/CVE-2008-2805))

Gregory Fleischer discovered a flaw in Java LiveConnect. An attacker

could exploit this to bypass the same-origin policy and create

arbitrary socket connections to other domains. ([CVE-2008-2806](/security/CVE-2008-2806))

Daniel Glazman found that an improperly encoded .properties file

in an add-on can result in uninitialized memory being used. If

a user were tricked into installing a malicious add-on, the

browser may be able to see data from other programs.

([CVE-2008-2807](/security/CVE-2008-2807))

Masahiro Yamada discovered that Firefox did not properly sanitize

file URLs in directory listings, resulting in files from directory

listings being opened in unintended ways or not being able to be

opened by the browser at all. ([CVE-2008-2808](/security/CVE-2008-2808))

John G. Myers discovered a weakness in the trust model used by

Firefox regarding alternate names on self-signed certificates. If

a user were tricked into accepting a certificate containing

alternate name entries, an attacker could impersonate another

server. ([CVE-2008-2809](/security/CVE-2008-2809))

A flaw was discovered in the way Firefox opened URL files. If a user

were tricked into opening a bookmark to a malicious web page, the

page could potentially read from local files on the user's computer.

([CVE-2008-2810](/security/CVE-2008-2810))

A vulnerability was discovered in the block reflow code of Firefox.

This vulnerability could be used by an attacker to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2811](/security/CVE-2008-2811))

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=452712#c0)  Josh Bressers    2008-06-24 15:35:06 UTC  ``` Mozilla community member Geoff reported a vulnerability in the way Mozilla opens URL files sent directly to the browser. He demonstrated that such files were opened with local file privileges, giving the remote content access to read from the local filesystem. If a user opened a bookmark to a malicious page in this manner, the page could potentially read from other local files on the user's computer.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=452712#c1)  Josh Bressers    2008-06-24 15:36:05 UTC  ``` This will be MFSA 2008-32   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=452712#c3)  Josh Bressers    2008-07-02 11:44:49 UTC  ``` This is now public: <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/known-vulnerabilities.html#firefox2.0.0.15>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=452712#c5)  Fedora Update System    2008-07-06 06:13:27 UTC  ``` devhelp-0.16.1-8.fc8, gtkmozembedmm-1.4.2.cvs20060817-21.fc8, yelp-2.20.0-10.fc8, gnome-web-photo-0.3-11.fc8, kazehakase-0.5.4-2.fc8.2, blam-1.8.3-16.fc8, epiphany-2.20.3-5.fc8, liferea-1.4.15-2.fc8, epiphany-extensions-2.20.1-8.fc8, galeon-2.0.4-3.fc8.3, openvrml-0.17.6-3.fc8, chmsee-1.0.0-2.31.fc8, ruby-gnome2-0.17.0-0.2.rc1.fc8, firefox-2.0.0.15-1.fc8, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-15.fc8, Miro-1.2.3-2.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 2.0.0.15, fixing various bugs
including following security bugs.
CVE-2008-2798 CVE-2008-2799 MFSA 2008-21:
Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the
browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some
of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some
of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
CVE-2008-2800 MFSA 2008-22:
Mozilla contributor moz\_bug\_r\_a4 submitted a set of vulnerabilities
which allow scripts from one document to be executed in the context
of a different document. These vulnerabilities could be used by an
attacker to violate the same-origin policy and perform an XSS attack.
CVE-2008-2801 MFSA 2008-23:
Security researcher Collin Jackson reported a series of vulnerabilities
which allow JavaScript to be injected into signed JARs and executed
under the context of the JAR's signer. This could allow an attacker
to run JavaScript in a victim's browser with the privileges of a
different website, provided the attacker possesses a JAR signed by
the other website.
CVE-2008-2802 MFSA 2008-24:
Mozilla contributor moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a vulnerability that
allowed non-privileged XUL documents to load chrome scripts from
the fastload file. This could allow an attacker to run arbitrary
JavaScript code with chrome privileges.
CVE-2008-2803 MFSA 2008-25:
Mozilla contributor moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a vulnerability which allows
arbitrary JavaScript to be executed with chrome privileges. The
privilege escalation was possible because JavaScript loaded via
mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript() was not using XPCNativeWrappers
when accessing content. This could allow an attacker to overwrite
trusted objects with arbitrary code which would be executed with
chrome privileges when the trusted objects were called by the browser.
CVE-2008-2805 MFSA 2008-27:
Opera developer Claudio Santambrogio reported a vulnerability which
allows malicious content to force the browser into uploading local
files to the remote server. This could be used by an attacker to
steal arbitrary files from a victim's computer.
CVE-2008-2806 MFSA 2008-28:
Security researcher Gregory Fleischer reported a vulnerability
in the way Mozilla indicates the origin of a document to the Java
plugin. This vulnerability could allow a malicious Java applet to
bypass the same-origin policy and create arbitrary socket connections
to other domains.
CVE-2008-2807 MFSA 2008-29:
Mozilla developer Daniel Glazman demonstrated that an improperly
encoded .properties file in an add-on can result in uninitialized
memory being used. This could potentially result in small chunks of
data from other programs being exposed in the browser.
CVE-2008-2808 MFSA 2008-30:
Mozilla contributor Masahiro Yamada reported that file URLs in
directory listings were not being HTML escaped properly when the
filenames contained particular characters. This resulted in files
from directory listings being opened in unintended ways or files not
being able to be opened by the browser altogether.
CVE-2008-2809 MFSA 2008-31:
Mozilla developer John G. Myers reported a weakness in the trust
model used by Mozilla regarding alternate names on self-signed
certificates. A user could be prompted to accept a self-signed
certificate from a website which includes alt-name entries. If
the user accepted the certificate, they would also extend trust to
any alternate domains listed in the certificate, despite not being
prompted about the additional domains. This technique could be used
by an attacker to impersonate another server.
CVE-2008-2810 MFSA 2008-32:
Mozilla community member Geoff reported a vulnerability in the way
Mozilla opens URL files sent directly to the browser. He demonstrated
that such files were opened with local file privileges, giving the
remote content access to read from the local filesystem. If a user
opened a bookmark to a malicious page in this manner, the page could
potentially read from other local files on the user's computer.
CVE-2008-2811 MFSA 2008-33:
Security research firm Astabis, via the iSIGHT Partners GVP Program,
reported a vulnerability in Mozilla's block reflow code. This
vulnerability could be used by an attacker to crash the browser and
run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Firefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

### Description

Mozilla developer **John G. Myers** reported a weakness in
the trust model used by Mozilla regarding alternate names on self-signed
certificates (and those with mismatched names) that if accepted could
be used to spoof a secure connection to any other site. This problem was
independently reported by **Frank Benkstein** and
**Nils Toedtmann**.

In Firefox 2 and earlier Mozilla-based browsers, when a user encounters a
site with a self-signed certificate or one whose name does not exactly match
the name in the certificate an error dialog is presented that allows the user
to reject the certificate, or accept it as valid and access the site.
There was no concept of partial trust, accepting the certificate as valid
marked it as trusted for all information it contained, including alternate
site names. These alternate names could be viewed as part of the certificate
details, but since they were not present on the initial dialog many users
could be fooled into accepting a certificate for a site they didn't care about
(but wanted to see) that also asserted that it was a certificate for your bank
or prominent online shop. Once accepted this certificate could be used to
spoof that site or perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack.

The dialog has been changed in Firefox 2.0.0.15 to list the alternate
names and users should not accept certificates that claim an unreasonable
set of alternate names. Certificate handling in Firefox 3 is quite different
and it was not susceptible to this vulnerability. In Firefox 3 there is no
dialog to accept self-signed certificates, and when users do choose to make
an exception to the SSL security model the certificate is only trusted
for that one listed exception, not for any other site.

Disclaimer
============
This is not an advisory but a reproval. These issues have been discussed for
years now at mozilla.org. But the developers seem to underestimate or ignore
their severeness, particularly when being combined. Additionally i found
(probably not at first) that more browsers are affected.
Abstract
==========
Modern browsers accept more than one (wildcard) domain name within a X.509
certificate, although displaying only one of them (the DN's CN) to the user.
It is essential for preventing TLS-enriched domain name spoofing to bind
user-approved certificates from unknown CAs to the presenting hostname.
Mozilla based browsers, Konqueror and Safari 2 fail that binding, so once a
user accepted a certificate issued by a CA unknown to the browser, he is
vulnerable to certificate spoofing.
To make things worse, some browsers match generic wildcard domain names
like \*.com or even \*.
There's a demonstration at , check it out.
Introduction
==============
There were and are and will be many ways to trap browser to a false web server
with a spoofed hostname. For example DNS spoofing [1], domain name hijacking
[2] or other man-in-the-middle attacks [3].
Domain name authentication through X.509 certificates is an additional line of
defense against browser-external phishing attempts as the phisher cannot spoof
the TLS-handshake with the original certificate. But this defense only holds
if browser and user handle certificates properly.
B.t.w: Even correctly handled certificates do not protect against similar-
hostname-attacks [4] or in-browser attacks like location bar manipulation [5].
subjectAltName
================
The X.509 standard [6] defines the certificate extension "subjectAltName". It
can be used to supply additional information about the certificate's subject.
When used for TLS, certificates can carry only one domain name in the
subject's DN ("distinguished name") field CN ("common name"), so additional
domain names are stored as subjectAltName:dNSName. (Some implementations
accept more than one CN in a DN, but that's uncommon.)
Modern browsers respect this. They consider a X.509 certificate valid for
a web server only if the CN part of the certificate's subject DN \*or\* one of
the subjectAltName:dNSName extensions matches the web server's hostname
(Some browsers ignore the CN if a subjectAltName:dNSName is present). As long
as the TLS extension "server name indication" (SNI) [7] is not widely adopted
by clients and servers, this is a useful method for virtual HTTPS hosting.
If a HTTPS-server presents a certificate during the TLS handshake but its
issuer is not in the browser's list of accredited trustworthy CAs, the browser
raises a warning. The user may decide to accept the certificate (temporarily
or permanently by installing it into the browser's certificate storage) and
to proceed.
Unfortunately, no major browser displays existing subjectAltName:dNSName fields
in the standard certificate view dialog, although subjectAltName:dNSName has
become equivalent to the displayed subject's CN. The user has do dive deeply
into the "certificate details" to detect bogus subjectAltNames.
When a second (virtual) HTTPS-server (different hostname, same or different IP
address) presents the same certificate, the browser SHOULD raise the "unknown
issuer" warning again, even if the hostname matches one of the certified
domain names. If the browser fails in binding user-approved certificates to the
originating hostname the user won't notice certificate spoofing. Unfortunately,
RFC 2818 (HTTPS) [8] does not cover this case.
Domain name wildcards
=======================
Subject's CN and subjectAltName may be wildcard domain names like
\*.example.com. Wildcard matching is not specified in RFC 3280 but RFC 2818:
"Names may contain the wildcard
character \* which is considered to match any single domain name
component or component fragment. E.g., \*.a.com matches foo.a.com but
not bar.foo.a.com. f\*.com matches foo.com but not bar.com."
So "loose matching" like www.test.example.com=\*.example.com or
www.example.com=\*.com or example.com=\* violates RFC 2818.
And though standard compliant, matching "generic wildcards" like top- or
second-level wildcards (museum.=\*, example.com=\*.com) or third-level wildcards
within generic SLDs (example.co.uk=\*.co.uk) should be considered bad practice.
Accepting certificates permanently
====================================
If a user visits a HTTPS server with a unknown-issuer-cert regularly, she may
wish to avoid the "unknown issuer" warning. A browser SHOULD offer the option
to store the web server's certificate permanently. Both alternatives -
accepting the cert on each connect temporarily or storing and trusting the
parent CA certificate permanently - are less secure. The former does not
protect against certificate spoofing on subsequent connects, the latter also
trusts all other certificates issued by that CA.
Of course the web server's certificate should be bound to it's hostname again.
The real world: results by bug
================================
\* [loose-wildcard-match]
Matching the wildcard "\*" with the dot (which is a violation of standards)
and/or matching SLD and TLD wildcards is a minor security issue, but it
aggravates the next two.
Results: Mozilla based browsers, Safari 2 and Opera suffer from it. All
major browsers match wildcards in generic SLDs like "\*.co.uk".
\* [subjectAltName-not-shown]
Not displaying existing subjectAltNames in the standard certificate view
is - alone - a slight security issue. But it worsens the next one as the
user has almost no chance to notice a spoofing attempt.
Results: All tested browsers suffer from this.
\* [no-cert-name-binding]
Not binding user-approved certificates to the originating hostname is a
major bug which enables certificate spoofing. Results:
Results: Browsers based on Mozilla <=1.9a8, Konqueror, and Safari 2 are
affected.
\* [servercert-storage]
Lacking this feature is not a bug but leads to less secure certificate
handling. Results:
Opera cannot store web server certificates. MSIE and Safari can, but that
does not eliminate the "unknown issuer" warnings.
This time the points go to Mozilla & Konqueror, at least ;)

\* Opera
loose-wildcard-match: Affected
subjectAltName-not-shown: Affected
no-cert-name-binding: -
servercert-storage: Missing
Note: Opera has no option to install a web server certificate but makes
installing the parent CA cert very easy (2 clicks). This misleads users
annoyed by warnings to do so.

servercert-storage: Missing (see note #1)
Note 1: MSIE can actually store web server certificates, but without
trusting the parent CA cert that does not eliminate "unknown issuer"
warnings.
Note 2: If there is a problem with the web server's certificate, MSIE7
just says that "there is some problem". If you want to view the cert, or
to know the nature of the problem (maybe the cert just expired?) you have
to proceed. When you then realize that the CA is wrong, the cookie is
stolen already.
Note 3: Microsoft's attitude "There's a problem, but you do not need
to know what kind of a problem. Abort (recommended) or proceed?" is really
counterproductive and will not raise security awareness amongst users. In
fact, users get trained to ignore security alerts. But that's another
story...

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c0)• 19 years ago |
|  | |

I propose eliminating or at least minimizing SSL/TLS-related error messages and
warning dialogs in the Firefox UI, particularly in cases where such messages and warnings are arguably not warranted based on the security risk relative to not using SSL/TLS at all. I also suggest modifying the Firefox UI to discourage typical users from modifying the default list of "trusted" CAs and certificates by adding new site or CA certs as warning dialogs pop up.
The overall effect of this proposal would be to present an http-like UI (possibly with an additional information bar message) for sites presenting invalid certificates, instead of using the standard SSL UI (padlock, etc.).
This proposal is based on my n.p.m.crypto posting of March 11, 2005, titled "Strawman proposal for SSL UI changes". Note that (unlike the above-referenced post) this proposal is independent of any UI changes proposed for hypothetical future "extended validation" or "high assurance" certificates. It assumes the use of current "legacy" certificates, and no change to the underlying NSS mechanisms for validating certificates.
Here's the basic proposal:
\* Retain the current Firefox UI when SSL/TLS is not used:
- location bar background is white, with no padlock
- no padlock or other SSL/TLS-related indicator in status bar
- site domain name is \*not\* displayed in the status bar
\* Retain the current "normal case" SSL/TLS Firefox UI:
- location bar background is yellow, with padlock
- display locked padlock in status bar
- site domain name from certificate is displayed in status bar
Add the following new SSL/TLS UI cases, for which we do \*not\* use the traditional "padlock" indicator in any form:
\* SSL/TLS connection involving a self-signed certificate or a certificate from an unknown CA:
- location bar background is white, with no padlock
- display informational message of some sort (as for blocked popups)
- display exclamation point in status bar (as for blocked popups)
- site domain name from cert is \*not\* displayed in the status bar
\* SSL/TLS connection involving a certificate from a known CA where the domain name in the certificate does not match the domain name requested:
- (optional) display warning dialog describing the potential security risk, and giving the user the option of proceeding or cancelling; if the user chooses to proceed, display the following:
- location bar background is white, with no padlock
- display informational message of some sort (as for blocked popups)
- display "X" mark in status bar (instead of padlock)
- site domain name from cert is displayed in the status bar
Some follow-on comments:
\* "Known CAs" are CAs for which we have a stored certificate with the SSL "trust bit" set on. Any other case (cert not stored or trust bit not set) is treated as an unknown CA. (I try to avoid the term "trusted CA" because of ambiguity over what "trust" actually means.)
\* The site domain name should be displayed in the status bar only when we have some reason to assume that it is valid. Hence it should \*not\* be displayed for self-signed certs and certs from unknown CAs, but \*should\* always be displayed for certs from known CAs.
\* In the case of a self-signed cert or cert from an unknown CA, Firefox should \*not\* offer users the opportunity to accept the certificate or the certificate's issuing CA as "trusted", at least not from the immediately visible UI.
If an informational message is displayed in this case, then perhaps its dropdown menu could contain an option to not display the informational message in the future for self-signed certs or unknown CAs (similar to the option for blocked popups); in this case the UI indicators would remain the same, except possibly for a question mark replacing the "exclamation mark in circle" accompanying the original informational message.
(The other alternative would be to display no status indicator at all once the informational message had been dismissed; in effect this would treat sites with self-signed certs or certs from unknown CAs as similar in all respects to non-SSL sites.)
The informational message's dropdown menu could also contain a menu item "Edit Certificate Options..." or "Edit SSL Security Options..." (similar to the "Edit Popup Blocker Options..." item on the "blocked popup" informational message), and the resulting dialog box could contain options to accept the site's certificate or a new CA certificate. Future visits to the site would then display the pad lock as for other SSL/TLS connections.
\* In the case of a cert from a known CA but with an non-matching domain name, if a warning dialog is to be display, then the warning dialog should be displayed at least once per browser session, without the possibility of turning it off permanently for that site. If an informational message is displayed in this case, then perhaps its dropdown menu can contain an option to not display the
informational message in the future for not matching domain names (similar to the option for self-signed certs or unknown CAs); in this case the UI indicators would remain the same, except for an "X" mark replacing the "exclamation mark in circle" accompanying the original informational message.
(I don't think it makes sense to not display a status bar indicator at all after dismissing the information message, and to treat this case the same as a non-SSL site. There really is something wrong with the site -- it's either misconfigured or is using a stolen key and cert -- and the UI should reflect that.)
\* The only way to add new CAs or server certs or to change the default "trust bits" should be through the Firefox preferences UI or (perhaps) through a detailed certificate dialog reached by selecting an item from the dropdown menu associated with an informational message (if used). (This latter option would be similar to the "Edit Popup Blocker Options" menu item displayed for the blocked popups informational message.)

I don't think more SSL modes are going to help in this situation as much as stopping bad SSL connections dead would.
My counter proposal is: If any aspect of the SSL setup fails (server chains to unknown or untrusted issuer, expired cert, cert-name mismatch, etc.) do not show anything in the referenced page. Instead, show an error page which says what the problem is to help the user understand. Also, show some technical information to help a site administrator understand what's going on.

I think we need mock-ups, .gif attachments that show the proposed idea.
Otherwise, we each have our own image in our heads, and are agreeing or
disagreeing to different things.
Frank, you seem to have proposed about 6 or 7 new scenarios/proposals.
Would you be willing to make mockups of them??
Bob, I like your idea a lot. Can you make an example substitute page?

Bob: looks OK, although we may need to simplify the language a little. One clarification: you have two "suggested remedies". Are those for the phishing case? That is to say, if I type in "<http://www.citibank.com>" directly, and there are still certificate problems, I'll still get this screen rather than see the site, right?

fwiw, i don't think we should show all the tests that passed. When I look at that list I get the feeling that "this site can't be all that bad, it has a valid key and all that other stuff"

IMO, given the number of sites with https warnings (especially in intranets?), there should be a "connect insecurely" button. And maybe also a way for users to manage a whitelist of "It's ok if a certificate issued for hostname FOO is used for hostname BAR", since that's the most common issue I encounter.

I agree that most people won't need to see the entire list, and won't understand what it means. I was hoping to make it simpler for the IS administrators and help desk techs understand what was going on. They will need to react differently to an error generated by their use of a cert that does not chain to a trusted issuer vs. an OCSP problem.
I was also proposing that there'd be no way to "continue anyway", so even those people who think "6 out of 7 is still pretty secure" would not be able to shoot themselves in the foot.
Of course, there would probably be an about:config switch for the IS team to test using self-signed certs during prototyping phases.

Intranets are indeed some of the biggest offenders in that they often use self-signed roots. In many cases, they use SSL on such a small number of machines that it's hard to understand why they don't just buy certificates. This scheme might help nudge them towards buying certifcates that chain to a well-known CA. If we needed to provide tools to make it simpler to deploy self-signed roots, we could arrage for that.

I'd like to hear more about these types of problems in the wild. Do you see these on intranets, or on the public internet?

The error page display is a good idea for web browsers.
What UI do you propose for SSL applications that do not use a web page display?
E.g. using SSL/TLS to connect to mail servers in Thunderbird?
Or using LDAP+SSL for directory queries?

This bug report contains two proposals that seem like polar opposites to me:
A) Eliminate most SSL error dialogs, and instead just omit the lock icon and other security indicators.
B) Eliminate most SSL error dialogs, and instead display an error page.
Even more confusing is that the summary refers to A while the alias refers to B.
I think A is a bad idea for three reasons. First, it breaks the "I loaded Paypal from a bookmark, so I don't have to go through the horribly complicated process of confirming that I'm on the right site" trick. Second, it means I have to re-check that I'm on the correct site every time I click a link, and maybe I can't even be sure that https-to-https form posts are safe. Third, it threatens to confuse cookies, password manager, Greasemonkey, and even the JavaScript same-origin policy into equating the "real" <https://www.paypal.com/> with anyone who wants can MITM it.
I am in favor of B.

Jesse: I think what might be being suggested is somewhere between the two.
For example, one might do A) for self-signed certs. If people are using self-signed certs to achieve privacy against known sites, one could argue it's reasonable for people not to be bombarded by warnings. After all, if we are going to allow self-signed certs, we must agree they have a valid use case.
One might also do A, at least for a short time, for expired or for about-to-expire certificates. This shows something's wrong without blocking access entirely.
On the other hand, one might do B) for site name mismatches (or perhaps some site name mismatches, depending on what the effective TLD service says about the two domains in question).
I think we need to make a list of possible error conditions and work out what to do in each.

The alias was set by Nelson, the summary by Frank. The alias reflects more recent thinking from the NSS team how they'd like to handle most problems, it would be great if Kai could link to his slides on the topic. The proposal was a lot more B than A.
Taking the liberty of changing the alias -- we already have "http" error pages, this bug is about "https".Alias: http-error-pages → https-error-pages

To add to the comments above: I originally filed this bug in an attempt to spark some serious discussion about what to do regarding HTTPS-related error and warning dialogs, by making a "devils advocate"-style proposal implement some sort of alternate solution. If there's a consensus among the Firefox UI folks and the NSS team as to the right way to approach this then that's what we should do. My major concern was and is that the status quo is not sustainable.

Uh, let me clarify it for me: do you imply that FireFox WILL NOT BE ABLE to display such pages AT ALL?
I don't know about your environment, but in my country (or region, as it may cover large parts of Europe) 80% of the sites use self-signed certs, or certs with different names. (They care about encrypted content, not identity protection. It is a philosophical debate why you disagree with this, or should \_firefox\_ try to force them to pay money for something they do not want to pay for.)
If FF cannot display these sites users have to use a different browser. It would be a very bad change. (Actually, lots of people changed to FF and Opera just because of the mentioned behaviour of IE.)
I am completely against the idea of making FF unable to display an otherwise working page. Even if it needs a hidden switch somewhere it would be a bad idea, since this problem would bite Joe User as well, and he is completely unable to do anything about it, not to mention he does not understand the problem at all.
(It's good that this one was mentioned in [Bug 363345](/show_bug.cgi?id=363345 "RESOLVED FIXED - Restoring many tabs with security errors can get annoying (have to click through many dialogs)") which was just about that: simplifying session restore to lots of such "real-world" sites.)

In conversations last week with the NSS team, this bug was mentioned as an important one for FF3, and I agree. It's P1 in the Firefox PRD as SPI-001g (<http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox3/Product_Requirements_Document>).
Also discussed in the call was Kai's matrix of SSL error conditions against desired behaviour. As some commenters have noted above, there are cases where we need these errors to be non-terminal, allowing users to override a poor/broken SSL situation if they see fit to do so. At the end of the day, we WILL trade security against usability in cases where it's inappropriate for us to prevent the user from accomplishing their task, but Kai's matrix will likely be helpful in determining which cases are which.
It looks to me like we can do most of what we need, implementation wise, either by extending the netError.xhtml page to add support for things like a "More details" button, or by simply cloning that page into a custom-purpose sslError.xhtml that is more suited to our particular information display requirements. It's not immediately clear to me where that page should live in the tree.
From a cursory look at the NSS side of things, it looks like nsNSSDialogs.cpp, or nsNSSDialogHelper.cpp,
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/manager/pki/src/nsNSSDialogs.cpp>
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/manager/pki/src/nsNSSDialogHelper.cpp>
and possibly others, would need to be modified so that instead of directly openDialog'ng, they make some determination about whether they are in a browser capable of displaying error pages (vs. a client like thunderbird) and then either display the existing dialogs or redirect to the error page, as appropriate. I have no experience with the NSS side of things though, so I hope someone else can comment on what's required from that side of things.
If we can come to quick agreement on the candidate errors for this treatment, and (dare I say it) on the error page text, I think the code involved should be fairly straightforward, assuming I have understood the NSS situation correctly.

IMO, The issue is not: "Do we (or do we not) provide any way for users to
choose to honor a certificate that cannot be traced to a trusted source?".
The issue is: "Do we allow them to do it in a reactionary way, at the
moment the error is detected (in which case studies show they will ALWAYS
choose to override errors), or do we make them do it in some DELIBERATE
way, that requires some non-trivial amount of effort (such as going into
prefs and entering relevant information by hand)?"
Once we have solved the problem of users always overriding all errors, by
making it non-trivial to do so, then there is probably no need to differentiate
errors that we deem to be overridable from those that we deem are not. IMO,
that is the real point of the UI proposed in [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)") above.
The errors that present the greatest threat, and hence are in greatest need
of not being trivially overriden, are the ones that mean that the cert offers
the user no legitiate assurances WHATSOEVER that its contents are true.
These errors are precisely those that will occur in an active attack.
If we do not protect against those, then our https really offers users no
protection AT ALL against fraud (phishing or MITM attacks).
Those errors include:
- certs that have been revoked by the issuer
(This is the most serious category of all. These are certs that the
legitimate subject has reported to the issuer as compromised. For these,
we have positive knowledge that the cert must not be honored, rather than
merely lacking the knowledge that it should be honored.)
- certs that cannot be proven to be issued by a known and trusted issuer
(of which we current recognize two subcases:
a) cert issued by an unknown issuer
b) cert issued by a known but untrusted issuer)
- certs that were not issued to the server that we are trying to contact
(includes non-SSL certs and certs with host name mismatches. An attacker
can do MITM with a real cert from a trusted CA, IFF we let the user
ignore the fact that the cert is NOT for the intended server.)
Expired certs are a gray area. There are several issues with them.
Today, expiration is the FIRST thing we detect. So, when we report that
a cert has expired, we have NOT yet checked that it was issued by a known
and trusted issuer, or that it was issued for the server we are trying to
reach. That is why, today, when the user chooses to override expiration,
we go back and check it again for valid issuance and cert name matches.
One of the changes implied in the https error page mock up previously
attached to this bug is that all that checking will be done before any
error is presented to the user, so that the user sees at most ONE error page/dialog.
When we have done ALL the checks (not just expiration) and have found that
the ONLY problem with the cert is the expiration date (but the issuer is
trusted, and host name matches), then the good news is that we know that
the cert WAS valid (at one time in the past). The bad news is that we
don't know if it was revoked before it expired. CAs are permitted to
remove all revocation information about a certificate (whether it was
revoked or not) as soon as it expires. The whole point of expiration is
to mitigate the size of the CA's revoked certs list (CRL, which some users
download), and the bound the amount of time that the CA must keep track of
the cert's status.
So after a cert expires we CANNOT learn, retroactively, if it was revoked
before it expired, or not. A CRL simply will not tell us. If we are using
OCSP, and we ask the CA via OCSP if the cert was revoked, the OCSP responder
will tell us that the OCSP request is invalid because the cert is expired,
and since that is a negative OCSP response, we will treat the cert as revoked.
This means that, when OCSP is in use, an expired cert will be treated as a
revoked cert.
The errors I just described above are exactly the ones that will occur during
a real attack. They are also the most common certificate errors. The most
common cause of these errors is server admins deliberately choosing to use
unverifiable certs, and expecting users to accept them as legitimate.
Showing the certificate contents to the user, and asking the user to decide
on the cert's validity based on the contents, is like showing the user the
contents from a phishing server's web site, and asking the user to decide if
the site is legit based on the tontents. Either way, an attacker is going
to make sure that the contents are as identical to the desired/expected
contents as possible, and this will satisfy most users that the contents are
legitimate, which is PRECISELY the basis of phishing. Users' inability to
distinguish legitimate contents from fake \*IS\* the security problem we are
fighting.
I suggest that the next step to be taken for this bug is to design the UI
(probably in prefs) by which a user will be able to choose, DELIBERATELY,
(after giving it some thought), to override errors for a particular cert
or site.

Nelson: I agree that every cert covered by your three bullet points, with the exception of certs issued by an unknown issuer, should be a hard stop.
In the case of certs issued by an unknown issuer or self-signed, I suggest that we adopt the "HTTP UI" approach advocated by Frank. So we present none of the usual security indicators which might confuse people into thinking that there was some confirmed identity. People who use self-signed certs should be happy with that - because it's a true reflection of reality.
You also make some excellent points about dealing with expired certificates. I think the right answer may involve some combination of the following ideas:
- A system, either built into the browser or an extension, which warns people when the certificate on the site they are accessing (or perhaps just for a whitelist of sites) is about to expire. Web developers can use this as a backstop check.
- Once a cert has expired, changing to HTTP-style UI for (say) a week (with a security info-bar) before cutting off access completely. This is a slightly gentler landing than an immediate hard stop.
- Asking CAs to keep expired certs in CRLs and OCSP for at least a month after expiry (to make the previous bullet's idea safer)

I think that's a bad idea. When MITM attackers do that, your https bookmarks will still work, and there will be almost no indication that something is wrong. Also, your cookies (whether they're https-only or not) will probably be sent to the MITM attacker before you've even looked at the UI.

The problem I have with Frank's proposal is that it relies on users
NOTICING the ABSENCE of positive UI to detect any problem at all.
Users just don't notice absent UI, especially when they've seen it so
many times that they take it for granted.
After you've gone to your bank's web site hundreds of times, do you
actually look to see if the lock icon is locked on every visit?
If not, then with Frank's proposal, an attacker could MITM you with
a simple self-signed cert, and you might never notice, or not until
it's too late.

Jesse makes a good point. We don't and can't remember all the SSL sites the user has ever visited, so when we encounter a self-signed cert, we can't tell whether this is a site the user has visited before with a proper cert. People using self-signed certs will want cookies to work, so if we did this we couldn't just refuse to send cookies. Hmm. We could treat the connection as non-HTTPS for cookies as well as UI purposes. But that doesn't solve the bookmark issue.
If I'm not mistaken, that kills the "HTTP UI for self-signed" idea :-((
So where do we go? How do we deal with self-signed certificates in a way which lets people use them if they choose, but doesn't expose users to risk? Do we just go with an in-page version of the current dialog, with better wording but the same options?
And we need to do something about the "saying you trust it means you trust it for all of its altnames as well" problem too...
Nelson: with Larry the Passport guy, it's not completely "absence of UI" - you'll get something like a grey Larry rather than a blue, active Larry with a dropdown of identity information. This is better than something just being missing.

Nelson, if someone's going to MITM you, and http-style UI isn't going to be a sufficient warning, why use https at all? Just use http and you're done, with the current UI. I don't know whether an https->http redirect with a revoked cert is doable, but...
As for the bookmark (and maybe history) case, I don't know how much of a pain this would be to do from browser code, but here's a thought:
We have the ability to add arbitrary data to bookmark/history items via the annotations service. We can store information about the cert in use (i.e. fingerprint and the degree of validation involved (i.e. EV vs. DV vs. self-signed/unknown). We can figure out how to check this data early in the connection and take appropriate action as follows:
All data matches: Continue with connection
Cert has changed, but is equally trusted or better (i.e. DV -> EV upgrade for your bank): Continue with connection
Cert has changed, EV -> DV: Provide mildly scary UI, allow click-through
Cert has changed, EV/DV -> self-signed: Provide very scary UI, block all click-through

Aside: Given that real DV SSL server certs from a real CA (known to mozilla
products) are now reportedly available FOR FREE, it seems like mozilla is
proposing to go to A LOT OF WORK, just so users can continue to
- avoid getting real certs, and
- continue to use certs that are incorrectly made (e.g. wrong host names in
the certs, expired, cert extensions that say "invalid for SSL server use").
If users can get competently made valid SSL server certs for free, why
shouldn't they?
Why should Mozilla pay a huge development price for their reluctance?

Mike, let me ask you to flesh out your proposal some more. Your table
describes 4 possible events that could occur on a SECOND (or subsequent)
visit to an https site that has previously been visited. I ask you to
fill it in more, with information about:
1) what happens on the FIRST visit to a previously unvisited https server,
when its cert is a:
a) valid EV cert
b) valid DV cert
c) cert from an unknown issuer, but would be otherwise valid IF it had come
from a trusted issuer
d) cert from an issuer known to the user, but not marked trusted by the user.
That is, an untrusted issuer (different (worse?) than unknown issuer).
e) cert that appears to have been issued by a trusted issuer, (signature
verifies) but has other things that make it invalid on its face, such as:
e1) expired
e2) host name mismatch
e3) contains extensons that say "this cert may NOT be used for SSL servers"
(e.g. email-only certs)
f) cert from an unknown issuer and has any of the problems listed above
g) cert from an untrusted issuer and has any of the problems listed above
2) What happens on the second (or subsequent) visit, when the cert has changed,
and the new cert has any of the problems listed above.

Note that expired certs aren't merely "too old". They're certs for which
revocation information is no longer available from the issuer. They could
have been compromised (private key stolen) and we'd have no way to find out.
Here are some additions to my list (above) of events for which we must decide
behavior:
1h) cert from a trusted issuer that the issuer claims has been revoked.
(Consider the original 4 events to be 2a-2d, and my previous question as 2e)
2f) on a second visit, cert is same as before, but now is revoked.
2g) on a second visit, cert has changed, and new cert is revoked.

BTW, NSS's cert database seems like the obvious place to store certs and information about what sites they've been used with in the past. It would
be a bunch of work to add it to NSS, and Mozilla might be able to help NSS
with the labor to add such a feature to NSS. IMO, that's the right way to
go, rather than adding YET ANOTHER cert database to the browser. I wonder
if Bob Relyea agrees with my view. :-)

Actually having your server support https is not free on all web hosts. For example, DreamHost only supports https if you have a unique IP address, and charges $4/mo for unique IP addresses. I've been trying to convince them to add support for TLS SNI for a while.
That said, I'd prefer requiring SSL to solutions that tie extension updates to specific certificates.

I originally put forth this proposal in large part as a strawman to get people thinking about this issue and discussing possible ways to handle it. I am coming around to the opinion that acceptance of self-signed certificates and display of the associated content should be conditioned on some positive action on the part of users, and that that action should not take the form of a modal dialog or even an in-page dialog.
To my mind in a production context (i.e., leaving testing aside) there are two (sort of) legitimate use cases for self-signed certs. The first is for people who want to offer an SSL-enabled site to the world, and can't afford an SSL certificate. The second is for people who want to offer an SSL-enabled site to a private group of people (e.g., for intranet use, or for a closed group on the Internet), and who for whatever reason don't want to participate in a public CA scheme.
Regarding the first use case, I think the financial argument is no longer compelling, now that there's at least one commercial CA offering free SSL certs, and perhaps one or more nonprofit CAs doing the same in future. (Incidentally, IMO it's irrelevant whether those free SSL certs are recognized by IE, Safari, Opera, KDE, etc., or not. In any case there are going to be browsers that throw errors on self-signed certs; that's not a problem we can fix, no matter what we do in our own UI.)
As to the second use case, for a private group (e.g., within a corporation, and among a set of friends on the public Internet) the site operator presumably knows who's in the group and can provide them instructions on how to configure their browsers or other applications (e.g., a mail client using IMAPS or SMTP over TLS) to properly connect to the site without errors. Thus IMO it's acceptable to require an initial configuration step before connecting to the site for the first time. Our concern should simply be that the method to do this is straightforward and clear to the user in terms of what is happening.
For example, one possibility would be to avoid the need to explicitly load the self-signed cert, either by navigating to the page or by explicitly importing it. Instead there could be an option in preferences to whitelist certain sites or domains (e.g., \*.acme.com for Acme employees) in terms of allowing self-signed certs.
This doesn't address the "Internet cafe" problem, where a member of the private group wants to access the site from a public Internet terminal. My response to this scenario is that you're now in the first use case, where you want every possible Internet user to be able to access the site. So go get a free cert from a public CA. (Another response is that people concerned enough about security to set up a private SSL-enabled site might want to think twice about accessing that site from a public PC.)

Having written the above, I realize that domain whitelists probably aren't a good idea in this case given the potential for DNS spoofing. (Memo: Don't comment on bugs when you're sleepy.) So I'll go back to the idea of explicitly accepting self-signed SSL certs on a case-by-case basis, a la the SSH model, but doing so in a way that is far less prone to users doing the wrong thing than the current UI.

Mike: storing certificate information relating to links might be useful (both for this and for getting the info out later if fraud occurs), but we can't rely on it because people have to be allowed to clear out those data sources, and we can't start issuing security warnings if they do.
Also, what about:
Cert has changed (DV -> DV or EV -> EV; i.e. cert renewed)? That's a much more common case.
I think Frank's analysis of the use for self-signed certs is a good one, although I would add category 3): people who have an ideological attachment to a particular model for certificate issuance, and want to use a certificate from that issuer. ;-)
Requiring each site to go through a configuration step to download (over trusted HTTPS? ;-) a copy of the self-signed certificate and add it to the store (the "Web Sites" tab in the Firefox certificate manager?) before a connection is allowed seems like a sensible approach. Although it's a chunk of work.
The question is, do we provide a path from the "You can't connect - unknown issuer" error page to the certificate, or do we make them go out of band? If the former, there's a risk that users can be fooled into "clicking through", even though it would require quite a few clicks. But the latter is less convenient.

I thought Mike's proposal in [comment 29](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c29 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)") covered that case. It said:
>> Cert has changed, but is equally trusted or better (i.e. DV -> EV upgrade

The key part there being "equally trusted", so it covers DV=>DV and EV->EV

Being a "chunk of work" is a necessary part of the solution to the "users
always override every error without thinking" problem. Also, if it encourages
people to stop using self-signed certs, that's not a bad thing.

Absolutely. We've all seen web pages with step-by-step screen shots for how
to override errors. I think that at least one of the windows/dialogs through
which the user must pass to do this configuration should say something like:
"You're overriding a serious security warning! If you're following
instructions from a web site to do this, ask yourself this question:
If this web site is legitimate, why is it necessary for me to defeat
my browser's security to make it work?"

Precisely! Making it inconvenient is a necessary part of the solution.
But remember that it should occur only once per server.

I think the message from user studies (e.g., as discussed in Peter Gutmann's "security usability fundamentals" draft) is pretty clear: with any direct path many if not most users will likely just click on through with minimal thought, in order to accomplish the original task (viewing the web page or application). Forcing a break in this sequence (by requiring the user to go through an out-of-band configuration process) I think would be preferable from a security perspective, and I think is not overly onerous for the use case I think is most important (private group access to an SSL-protected site or set of sites), since it would typically be a one-time operation.

This is true. Even in the case of pre-configuration of a self-signed cert for access to a private site, the site's administrator's are typically going to send out emails for

I think Peter Gutmann's doc (referenced above) has useful advice on how to phrase such dialogs. Three key points from his discussion are 1) speak in the user's language, not technical jargon; 2) warn users of actual real-world consequences; and 3) indicate what most users would do (social validation). A (very off the cuff) example would be:
"You are about to override Firefox and force it to treat this as a legitimate site even though it may not be. Most people would not do this, and banks, online stores, or other public sites would not ask you to do this. If this is indeed a fake server then any information that you provide to it may be misused by criminals, for example to steal money from your bank account or fraudulently apply for credit cards in your name. Do you want to go ahead and treat it as legitimate anyway?"

So I think we're all trending towards a solution here, but in the interests of... trending quicker, I'm going to try to nail down the concrete questions necessary to get this change in.
1) Which warnings/errors do we want to migrate to error pages? Frank identified:
- Self-signed certs
- Domain mismatch
Nelson, in [comment 24](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c24 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)"), added
- Signed certs from a non-trusted CA
- Expired certs
- Revoked certs
I don't want scope-creep to kill this bug, so it is with some trepidation that I ask if that's a good list. Is that a good list? I assert that fixing those cases would already be a huge step forward, and maybe even that outside of that list, we open separate bugs of the "do error X like you do with the other ones."
2) Trusted list. I think there is no good way to get around the requirement for an override list. I don't think it needs to be easy to find. I think probably it is an extra pane in either the certificates management UI (if we tie it to certs) or off the root PSM pref-pane (Advanced->Encryption in firefox) if we tie it to domain.
3) What code needs to be built? I'm thinking we need an error page implemented, strings developed, and hooks in nsNSSDialogHelper or other, to invoke the error page when in a client that supports it? I can happily put together the error page and strings for comment, I'm less confident about the best way to approach the NSS changes.

Note that there already is a cert manager tab for server certs that the user
has chosen to mark trusted. These are the certs for which the user selects
"Accept this certificate permanently" or "Accept this certificate temporarily
for this session" (within the same session). This tab is the "Web Sites"
tab in cert manager.

I think there's consensus that we do want to tie it to the domain name.
But I'd suggest that the "web sites" tab is the right tab to display it
in either case.
About the list of cert errors: I think the 5 cases are:
- cert from an unknown issuer (includes self signed)
- cert from a known-but-untrusted issuer
- cert revoked by its issuer
- expired cert (issuer won't say if it's revoked or not)
- host name mismatch
I think those are all the major cases where we simply have no assurance
that the identity stated in the cert is truthful, or the right one, or
where we have positive assurance that it is NOT (e.g. revoked, mismatch).
It'd be nice for some other NSS team member to confirm that.

Re. 1):
- cert from an unknown issuer (includes self signed)
- host name mismatch
I agree these should provoke a block, with no "go on anyway" override, but which can be worked around using a mechanism like we have discussed, e.g. the one I propose below.
- cert from a known-but-untrusted issuer
- expired cert (issuer won't say if it's revoked or not)
- cert revoked by its issuer
I'd say that in these cases, we should have the same block, but with the difference that we should not permit the cert to be trusted at all. That is, even if a cert has been added to the internal list, we should still do revocation and expiry checks on it, and check against the user's list of specifically untrusted issuers (ones where they have manually changed some bits). In practice, this would mean that they could add the cert to the list if they liked, but they'd still get the hard stop page instead of the site.
Re. 2): Nelson is right: the trusted list already exists. We just need to provide appropriate UI for adding to it. How do certs get there now? You visit a site using it and click "Trust this" on the dialog?
Perhaps the mechanism should be similar to the one for adding new roots. The user visits a URL which downloads the cert itself, and they are then presented with a dialog with some text like Franks (but hopefully shorter :-) and a "countdown timer" on the Accept button to make sure they read it and can't accidentally accept it.

Having had a closer look at the Web Sites section of cert manager, I agree it's the obvious place to put it. Right now, unless I'm mistaken, importing a cert into this list (outside of the existing dialogs which do it for you, as noted) is to click the import button, but this launches a file browser; it's only for local imports.
I think asking them to download the cert and then add it via local import is a little too onerous. If I remember correctly, though, Kai was looking at extending the functionality around certificate imports in here to allow you to point directly at a url to import the cert.
If we end up with a solution where we error page on, e.g., a self signed cert, and the error page says "We can't trust this. $FRANK\_TEXT. If you have reason to know better than we do, click this button to open the cert manager, and add the cert to your trusted list, but we're not going to one-click that whole process for you." and if, once they get to that page, they click a button, point at a url, and go, then I think we have a solution that is appropriately onerous, and makes use of our existing resources in a sensible way.
kaie - can you comment on the work I mention? This would be some of what we discussed back in March, when we met in Mountain View, but I confess I am foggy.

Sorry Johnathan, but "... click this button to open the cert manager, and add
the cert to your trusted list" just means that users will "click through"
with two clicks instead of one. It's still WAY WAY too easy, and doesn't
require any thought or any deliberation. The whole point is to require thought.
So, make them figure out and remember how to go into cert manager and do the
work there.

If I understand correctly, we have reached an agreement that we will NOT do "use http-style UI for bad https".
I propose the bug subject should be changed.
We could continue the work in one of the other bugs that have been filed around this topic, and who have requests that are more closely related to the latest plans. But I'm ok to be flexible here.

In [comment 42](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c42 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)") you ask, what errors should be converted to error pages?
All of them.
What special error dialogs do currently exist?
a) expired
b) domain mismatch
c) untrusted
There is no special dialog for "revoked". Revoked is a "full stop" and since the work in [bug 107491](/show_bug.cgi?id=107491 "RESOLVED FIXED - PSM error messages leave a lot to be desired") we already display error pages for all "full stop" errors.
c includes all the various reasons for untrusted: self-signed, issuer explicitly untrusted, issuer unknown
I will write more comments to describe my thoughts around converting these dialogs into error pages.

What is required to convert the errors dialogs to error pages?
The simple strategy is: Convert each of expired-dialog, domain-mismatch-dialog, untrusted-for-whatever-reason-dialog (includes self signed) into a new error page.
If you're looking for the simplest approach, and if you want to make all of these dialogs a full-stop-error-page, then ok, this would be simple.
But I recommend we should be slightly smarter.
A certificate can have problems from all 3 categories.
A certificate can be expired, have a domain-mismatch and be untrusted, at the same time!
We should report all problems with the cert at the same time.
Say, a cert is untrusted, and the user finds a way to override the trust (using the new mechanism that we will implement). Then the user might try to connect again, and will get another, different error message. We should avoid this frustration.
I'm making a recommendation here. I'm not making this a hard requirement.
But as of today, if a cert has all 3 problems, the user will get 3 consecutive dialogs.
And we agree, we still need error dialogs for Mail and other protocols.
So my proposal is:
- write code that combines the 3 separate error reporting dialogs into a single dialog
- when we run into at least one of the above failures, bring up a single error page (in the browser) or a single error dialog (in mail and other protocols)
The good news:
I have already worked on this proposal.
I have working code in [bug 345007](/show_bug.cgi?id=345007 "RESOLVED FIXED - PSM bad cert overrides - radical new proposal") that collects all errors reasons and brings up a single dialog.
I had intended the code in [bug 345007](/show_bug.cgi?id=345007 "RESOLVED FIXED - PSM bad cert overrides - radical new proposal") as the preparation for error pages.
Why did [bug 345007](/show_bug.cgi?id=345007 "RESOLVED FIXED - PSM bad cert overrides - radical new proposal") not land yet?
Because I was told: The new combined dialog that I had proposed has way too much details. (See [bug 345007 comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=345007#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - PSM bad cert overrides - radical new proposal") and following).
The good news is:
We no longer need to explain all the possible error reasons.
We agree that we no longer will allow click-through.
We agree we want that dialog (or error page) to be a full-stop.
That means, we can omit the big warning phrases.
We will omit the questions about whether or not to go ahead.
This reduces that UI to simply listing the cert's errors, and that brings up to a terse display.
Summary of the above:
- let's base our work on the patch I attached to [bug 345007](/show_bug.cgi?id=345007 "RESOLVED FIXED - PSM bad cert overrides - radical new proposal").
- strip out that "permantly override" mechanism from that patch
- strip out the display of potential error reasons from that patch
- convert the click-through dialog into a "sorry, full-stop" dialog
After we have done the above, we have the code that is able to bring up the correct error message in all protocols.
Finally, we can override that dialog with an error page for the special scenario of loading a page into a browser page.

So we have agreed to convert our existing
show-error-and-allow-click-through
into a new approach which will be
show-full-stop-error-and-require-to-override-somewhere-else
I'm recommending, our very first step should be: Introduce the new override mechanism.
Only after we have that in place switch to full-stop-errors.

I think using the import button in that dialog to import a cert from a file is a very rare scenario.
Usually you get a cert into this tab by visiting an untrusted SSL server and using our existing click-through dialog and accepting it permanently.
(We have agreed to get rid of this possibility, as the future untrusted-cert-error-message will be a full-stop-error-message without the ability to click through).

Yes, that sounds overly complicated, more so, because as of today, we don't have a export cert feature (although we urgently need that for other reasons, and I hope that I'll be able to add it before Beta, Kaspar Brand contributed a nice patch in [bug 315871](/show_bug.cgi?id=315871 "RESOLVED FIXED - In Certificate Viewer, allow to export cert or full chain")).

We agree we want an error page.
We agree we want a mechanism to allow an override for some errors (self-signed yes, domain-mismatch maybe, expired no).
We agree to make the override harder than today.
We agree a two-step-warning-and-confirm is still too easy.
In this quoted statement (from [comment 45](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c45 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)")), Johnathan proposes "open the cert manager, and add the cert to your trusted list".
Nelson, in your [comment 46](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c46 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)") you are concerned that "users will click through
with two clicks instead of one".
I think, this is not what Johnathan proposes.
Because we open Cert Manager, the user will see a complicated UI.
The user will see Cert Manager.
The user will have to figure out on his/her own HOW to add the override for the cert the user just got on this error page.
Right?
Nelson, I hope this particular concern is unnecessary, in the hope that we want to work on an approach that makes everybody happy.
(Note that I'm flexible on this topic, but I agree we should work to find a good compromise.)
But how could it work?
Johnathan proposed I describe an earlier proposal in more detail:
> kaie - can you comment on the work I mention? This would be some of what we

Attached image
[Napkin Drawing: Wizard to define cert exception](attachment.cgi?id=269919)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=269919&action=edit)

How should the user enter an override for a bad cert?
It has been proposed:
- the user should be required to do so
out of band of the connection attempt
- the user should manually enter the host name where the override
is to be active
In addition, because we must implement a solution that works with all kinds of weird servers, like servers who operate services on multiple ports of the same hostname, with different certificates on each port, we must bring in the port or protocol. I propose an override should specifically bound to the combination of {host name, port number, certificate}.
Another tricky problem is, if we want out-of-band override, but the override should be specific to a particular certificate, how should the user specify the cert? There can be multiple windows open, we can not really know which cert the users wants to override. And, if we offered a "list of recently seen bad certs", this would again allow for a kind of "click through" by selecting a bad cert from a list and saying "allow that". We don't want that.
This brought us to the idea of a wizard-based approach.
The starting point for the wizard is the "server certs" tab in Certificate Manager. There would be a new button. We probably shouldn't call it import. I propose a button label like "Add Override".
When the user clicks the button in order to enter an override, we'll bring up a smart dialog. You might want to look at the attached napkin drawing now.
The idea is, the user must manually type the hostname where the override shall be active.
We can pre-fill the "protocol/port" field with "https", assuming that most users will use this in Firefox and are trying to get to a web page.
If the user wants to connect using a different protocol or to a different port number, the user must type the protocol name or port number into the second edit box of that dialog.
(we might make use of the "select" button and allow the user to point-and-click from a list of most popular protocols, like imap-ssl, etc.)
Note, at the time the dialog opens, it is mostly empty.
The middle section "cert status" is empty.
The "info" section is empty.
After the user entered the hostname (and optionally port/protocol) the user shall press the "check cert" button.
At this time, we will open a connection to that host at the given port number.
We will obtain the certificate and check it for errors.
Now we can update the middle area.
We'll display of what's wrong with the cert.
We'll offer the user to click "view cert details" to open Certificate Viewer and look at all the shiny details.
Based on the cert status, we'll decide what can be done about this cert.
Is it an error that we allow to be overriden? (like self-signed)
Display the application's decision in the "Info" area.
If the application's policy allows for overriding the encountered problem, we enable the "Save Exception" button.
If the user decides to click "save exception":
- we'll import the cert.
- we will NOT assign generic trust to the cert
(because someone requested, the cert should be specifically
bound to the given host name and port).
- we will store the triple {cert fingerprint, host name, port}
in our list of exceptions (outside of NSS cert database)
That's it.
Maybe we can reuse some code from [bug 345007](/show_bug.cgi?id=345007 "RESOLVED FIXED - PSM bad cert overrides - radical new proposal") in order to implement the stored triples.
There is one more thing to do.
The "web sites" tab of Cert Manager must change.
Neither "host name" nor "cert ID (fingerprint) will be sufficient as a primary key, because overrides are bound to a specific port.
In other words, we should change the "web sites" tab to have a column for "port number", too, and must change the primary key to the triple.
Just to be complete:
When the user uses this dialog to connect to a site with a valid certificate, the dialog should give positive feedback like "everything's fine".
It has been proposed, the dialog could then "just go away".
(But I don't like that idea, the user tried to do something, and we'd give no feedback? No).
So, when we encounter a good certificate, we'd display "good certificate, no override needed" and of course, keep the "save exception" button disabled.

Kai,
Thank you very much for your excellent summary of the state of things. I hope I won't miss anything when I say that I believe this distills down to 2 work items (in order):
1) Implement support for the "Add Override Cert" wizard, to be launched from the Web Sites page of the Certificate Manager (based on attachement 269919).
2) Once that support exists, [bug 345007](/show_bug.cgi?id=345007 "RESOLVED FIXED - PSM bad cert overrides - radical new proposal") can be substantially simplified, and already contains most of the code necessary to make the actual transition to error pages (for clients that can support it).
Is that substantially correct? If so, I would propose creating a new bug to track the new Override Cert UI (unless there is a bug tracking that?) and to make this bug into a meta bug, to be resolved once both the Override UI bug and [bug 345007](/show_bug.cgi?id=345007 "RESOLVED FIXED - PSM bad cert overrides - radical new proposal") are completed.
Kai, does this seem like a useful way forward? If so, I will create the bug, and move the implementation conversation for your napkin drawing over there.

OK, so I've read through this latest wizard proposal. The fact that it
starts with a link/button from the error page means that in the user's mind
it's still a reaction to the error. It's not deliberate, It's just a lot
more clicks. The users will still slavishly go through all the steps.
They'll copy-n-paste the URL from the desired page into the new form.
They'll grumble about it more.
I didn't see $FRANK\_TEXT in it anywhere. Maybe I'd think differently
of it if I did. But I think you have to put in a step that requires
some exceptionally deliberate action from the user, like having to
FIND a menu item, or having to dig down into prefs, in order to initiate
the procedure, in order for it to be other than purely reactionary.
As long as it remains a reactionary step, and is the only obvious choice
for users to follow when they get an error, it won't make users think
any more than they do now. But It \*will\* cause a lot of negative user
feedback from users who are already accustomed to clicking through all
errors. They will not see it as having improved their security, but only
as having made them do more work.
I think you must make this process look NOTHING like an error override.
Instead it must look like browser configuration. It should be just as
much effort for the user to find it and do it as any other aspect of
configuration, and it must not begin with a button or link on an error page.

BTW, I should add that Kai's back-of-envelope UI mockup seems like a good
one for the browser config/prefs screen/dialog/page on which the user
finally performs the configuration. My issue is with how the user gets to
that screen/dialog/page, not with the page content itself.

But there is no way for the site to provide the user with the download URL for the certificate. Is there? And if there isn't, then they can't just click through - they have to go off and find out the URL of the cert first.
Once they've done that, having a link to the wizard on the error page is a convenience. It seems dumb for software to say "Go to the Options window, Advanced Tab, Certificate button, Web Sites tab, and start the import wizard" when it could just provide you a way to go straight there.

Any https URL is (effectively) a download URL for the site's certificate.
Once the user has found his way to Kai's "napkin drawing" page, the URL
of the failing site should be all he needs to "download" the certificate.
The bad cert page should not offer ANY instruction on how to override
the error. The idea is to STOP the user COLD from acting in a reactionary
way, such as is likely to occur when the user is being phished. When the
user is thinking "OMG, I've gotta act NOW or my bank account will be wiped
out", he's not thinking clearly about the security implications of what he
is about to do. Any trail of breadcrumbs by which he can voluntarily
vitimize himself to the phisher's attack will be followed. Only a dead end
will stop him. The cert error page should be that dead end.

After manually scanning through this bug report, I'm not really sure where this is going. Therefore, I'm raising some issues that might or might not have been addressed.
When a user invokes a security exception (e.g., [comment #51](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c51 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)")), can that be temporarily for this session only? Or having invoked it, will the user then be required to take action to disable or remove it?
How will this handle the following situations, which I have encountered in real life? (The more complicated you make the handling of these situations, the fewer users you will have.)
\* A site's domain has changed, but the old domain's certificate is still being served. (This is what motivated me to write [bug #276533](/show_bug.cgi?id=276533 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Certificate Mismatch Override Indicator").)
\* A site is being served as HTTPS without a really good reason (where a secure site is not necessarily appropriate) and with a certificate of unknown validity. (See <<https://www.biglumber.com/x/web?mp=1>>, which also exhibits a domain mismatch.)
\* A site's certificate has expired. (This often happens when an HTTPS site is developed by an outside service as a one-time project and then left to the site's owner to maintain.)
My real concern is that, with so much attention focused on security, there might not be enough attention given to usability and how the end user deals with real-world situations.

David: Firefox cannot take account of the reason why things are as they are, it just knows what is. All domain name mismatches will be handled the same, all expired certificates will be handled the same, and so on.

Reference [comment #59](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c59 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)"): I know that! The issue is whether there will be an implementation that is oriented to the end user, who is likely to encounter one of these situations.
It is likely that end users will want to have security exceptions that are temporary only or that are easily revoked. It is also likely that end users will not want to get hung up in complex authorization steps when they encounter a secure site that has an expired certificate, a site that is well known to them (e.g., from an existing bookmark). It is equally likely that they will not want complex steps to enter a secure site where the domain changed from www.foobar.com to merely foobar.com or from www.londonstockexchange.com to www.londonstockexchange.co.uk (per the description of [bug #276533](/show_bug.cgi?id=276533 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Certificate Mismatch Override Indicator")).
Since the browser cannot make judgements regarding why there is a certificate mismatch or other certificate failure, user orientation will require an overall implementation that is generally simple to use, with a minimal number of user steps to execute. It may also require user options rather than user force-feeding.

I'm sure we will have a list of the added certificates in preferences, with a Delete button to remove certificates that you no longer want to be exceptions. I'm equally sure that no-one will ever use it.

Except that a site www.example.com presenting an expired certificate may well be www.evil.com with DNS poisoning and a stolen (and revoked) certificate.

Then the site admins need to set up their sites and certs so that no complex steps are necessary.
Or are you suggesting we assume that www.foo.com and www.foo.co.uk are owned by the same people?

I don't think your conclusion follows from your premises. I would phrase it thus:
"Since the browser cannot make judgements regarding why there is a certificate
mismatch or other certificate failure" -> for security it needs to assume the worst case scenario of an attack, and make it so that only a determined user can override the error.

Which situations are more likely to trigger this capability, negligent site maintenance and configuration or hostile actions requiring strong security measures?
I have actually encountered negligent site maintenance and configuration (e.g., the situations described in my [comment #58](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c58 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)")). None of them were contrived. Maybe I'm overly cautious when I Web surf, but I have never encountered hostile Web sites that used or mimicked SSL (e.g., with defective certificates).
While protection against hostile sites is important, how that protection is implemented should not create excessive burdens on users who are more likely to encounter mere negligence. Thus I don't agree that this should be implemented such that "only a determined user can override the error". That kind of implementation will drive away users.

I agree with David. With the existing system, when I get to a bad-certificate error, it makes me stop and think:
- What is this site I'm trying to browse? Do I know it? If it was mentioned to me in an email or newspost, perhaps as a tinyurl URL, I may get away fast, not accepting the bad cert and not trying to view the dubious site.
- Din't I make a typo in the URL? What is it? What did I type?
- How well do I trust this site?
...if it's a site I trust (such as my ISP, who, like Microsoft, uses self-signed certs), I may accept the cert, permanentlmy if I can, temporarily if I must.
...if it's a site I trust and which I visit regularly, and Fx won't let me accept the cert permanently, I'll look for an extension to do it, and if I don't find one, I'll decide that "those Mozilla paranoids" are driving me, against my will, towards Opera or Konqueror.
I know that not every user will react by "stopping and thinking" the way I do: you show a luser the manuals but you cannot make him read; you can direct him to the info but you cannot make him think. If the end-user is in "non-thinking" mode, you can make your bad-cert error as detailed as you want, he won't read it: he'll click through if he can, and if he can't he'll fire up IE or maybe Safari.

Sure, I hear your point, but of course it would be silly to make this decision in terms of absolute frequency too. Of course most sites online aren't malicious, otherwise the web wouldn't be much fun. On the other hand, a malicious site we let through can do pretty monumental damage, whereas a misconfigured site that we prevent our users from reaching (until they tell us they know what they're doing) is comparatively harmless, and also easily fixed.
Webmasters who care about their user experience will have a strong incentive to use valid certs, if they want SSL. This is basically as it should be. Sites like you mention above in reference to londonstockexchange.co.uk (still using a mismatch cert as of today) are putting their users at risk. They are also not at all something we want to enable more of, by building a user interface which pleasantly accommodates them. Ditto expired certificates, where a more laissez-faire approach opens up tasty attack vectors, since CAs don't retain revocation data for expired certs.
I understand how one can look at a proposal which involves deliberately making certain interactions more lengthy in the name of security, and feel like users haven't been considered. In truth, though, I have no interest in a system, even a provably, perfectly secure one, if no one will use it.
But SSL doesn't help our users unless it means something. CAs vet the information in the certificates they issue, and are audited on that vetting, otherwise they don't make it into our root store. What's the point of that, how does it help our users, if we then streamline the ignoring of that information in the name of ease of use?
Blocking bad certs by default is something we should have been doing all along though, and had we done so the SSL world today would likely have a lot fewer londonstockexchange.co.uk's - which is a net WIN for users.

I'm not convinced, here. I think a lot of our users view us as a more secure choice, I think they're right, and I think we will maintain and grow that reputation to the extent that we are willing to put our users ahead of negligent site operators. On balance, I suspect that it will be the negligent site owners who will lose users, if they persist in ignoring the problem.

Out of interest, what happened to the idea gerv mentioned in [comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)"):
"On the other hand, one might do B) for site name mismatches (or perhaps some
site name mismatches, \*\*depending on what the effective TLD service says about
the two domains in question\*\*)."
I'm guessing the subdomain mismatches problem is actually quite common and I know it's a problem on our internal site. I may be misunderstanding something, but it looks quite unlikely that an attacker can have control over a sibling of a legitimate subdomain, in cases where security really matters. So perhaps in this case the configuration step could be made a little easier?

Yes, this seems complete, however with one more detail:
We remove the old dialogs, but we still need a combined dialog for other procotols than https.
So the new code shall be flexible enough to either report the error using a dialog, or as an error page (using the existing mechanism implemented with [bug 107491](/show_bug.cgi?id=107491 "RESOLVED FIXED - PSM error messages leave a lot to be desired"), at the time the error happens inside PSM, we look for mExternalErrorReporting).

As Nelson said, the idea is, the user enters the hostname and the protocol, like https)
The trailing /path/to/somewhere.html is not required.

Or at least the host name. And the port number (if for whatever reason the site does not use the standard https port 443, or the port of the mail protocol).

I agree with Nelson that we don't want to say that.
Just say "can't connect, cert is bad, because..."
Don't tell the user there is a mechanism to override.

If want to use many subdomains, and you are allowed to (because you own the TLD), you can get a wildcard cert like \*.mycompany.com
But the browser doesn't know whether we in fact have
customer1.somehostingcompany.com
customer2.somehostingcompany.com

In response to Gerv's [comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)"):
I really like Gerv's idea to give "ahead warning" if a cert is about to expire soon. If we're switching to the "full stop" behavior, giving feedback seems like a good idea to me.
But a complex page might load content from 20 different sites, and 5 of them might expire within the next 2 weeks.
So any attempt to give an early warning would require a mechanism to provide a list of certs/hostnames. So maybe a status bar icon (like the suppressed popup icon) and when clicked we could open page info with a tab about soon-to-expire certs.
If you think we should do this, I propose to file a separate enhancement bug.

In reply to [comment 65](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c65 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)"), One upon a time, long ago, the browser did allow
some certs to be considered domain name matches if the domains matched,
effectively treating every cert as a wildcard cert for the domain of the
server. That quickly became reported as a huge vulnerability by the usual
vulnerability alarm services, and the feature was removed shortly therafter.
Let's not repeat that.

Kai: Let's not overcomplicate things. I was actually imagining that the feature would either be an extension, or would require about:config pref tweaking for a whitelist of domains for which the warning was shown. And I think it's fine for it to warn for top-level pages only.
Nelson: why is it a vulnerability? Surely the owner of foo.com could get a cert for bar.foo.com, even if they have delegated responsibility for that domain name to a third party? So treating a cert as a cert for the domain and all subdomains is just a reflection of what is true in practice.
Of course, it wouldn't do much for the CA's business model...
I think it's important for the overrides to only apply to a single protocol/host/port triplet, even if it's a wildcard cert or has alternative names. That prevents a cert being trusted in one context and that trust overflowing into another. (This is specced on the wiki page, I believe.)
The cleanest interface for the override would be for the user to paste the URL of the website (including port number, if appropriate) into a text box, and for Firefox to go off, fetch the cert and add it. Is that what's envisaged?

In reply to [comment 72](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c72 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)"): "why is it a vulnerability?"
Because it allows the sysadmin for funandgames.corporation.com to use his
system to masquerade as payroll.corporation.com.

Attached patch

[Patch v1](attachment.cgi?id=273696&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=273696&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=327181&attachment=273696)

This patch implements a backend service to store overrides for specific combinations hostname-port-certificate.
It changes PSM to (hopefully always) provide a nsISSLStatus object, even when a connection gets canceled because of an invalid cert (as we want to do by default in the future).
This could allow the implementation of our desired add-cert-override-wizard to make use of an xmlhttprequest in order to obtain the cert.
But the cert alone is not sufficient. As information like domain-mismatch is tied to the specific connection attempt, I extended nsISSLStatus to provide domain-mismatch/expired/untrusted flags.
In addition this patch removes our current dialogs for domain-mismatch, untrusted cert or expired certs. It replaces them with an error page (in the browser) or an error dialog (for all other protocols).
The error page is simple at this time. It uses our general SSL error page that we recently introduced with [bug 107491](/show_bug.cgi?id=107491 "RESOLVED FIXED - PSM error messages leave a lot to be desired"). It consists of these strings:
It will always start with this string, where %S is host:port
+certErrorIntro=An error occurred during a connection to %S because it uses an invalid security certificate.
Then it will contain 1, 2 or 3 of the following strings. If there is only a domain, you'll only get string certErrorMismatch. If a cert has all 3 classes of errors, you'll get 3 strings. (only one of expired/not-yet-valid)
+certErrorUntrusted=The certificate is not trusted or its issuer certificate is invalid.
+certErrorMismatch=The certificate is not valid for domain name %S.
+certErrorExpired=The certificate has expired on %S.
+certErrorNotYetValid=The certificate will not be valid until %S.
(Note, if you're going to test, there are some links here: <http://kuix.de/mozilla/certwarndiscussion/proposal20061016/>
Ignore the screenshots, they do not reflect the latest patch.)

When I first read this, I was wondering whether this applies to the proposal in general, but Gerv clarified, hist statement only applies to the "give ahead warning of expiring certs".
I'm really open to all options on this. As you say it could well be done using an extension, I think we agree it can be done in a separate step.

I'd leave that to Johnathan, as he'll be doing the UI implementation. I'm ok for the field to accept URLs, as well, but the tricky part is, IMHO, this UI should be implemented in a way suitable for all Mozilla applications, which includes the Mail and LDAP protocols, etc., where URLs are not used by end users. That was the motivation for separating the host and port/scheme fields.

This might be a stupid question, but: why is it more of a security threat to connect to a site over HTTPS with a bad certificate, than to connect to it over HTTP? In either case, you have no assurance that the site is legitimate. Why should the HTTPS site be treated as less secure? In fact, it's \*more\* secure: while spoofing is just as possible with HTTPS as with HTTP, an attacker who merely eavesdrops on an HTTPS connection will not be able to read transmitted data such as passwords, whereas using HTTP an eavesdropper could pick up all exchanged data. This can be a useful benefit.
Of course, you can say that site admins should use free certs instead of self-signed ones, and that's a good point that would increase the security of the exchange. But I have to ask how many site admins will either disable HTTPS (making their site less secure than HTTP), or tell users to use a different browser, rather than fixing their certificate, which they may not have the time/inclination/knowledge to do. Furthermore, it may be that the site admin does not control an entire domain name but only a subdirectory, or has de facto control over a site but cannot contact the registered owner of the domain, etc., etc. In these cases a self-signed certificate should (if I understand correctly) provide protection against eavesdroppers, without spoofing protection.
(Needless to say, none of the above applies to certificates that have been revoked. Then you have definite knowledge that there was probably some kind of malicious activity using the certificate, or attempts at such.)

Because it gives users a false sense of security and risks mixing secure content/cookies/passwords with malicious scripts.

When is it possible to eavesdrop but not possible to MITM?
Anyway, if you have data worth protecting, you should be willing to spend the two hours to get your site using HTTPS correctly.

Self-signed certificates are already uncommon on the web, thanks the current security dialogs, so I'm not too worried about the latter outcome.

Only if they're perceptive and technically knowledgeable enough to spot the extra letter in the protocol prefix in the URL bar, which is a fairly marginal case. I would expect most people who understand the difference between "http" and "https" to be sophisticated enough to not be immediately lulled into a sense of security by the latter, in the very conspicuous absence of the URL bar coloring and padlock icon.

An issue with the content/cookie/password handling, not with permitted/prohibited user actions.
> When is it possible to eavesdrop but not possible to MITM?
It's always much easier, since you don't have to construct and maintain a convincing web page. You could, for instance, listen for any POST containing something that looked like a credit-card number or password and log those for later use. I can also imagine scenarios where you have a limited number of routers and can only listen to part of the exchange, making spoofing impractical, but those are probably less likely.

"Worth protecting" is always relative. It may merit the zero minutes it takes to leave alone your existing HTTPS configuration, but not the couple of hours (or more, depending on proficiency) to set up a proper certificate.
> Self-signed certificates are already uncommon on the web, thanks the current

I don't know about you, but in the past, I've used self-signed certificates on a regular basis. I run a site where a previous admin had apparently set up self-signed and non-matching certificates just (I assume) for the transmission security. Others have linked to other examples of sites doing this kind of thing.
Overall, as a lowly Firefox user who's also a Web developer/system administrator, I don't think there's much of anything to be gained by this, and something to be lost (in terms of inconvenience to users). But that's me.

I think that the percentage of FireFox users who set up and use their own
self-signed certificates (instead of getting a verifiable one for free) is
probably less than 1 on a 1000, less than 0.1 %. Historically, for the
convenience of those 0.1%, we have weakened the security for the other 99.9+%
to the point where it has become a derisive joke among security experts.
It's clearly time to reverse that trend.
If we need a special mode for those 0.1% of users, so they can use invalid
certs without any inconvenience to themselves, then lets make a special
"advanced" mode, settable only through about:config, that enables them to
hurt themselves, but doesn't lessent the security for the other 99.9+%

It turned out this didn't work yet.
When Johnathan and Gavin tested to make use of this using XMLHttpRequest, they didn't get all the details. Thanks a lot to the hints I received. I was able to code and test a mechanism that works for me.
My other comments from [comment 74](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c74 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)") still apply.

Attached patch

[code that illustrates how to obtain ssl status from a broken connection](attachment.cgi?id=276535&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=276535&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=327181&attachment=276535)

I used this snippet for testing. I adds test buttons to cert manager that trigger fetching.
FYI, depending on whether the cert is good or bad, there are two different mechanisms used for obtaining the status details.
If the cert is good, one can immediately fetch the details from the channel.
However, if the cert was bad, it has to be obtained from the notification callback.
In my testing, I attempted to access the listener.mStatus from within the dotest() function, but at that time it still was NULL. I assume this is a matter of timing.

This patch works for me.
I need to review it myself for memory leaks and should improve the way it references the pointers for the new auxiliary data structures, probably wrap them in auto ptrs.
It's not yet providing a replacement to fetch certs from any given port (including mail ports), I'll do that as a separate step and patch.

My response is in [bug 193960 comment 24](/show_bug.cgi?id=193960#c24 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Enhance PSM's certificate categorization"). You might have assumed "trust.HasPeer" refers to "trusted peer", but all it does is checking for "valid peer". I propose we discuss this detail in [bug 193960](/show_bug.cgi?id=193960 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Enhance PSM's certificate categorization") and summarize it here once we have an agreement.

Incorrect. I have made no such assumption. the "valid peer" trust flag is
an OVERRIDE. It forces a cert to be treated as valid, even when on its face
it is not valid. For a long time, PSM erroneously set that flag on all certs
it imported into the DB, something that we fixed recently (IINM).
This patch says, in effect, only display certs that have had the override
flag set on them. That's wrong. More in [bug 193960](/show_bug.cgi?id=193960 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Enhance PSM's certificate categorization").

Thanks for the clarification.
I have reverted the change you criticized in [comment 88](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c88 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)"), the next patch will no longer make that change. I would like to store certs (associated to an override) without any trust flags associated. In order to categorize such certs, which might be either "server" or "other people" or "orphan" certs, I will compare against the list of overrides managed by PSM.

Patch v5 removes the old nsIBadCertListener and introduces the new replacement nsIBadCertListener2, which can only be used to suppress the error message display. It can no longer be used to "make the connection work anyway".
I found several places where the old interface was used. Here is my first round of changes I used to make it compile.
In particular Mike Connor was interested that we will still be able to suppress error messages caused by bad certs, I believe in nsXPInstallManager, so I'm asking Mike to have a first look on this.

Comments for understanding / reviewing Patch v5:
nsCertTree.cpp implements the tree display of Cert Manager.
It uses several data structures for storing the information displayed.
One of them was mCertArray, an array of all the displayed certs in sorted order.
After this patch, multiple displayed lines can refer to the same cert.
In addition, the display requires additional information, not associated directly to the cert,
but originating from our separate list of host:port based overrides.
I introduced a wrapper data structure nsCertTreeDispInfo.
Each object of that type represents one displayed certificate line in the tree,
which holds the type of entry (cert from db or a host:port override) and optional details for display.
In other words, array<cert> gets replaced with array<nsCertTreeDispInfo>.
The JS code used in Cert Manager's UI needs to access these new properties for making decisions:
- can the element be "edited" (have its trust changed)
- can we display the cert associated to the element
Therefore the new data structure is made available as nsICertTreeItem and can be obtained using nsICertTree.getTreeItem()
The JS code has a function getSelectedCerts. I cloned this function into a new getSelectedTreeItems. If you wonder about the style of that code, it's really a clone of that other function, so I'm not inventing something new here.
I changed the way the "delete" function works in cert manager. In the past, the delete was done in JS and the change was communicated to the tree data structure in order to synch. As the new world delete might only delete an override, but not a cert, I completely changed that. The "confirmation" dialog will get a string representation for each selected item, but it will no longer delete. Instead the delete requests are sent to the data structure that holds the display items (nsICertTree) and will decide accordingly. A cert will not get deleted while there are still other items refering to it (for this I'm using the new helper data structure nsCertAddonInfo which holds the cert and a reference counter).
Some words about the visual presentation and the possible data behind it.
In the past, the web sites tab would only display the following kinds of certs:
- server certs that got imported and have permanent trust associated
After the new patch, it will no longer be possible to use "bad cert alert click through" and have certs permanently trusted. But end users who update to a newer version of Mozilla may still have such old overrides stored in their profile. So, we must continue to display them. In order to distinguish them, they will be shown with a '\*' in the new Sites column, indicating the cert is valid for 'any' host. (Cert Manager will allow the user to manually delete such old entries.)
The new kind of overrides are host:port specific. A cert is associated and only the given cert will be accepted on the host:port. The cert will not be allowed for any other host:port combinations, unless there are additional overrides stored for the same cert (which will be listed as separate lines in the display).
An example for such an override is shown in the screenshot for mur.at:443
The third kind of visual represenatation is kind of an edge case. Most users will never see it. The new kind of overrides are not stored in the NSS database, instead we manage them at the application level in the PSM code. Profiles contain a new text file cert\_overrides.txt (more on this file later). As of today, the certificate database files are closely related to the application profile. However, this will change in the nearby future. The NSS database can be shared amongst multiple applications (and each user login will likely only have a single database).
In such a shared scenario, the cert we had stored for convenience might get "lost" (because the user deleted it using some other application). When this happens, our application will no longer be able to display the certificate associated to an override. Instead, the proposed UI will display the cert as (Unknown) for organization and (Not Stored) for certificate name. However, the override will still work. We stored the fingerprint of the certificate together with the override and will be able to detect the matching cert at the time we connect to the site.
Based on the above three kinds of lines, I adjusted the state of the edit and view buttons.
The "edit" (trust) button can only be used when an old-style permanent-trust item is selected. The button is grayed out for the new host:port overrides. You can't edit them, only delete them. You can, however, re-run the wizard for the same host:port, and the resulting new entry will replace the current one.
The "view" (cert) button can be used for old-style entries and for new-style entries if the associated cert is available in the database. It's disabled for the entries where the cert got lost.
Some details about the new configuration file cert\_overrides.txt
It's an ASCII file, one entry per line, stores host:port, SHA-1 fingerprint of associated certificate, the certificate "key" for finding it in the database (as base64 encoded issuer name + serial number).
Finally, it contains a string representation of a bitmask, where the bits are M (overrides domain mismatch), U (override untrusted, the equivalent of the old permanent trust) and T (override Time errors like expired or not-yet-trusted).
This bitmask represents the errors shown to the user at the time the user used the "add exception" wizard.
Suppose, at the time the wizard was used, the cert had a "mismatch" but was otherwise valid. The user adds an exception. We only store an override for the mismatch. If at a later time the certificate becomes untrusted (by changing global trust) or expires, we will again reject a connection to the site. The user will be forced to re-run the wizard to override the new failures, if desired.
Example line from this file:
mur.at:443 SHA1 70:BC:BA:13:58:11:86:D0:31:FD:21:0B:94:D9:C1:E2:E3:D1:26:2D MU AAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAAAVjMFMFQxFDASBgNVBAoTC0NBY2VydCBJbmMuMR4wHAYD VQQLExVodHRwOi8vd3d3LkNBY2VydC5vcmcxHDAaBgNVBAMTE0NBY2VydCBDbGFz cyAzIFJvb3Q=
You'll see that the patch completely removes the old dialogs:
- domain-mismatch
- untrusted cert
- expired cert
The patch contains a change I wanted to do earlier, but couldn't do on the 1.8 branch:
nsIX509Cert3 derives from nsIX509Cert2 which derives from nsIX509Cert
The patch still contains some "#if 0" sections with brainstorming, I'll remove them before the final patch.
Minor TODO for the next patch, I will work on this while we review:
- I need to make the cert-overrides service threadsafe. This will be a small change on top of this patch to use a lock around accessing the in-memory list of overrides.
- I must clean up the in-memory-array in nsCertTree::FreeCertArray(), just a simple loop

Elsewhere there is a RFE requesting that we get rid of the Edit button,
and combine the edit function (which is merely 3 checkboxes) into the
other cert list views, such as the cert chain view (used to view server
certs) and the cert manager's tabs. Can we consider that change now?

I'm ok with the idea of doing that change, but it does not overlap with the code changes in this bug, and there I would like to keep it as a separate task.
Explaining why it's separate in more detail:
- this bug does not touch how "edit" and "view" work (it only touches whether buttons are enabled or disabled), so all such changes would not overlap with the patch.
- your requested change would touch the UI for all cert manager tabs (while this patch only changes the web sites tab)

I agree both with the idea of the change mentioned by Nelson in [comment 96](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c96 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)"), and with Kai's assessment that we not include it in the work here. This is already a large patch, and codependent in an uncomfortable way with the one in [bug 387480](/show_bug.cgi?id=387480 "RESOLVED FIXED - Support network-fetched cert import in Servers tab of Cert Mgr (\"Add Exception\" dialog)"), I think we should be looking to minimize the delta here, rather than adding on, even if the work is related.

[Patch v6](attachment.cgi?id=281307&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=281307&action=edit)

Ok, my TODO list for this patch is done.
Can you please review?
I added the cleanup (converted the array in observer service to hold nsRefPtr, not raw pointers) and the thread safety changes (added a monitor to the observer service).
I've changed the uuids for the interfaces where I change the inheritance.
I've done a round of self reviewing and hopefully no longer have leaks.
I renamed some variables for clarity and added a bunch of comments.
If you wonder why I did that change in the SmartCardEvent code, it is to fix a compiler warning about incorrect order of initializers.
The screen shot and the patch for code outside of PSM remain unchanged.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=281800&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=327181&attachment=281800)

BobR sent me review comments by private mail.
Here is the next patch.
The patch no longer contains the changes to extensions/help, they are included in that other patch attached to this bug (already reviewed by Mike).
The patch contains an addition to config/system-headers, so that linking works on x86\_64.
Other changes requested by Bob are:
- renamed selected\_cert\_index to selected\_index for clarity
- removed an unused var
- removed a TODO comment that is now done
- added some more out-of-memory checks and null checks around
GetCertsByTypeFromCertList
- simplified some bit handling code
- converted the use of sha1 to sha256 and changed it to be generic
based on hash algorithm identifier OIDs
- removed unnecessary writing of cert overrides on profile switch
(we write whenever adding or removing an entry)

FYI, entries in cert\_override.txt now look like this:
mur.at:443 OID.2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1 F8:92:08:EE:6D:C9:26:3F:5B:2C:0E:E8:14:35:33:AA:AB:44:61:2D:48:BA:36:B5:59:E5:B8:6D:76:6A:39:E3 MU AAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAAAVjMFMFQxFDASBgNVBAoTC0NBY2VydCBJbmMuMR4wHAYD VQQLExVodHRwOi8vd3d3LkNBY2VydC5vcmcxHDAaBgNVBAMTE0NBY2VydCBDbGFz cyAzIFJvb3Q=
FYI, the columns in that config file are separated by tabs. The base64-encoded cert contains spaces, these were converted from the original newlines to spaces. This was the most efficient conversion that keeps the data in a single line, without requiring buffer shifting. The decoder will skip all whitespace.
No UI changes in patch v7.

> Kai, what's the colon-separated hex, and why isn't it base64 encoded instead?
The fields in the line are:
- host:port
- OID of hash algorithm (fingerprint algorithm)
- the fingerprint in colon-separated-hex (in this case sha256)
- bitmask of M, U, T for overrides
- base64-encoded issuer+serial number (dbkey)
When comparing a site's cert against the stored override, we will compare both issuer+serial number and the fingerprint.

Changes outside of PSM based on Patch v5
Why wouldn't you just remove the badCertListener from xpinstall like you did elsewhere? There are two cases in XPInstall: if "chrome" is doing the install (extension update or plugin finder, for example) then we wanted to suppress the dialogs. If the user entered the URL in the address bar then we wanted it to work "like the web". But if normal surfing doesn't get dialogs anymore then I don't need a badcertlistener2 to supress them, right?
sr=dveditz overall. we can file a followup bug on xpinstall if we want to change it.

Note also [bug 228684](/show_bug.cgi?id=228684 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Remember overrides of Certificate Domain Name Mismatch"), which deals with the user experience of nagging dialog box popups.
There is an extension to help deal with certificates that have problems: the user is given the option to create a whitelist, so that mismatched domains or expired certificates can still be honored without incident.
The UI for this extension is very good. With the opportunity to create a whitelist for frequently-encountered certificates, the user will encounter errors much less often.
Having less errors for the user means less chance of annoying the user into just blindly clicking past everything and not reading the warnings in the first place. These popup dialog boxes are "crying wolf" too often, teaching users to ignore symptoms of a real attack.
If the suggested change is made here, to change these SSL errors from popup dialogs to placeholder webpages, I hope this whitelist UI enhancement can be made at the same time.

It's a bit more complicated.
It's correct to say "normal surfing will no longer display error dialogs for bad certs".
This is because we are introducing error pages.
But displaying an error page only works when an SSL connection happens in the context of a browser window / docshell, that provides the error page capability.
For all other contexts, like SSL mail connections, xmlhttprequests started from chrome, a different mechanism is used to communicate connection errors to the user: An error dialog.
We have a new single error dialog that will displayed for any SSL connection errors outside of a browser window. The dialog will explain the error with a localized error message and a always-english-error-identifier. The dialog will not allow to "click through", it will be a "hard failure" notification message.
So, if application code like xpinstall runs into a SSL connection failure, you will get an error message by default. If you want to suppress that, you can provide a context object that overrides the new nsIBadCertListener2 interface, which will receive a callback upon a bad cert error, with the ability to stop PSM from bringing up the error dialog.

Yes, we're in C++ code, so overloading functions with different arguments is allowed.
Adding a dependency to [bug 397296](/show_bug.cgi?id=397296 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox builds need to use the current NSS CVS tag"), because the patch in this bug requires the rather new function SEC\_StringToOID. However, I might temporarily add a static renamed copy of that function to my PSM check in, so we aren't blocked in landing this one. If I do, I'll revert it once we get the new tag.

This is the patch I checked in today.
It combines the two reviewed patches attached to this bug.
It also has the bustage fix for camino (top of patch).
It contains a copy of a NSS function that has not yet landed, will be removed soon. (for justification see comment in file mozilla/security/manager/ssl/src/nsCertOverrideService.cpp )
I adjusted the merge conflict that resulted from the recent landing of the cert export functionality.

This took me several minutes to figure out given the state of our security prefs UI (you achieved your goal!):

Thanks, I can now again access my work email. I am not so sure that the average user will find this in the options though. Shouldn't this error page have some sort of "i want to access this evil web page anyway, add it to the exception list" button?

If you read the discussion above, the whole idea is to make it really hard to access such sites to improve the users' security and force the administrators to fix their servers.
I do wonder if the less passionate users will just switch to other browsers. Hopefully people that absolutely have to access improperly configured servers will be smart enough to google the instructions (there aren't any at the time, but that's because the change just went in).

I work with security appliances that are access with SSL over SSH tunnels which means that all URL's look like <https://127.0.0.1>:<per device tunnel port>/ which means this will be a major pain adding 100+ certificates using the new UI.
Is there a way to wildcard the host:port in cert\_override.txt ?

A wildcard is not currently possible. Are all your applicances use the same cert? Then you could duplicate the lines in cert\_override.txt and change the port number (you should modify the file while the application is not running).

I see another problem with using host:port as the key, most home router appliances have the address of 192.168.1.1 and if you switch between two networks with different certificates it's not possible to have both in the exception list or am I wrong ? In my case most of them have the same certificate but the ports of the tunnels are sometimes reused between different devices with different certificates (this can of course be worked around by modifying my ~/.ssh/config).

Correct. Only one entry per host:port or ip:port

Yes, you could also have dummy entries in your /etc/hosts file (or other OS equivalent) where you place dummy hostnames for your individual decvices, like
mydevice-1 127.0.0.1
mydevice-2 127.0.0.1
Then the stored overrides could be bound to those dummy hostnames, even if you're using the same port.

If you are using a laptop that you're carrying with you and visiting different home networks, you can use the /etc/hosts trick there, too.
my-apartment-in-new-york 192.168.1.1
my-apartment-in-london 192.168.1.1
Instead of using <https://192.168.1.1>
you'll use
<https://my-apartment-in-new-york>
or
<https://my-apartment-in-london>
That way you can add individual overrides for the same IP, same port, with different certs.

First off, I agree with the fact that people without appropriate network sophistication will have trouble with this, and that we need to think about providing, if not instructions, at least explanations in a clearer fashion. I intend to file a follow-up bug about that.
Giving preferential treatment to RFC1918 networks is something I thought about too, but consider: The reason we're doing this is to respond to the gross vulnerability of the old system ("click okay to make this dialog go away and trust the untrusted cert") to man in the middle attacks.
The concern is that a user on, for instance, coffee shop wireless clicks their web banking bookmark, and is MiTM'd. The rogue AP is diverting <https://www.bank.com> to a server they operate in order to steal credentials or otherwise exploit trust. In such a case, using an RFC1918 class address is absolutely something the attacker could do - indeed, the server is \*likely\* to be running on the same machine as the rogue AP.
Simson Garfinkel talks about key continuity management (e.g. <http://www.truststc.org/pubs/5/johnny2_talk.pdf> ) as a way to approach this too - saying that rather than shut down self-signed certs completely in cases where CA-verified identity doesn't matter, we should just remember the certs we see, let the traffic flow, and only make noise when the cert CHANGES, since that is the specific hallmark of a MitM attack. However, in a situation where an individual is moving between, and administering, multiple routers that use the same IP address but different, non-trusted certs, this won't help either, as I understand it.

I think it is necessary to block bad certs on first sight, too.
Say you're getting a phishing email, with a link to a fake site that looks like paypal.
We have no choice to detect the site is supposed to fake a site you have visited before, and therefore can't do a cert comparison with the known real papyal cert. If we don't block the cert on first visit, the attacker succeeds.

I think it would be safe for Firefox to allow https connections to 127.0.0.1 (at least ones where the IP address is in the URL, rather than a hostname). Kinda hard to MITM those :)

I think we should be careful here - this change is an important one for
preventing things like MitM, and more generally for changing our default user
education around "granting things trust is the default option" but I wouldn't
want to go too far down a path of treating it as a fix for email-based phishing
attacks.
I agree that the attack you describe would be thwarted, but the APWG says the
number of phishing attacks using SSL is still quite small - I think whether we
do things this way or not (particularly so if we block on first contact, of
course) most phishers will not bother with SSL at all unless they perceive some
payoff there, and hence that the need to block those attacks is secondary.
Though, of course, this is subject to change.
Since this bug is closed and has a large CC list, I've opened two follow-ups:
- [bug 398718](/show_bug.cgi?id=398718 "RESOLVED FIXED - Better explanatory text for SSL error pages") to track suggestions for making the error page more

On a corporate network a malicious admin can populate the cert\_overrides.txt file on your corporate workstation with whatever he likes, if he has control over your DNS or the corporate HTTP proxy the attack is possible even with todays implementation. There are many other ways your network/workstation admin can attack you. The "no malicious administrator" assumption is just that, an assumption.
I have visited a lot of corporate intranets that use certificates from a self-signed CA where the CA certificate can be obtained from a SSL site with uses a certificate signed by said CA, this makes it kind of catch-22.

If we do this, a phisher could say:
"Download and click this program ...
(which is a shell script that starts ssh to open a port on 127.0.0.1
with a tunnel-forwarding-ssl-connection)
... then you will be able to access your bank account again..."
I'm not sure if this is sufficient justification against your proposal.
If you still think we should do this, we might want to open a separate bug for discussion.

Ok, Johnathan's example of roaming in an wireless hotspot is better (where the hostspot provider does not have physical access to your laptop, but you are still forced to go through that foreign network.)
I propose we move the discussion to a separate bug report that combines the proposals around RFC1918 addresses and 127.0.0.1

My Linksys home router has an option to "Use HTTPS administration" (disabled by default). When enabled, the web interface uses a cert that's not signed by a CA in our root store. Probably not a very common scenario, but I don't think it's as far-fetched as you make it sound.

We use something called a Safepipe. The http page is simply a form with a button "Please switch to HTTPS now by clicking the 'Continue' button." and the cert has a CN of "Safepipe Configuration Interface" so you'll always get a mismatch.

Neil, thanks for the info.
It's unfortunate to hear that product vendors are institutionalizing the
use of certs that fail validity tests. Do they let you replace the
initial cert with a valid one?

In answer to my own question of [comment 137](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181#c137 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)"), yes, SafePipe does permit a
real CA certificate to be installed as a trusted CA certificate, and enables
a user go generate his own certificate request, send it to a CA, and get a
real cert from a CA, and install it in the SafePipe.
SafePipe products also have built-in CA software that permits a user to
issue his own self-signed CA cert and then use that to issue his own
server certs. One SafePipe product can act as the CA for any number of
their products.
It appears they can also generate self-signed server certs, with no CA
cert involved.
Their instructional web page <http://www.eicon.com/support/helpweb/safepipe/x509.htm>
only explains the use of their own built-in CA software for cert issuance,
and does not explain how to get a cert from a real CA. It also does not
explain the necessity of installing the self-signed CA cert into any browsers
that wish to communicate with these products using SSL.
So, I conclude that these products probably CAN be used with certs from
trusted CAs, and when these products are used as CAs, they produce CA certs
that can be installed in browsers as valid CA certs. Either of those
methods would be preferable (IMO) to using self-signed server certs.

I tested my Linksys and it does come pre-installed with a certificate. I enabled https on it, and was able to connect after adding it as an exception. It did \*appear\*, however, that all such boxes use the same cert/private key, so I don't think it adds as much security as I would have hoped.

OMG! Bob, you're being so polite. If All those boxes use the same cert/priv
key, then any such box, off the shelf, can masquerade for any other. It's an
off-the-shelf MITM attack against all wireles router boxes of that brand. !!

I'm a bit uneasy with this change.
+ As an internet user I'm glad that there will be more pressure on system administrators to get their TLS-setups correct.
- As a Firefox user I'm afraid that many people will switch back to less secure browsers simply to spare them the annoyance of being blocked out from a site (however badly managed). Keep in mind: Clicking that other icon on your desktop to start a different browser is \*easier\* than adding an exception for the site in question. Keeping the task oriented user from accessing a site with an invalid certificate would imply hindering that person from starting a different browser. I foresee a \*huge\* backlash upon the release of Firefox 3. If this remains in the release we need an extremely well prepared information campaign and an army of bugzilla duplicate killers.
- As someone who offers TLS as service for various websites I feel this step comes too early. I have to run all the websites from the same IP address (everything else would be cost prohibitive) and all on the same port. The OpenSSL-library didn't ship yet a stable version with TLS server name indication and once it will be released it will take some time to show up in other software/package distributions. This means I'll have to explain to my users how to add exceptions for their domains in Firefox, training them to accept the same advice more easily from phishers too.
So all in all I simply think that it is too early for this change to be made. It will cost Firefox a lot of goodwill and not necessarily make the internet a more secure place.

Hi, just found this bug after downloading the latest nightly and couldn't access a router with a built-in certificate. My company manages over 400 of these devices, assigning each one a DNS entry under our domain for easy management.
Judging by the comments above it's going to be suggested that 1) we should manually enter all 400 of these hostnames into the UI, or 2) we're fools who are begging to have our network brought down by hackers because we're not going through the trouble of installing a custom certificate in each of these devices. Neither of these suggestions are helpful.
I know this bug is closed, but I have 2 suggestions:
1) allow wildcard entries for domain mismatches, eg use the UI to load the cert as currently happens, but then have a box to "allow this cert to be used for sites at \*.foo.com." This is a deal breaker, and our company will have to use another web browser if things don't change, because management of a list of every device over 50 users' browsers is just not feasible.
2) a simple sentence in the error page such as "if you trust this site, add it to the exception list in your preferences." Don't spell out for the user how to do so, for the valid concerns above, but do advise of the possibility.

I've just used the latest build of minefield (2007102205) and was presented with the message below and "Try again". It's a self-signed certificate. This is a major problem IMHO:
a) It's not clear what the problem is - "The security certificate issuer (name here) is not trusted"
b) Try again? (the certificate issuer isn't going to change)
c) No way to accept (certainly none that are obvious) - what if the only way to obtain the CA certificate is to download it from the said website? I'd be stuck
d) Many, many places have self-signed certificates - most internal sites, most appliances, even Microsoft's licensing site (which is dreadful of them I must say)
If this stays as it is without a way to allow the trust to be added easily and permanently then this will have the effect that people will use another browser. NB: I say permanently since if the user is continuously prompt with "allow" dialog boxes then they will automatically click them instead of checking.
Secure Connection Failed
An error occurred during a connection to www.example.com:443 because it uses an invalid security certificate.

Another data point:
I filed <https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2153> due to some Maemo websites having certificate issues. I had to use FF2 to get more detail about exactly what was failing... For example, www.maemo.org was presenting a cert for maemo.org, and repository.maemo.org was presenting a cert for a248.e.akamai.net (!). Im FF3, the same generic error was reported for all of them.
A small, but very important, use case of these error pages will be for web admins trying to determine why Firefox 3 isn't working for users. If there isn't a good way to detail the error for everyone, adding a "More Info" or "Advanced" button or somesuch would be something to consider.

I just wanted to say I agree with Adrian Bridgett
This is major inconvenience, many people including myself have home brewed web servers, there are internal websites, etc... that all use "untrusted" certs. I had to google to figure out how to add my site to the trusted list (w/e). This will for sure drive many user away. It makes my life harder, because I'd like to use ssl, but then if I have a few finds visit the site, they'd wouldn't even bother trying to figure out how to add it.
So I suggest some type of button (maybe give an extra warning beforehand) that will allow one to easily the cert as being trusted.

IIUC, the whole purpose of this bug (and of a few others related to it) is that the Security gurus, in their infinite wisdom, have decreed that there MUST NOT be any possibility to click-through on a bad-certificate error, because it would "train" users into a "bad" conditioned reflex (i.e., clicking through a bad-cert error without reading), which, in turn, would open the way to all sorts of phishing (and similar) attacks. The bad-cert error page MUST be a dead end; there shall be a way to circumvent it, maybe even a "discoverable" one, but not easily. If this annoys the users, so much the better: it will incite the webmasters to clean up their act. And if some users abandon Firefox (a "safe" browser) for IE (an "unsafe" browser) in the process, it's their funeral.
So I guess you shouldn't expect any button next to that error message. At the most (IIUC) some more or less cryptic message telling users that, elsewhere, there exists a method to work around it.
Maybe I'm being overly sarcastic, but apart from that, the above is how I understand the matter. Please correct me, O Security people, if I'm wrong.

I see the security issue of it, but if you want to support "safe browsing" it would be wise, to somehow make the process easier, maybe click have a lock with an x around it, and the user must click that in order to continue. And possible asking if you sure you want to continue to an insecure site.
There are many people who want to have ssl (such as myself), but don't have $50-$200 to spare on ssl cert (hey that why we are running the servers out of our homes anyways)
There are many parts of my site that give https links on, and this would mean I would have to remove all of them, because my peers (no savvy computer users) would not bother to mess around with such a complicated process.
And if a small business has setup SSL on one or two LAN web servers, why would they spend a huge amount of money when a home made one can be made for free? And work just fine within the LAN.
The average user is just going to get \*\*\*\* of when they can't get the site thay want, they'll load up ie or whatever. They don't really know that firefox is safer than ie. Then people tell theirs friends/peers/coworkers, that firefox didn't work with XX website and its just a huge chain affect. But the big point/thing is that no matter how much you do or don't lock a user they'll just click on things without reading it. I can't tell you how many people I see just click ok on dialogs without even reading them. Users are going to be users, and they really is no point in restricting them that much.
Maybe we should mimic what IE7 does. I think IE gets the point across real well with a untrusted site. (First it gives you a screen telling you that the stie is not trusted, then it has check to bring you back to the page you came from, or it has a big red shield that says continue anyways (visually most people see the check and click on it). Also once you enter the untrusted site the url becomes read.

Camino nightly builds now use this gecko engine. There is no interface at all to add exceptions or certificates. I have multiple personal secure connections that I use externally due to not being able to ssh into my home system on many hotel networks, and my work uses self-signed certs for out internal computer connections. My secure email provider no longer works as my domain is not the same as the host's domain name that the cert is issued for. Camino nightly means no access.
I am amazed this conversation about trying to convince the developers to allow a means to add in the choice to do something the user wants to do is even taking place, especially considering that there seems to have been little if any discussion on taking away that choice!
I won't use ff (many reasons), I much prefer camino, but now I must choose another browser due to this. You can take away my choice to accept these certificates, but you cannot take away my choice to use another browser. And that means no more gecko engine for me, too.

Tyler: you need to file a bug on Camino and get them to add the necessary UI. (They may wish to provide an override in the mean time.)
For everyone else: I thought that we have an override mechanism (even if it's currently a bit obscure). Isn't that the case?

IIUC, there is -- intentionally -- no path from the error message (in a popup or error page) to the override mechanism (in some Certificate Properties dialog), which makes it more than "a bit" obscure. So obscure that, fom the above comments, it seems that many users failed to find the override mechanism when they needed it and, in desperation, went back to IE. (I wonder, though: shouldn't they have gone back to Fx2 instead? Or is this bug already fixed-on-branch?)

Thinking about it, I'm inclined to agree that the decision not to provide a direct link to the Add Security Exception dialog (on Windows, Tools > Options > Advanced > Encryption > View Certificates > Add Exception...) should be reconsidered. A button could be provided that opened the Certificate Manager at the Servers tab and the Add Security Exception dialog in front of it (and perhaps pre-filled the Server Location field?).
This which would mean that only five clicks would be required to actually see the site if the user is convinced that it's safe and wants to override (click on button on error page, Get Certificate, Confirm Security Exception, OK and then Reload); rather than up to 12 (!) steps at the moment. Also, I think that the text warning ("You are about to override how Firefox identifies sites. Legitimate banks, stores, and other public sites will not ask you to do this.") and yellow caution triangle on the Add Security Exception dialog are probably enough to warn casual users from adding an exception unless they're absolutely sure the site is safe. As a side-benefit, this approach would let admins and anybody else who's interested to actually see the invalid certificate in question; this is not easy at the moment (you have to get to the Add Security Exception dialog, type or paste in the address, click Get Certificate and then click View).

I did also propose a middle-ground solution ([bug 398718 comment 40](/show_bug.cgi?id=398718#c40 "RESOLVED FIXED - Better explanatory text for SSL error pages")) of "a direct link on the error page to a KB article on SUMO which would clearly illustrate how to add a security exception (and how to enable the pref to restore the per-page override option, if [bug 399275](/show_bug.cgi?id=399275 "RESOLVED FIXED - create preference which restores per-page SSL error override option for IT professionals") gets implemented)?"

This is only fixed on the trunk. The Fx 2 behavior hasn't changed.

I can think of a significant drawback to the new SSL error page. I use various Department of Defense websites for the US Army, and all use self-signed certificates. There are times when it is not possible to install the DoD certificate package, and this would require adding exceptions in the tens just to login and use a couple of sites.
I propose that a link be added to the error page that allows the request to go through, as IE7 features.
In addition, could the DoD be added to the Mozilla shipped CAs?

I find this change is quite the opposite of improvement for me. I do not need to provide justification why I would want to visit a site with a self-signed certificate. All that this change has done is caused me to search for hours for a way to get past the message. I found it, buried 8 clicks deep -- impressive, isn't it? Did some user actually ask for this functionality, or what prompted the developers to want to hold my hand and tell me what I do not want to do? Did someone ask - please make this harder for me, I am not competent enough to take decisions myself. Is the Gnome disease spreading here too?

I am very unhappy at the way FF3 deals with this issue currently (I just compiled from CVS to look for sure). The way Intranets/Extranets/Friendnets are cast into realms of evil borderline ways to use the Internet isn't very uplifting.
Some ideas. One is, revive fingerprints! This idea that noone is tech-savvy enough to handle fingerprints is insulting your users. If I hand out a physical piece of paper to all of my employees with a fingerprint on it, and tell them to absolutely make sure it is correct before selecting that "I swear I have checked that fingerprint" button, then they will do so. Even my mother would do so. If it's feasible and doesn't require a thousand "View Details" clicks, we're in business. So when CA-based certification fails, what about an "Authenticate by fingerprint" button? Why not display the technical details immediately?
I'd like to have full fingerprint authentication support for both CAs and single certificates. If you don't agree with me, make it a pref at least, so I can tell them what to change in about:config.
Another thing is, there are far too many CAs and sub-CAs that each one of us is supposed to trust. I'd like a pref that lets me consciously decide to accept a new certificate EVEN WHEN it is signed by a proper authority. When a certificate is replaced by a new one, I'd like to see the two in comparison. I understand this means keeping a certificate store of all certificates a user has seen. I would gladly invest the hard disk space for an enhanced knowledge of when, were and how certificates are changing.
I'll be hopefully looking out for cvs diffs! :D

I just played around with base64 encoding of fingerprint. Makes it easier to recognize. The less tedious, the more users are willing to pay attention. Additionally the awareness for security issues appears to me to be growing. Everyone I know is willing to invest a little into making his/her net experience safer. If that means comparing my bank's fingerprint code with a brochure, we'll do that, additionally to trusting one out of hundreds of CAs.
I also wondered if one could come up with a graphical/color encoding of a fingerprint the certificate data itself. Something that the human brain finds a lot easier to store and compare.
And finally the user should still have the option of just "using" some website after acknowledging, that its identity is not authenticated. Sometimes it's just completely unimportant.
Like.. okay, it's not safe. You told me, thanks, now let me take a peek. I promise I won't use my credit card here.

Hi Carlo,
I really appreciate you trying to be constructive with alternatives here, instead of just coming in and saying "this sucks." This bug is closed though, and has a long list of people who were watching the original, but may or may not be interested in the follow-on discussions.
I would therefore encourage you to open new bugs for individual ideas you have about improving things. They might not all get done, but at least they will be individually tracked, discussed, and evaluated that way.

Apologies for the bugspam, but just to clarify, when you run into a certificate error you \*do\* still have the option of "just using" the website by adding an exception.
And if you choose to set the about:config pref browser.ssl\_override\_behavior to 2, then it is only 3 more clicks to see the website after you have run into the certificate error (granted, it's 4 if you choose to make it only a temporary exception).

Sorry to comment on a closed bug, but I'm still seeing the occasional modal dialog -- on top of the new XUL error page.
------
Alert
www.example.com:443 uses an invalid security certificate.
The certificate is only valid for <a id="cert\_domain\_link" title="www.example2.com">www.example2.com</a>
(Error code: ssl\_error\_bad\_cert\_domain)
------
I've seen it probably 2 or 3 times over the last couple of weeks; I visit dozens of these sites a day, and with cert\_override.txt getting overwritten with every nightly update I often don't get to skip the warnings.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=452711#c0)  Josh Bressers    2008-06-24 15:33:24 UTC  ``` Mozilla developer John G. Myers reported a weakness in the trust model used by Mozilla regarding alternate names on self-signed certificates. A user could be prompted to accept a self-signed certificate from a website which includes alt-name entries. If the user accepted the certificate, they would also extend trust to any alternate domains listed in the certificate, despite not being prompted about the additional domains. This technique could be used by an attacker to impersonate another server.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=452711#c1)  Josh Bressers    2008-06-24 15:33:52 UTC  ``` This will be MFSA 2008-31   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=452711#c3)  Josh Bressers    2008-07-02 11:44:47 UTC  ``` This is now public: <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/known-vulnerabilities.html#firefox2.0.0.15>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=452711#c5)  Fedora Update System    2008-07-06 06:13:30 UTC  ``` devhelp-0.16.1-8.fc8, gtkmozembedmm-1.4.2.cvs20060817-21.fc8, yelp-2.20.0-10.fc8, gnome-web-photo-0.3-11.fc8, kazehakase-0.5.4-2.fc8.2, blam-1.8.3-16.fc8, epiphany-2.20.3-5.fc8, liferea-1.4.15-2.fc8, epiphany-extensions-2.20.1-8.fc8, galeon-2.0.4-3.fc8.3, openvrml-0.17.6-3.fc8, chmsee-1.0.0-2.31.fc8, ruby-gnome2-0.17.0-0.2.rc1.fc8, firefox-2.0.0.15-1.fc8, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-15.fc8, Miro-1.2.3-2.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) -

## Details

Various flaws were discovered in the browser engine. If a user had

Javascript enabled and were tricked into opening a malicious web

page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application

crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2798](/security/CVE-2008-2798), [CVE-2008-2799](/security/CVE-2008-2799))

It was discovered that Thunderbird would allow non-privileged XUL

documents to load chrome scripts from the fastload file if Javascript

was enabled. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary

Javascript code with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-2802](/security/CVE-2008-2802))

A flaw was discovered in Thunderbird that allowed overwriting trusted

objects via mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript(). If a user had

Javascript enabled and was tricked into opening a malicious web page,

an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2803](/security/CVE-2008-2803))

Daniel Glazman found that an improperly encoded .properties file in

an add-on can result in uninitialized memory being used. If a user

were tricked into installing a malicious add-on, Thunderbird may be

able to see data from other programs. ([CVE-2008-2807](/security/CVE-2008-2807))

John G. Myers discovered a weakness in the trust model used by

Thunderbird regarding alternate names on self-signed certificates.

If a user were tricked into accepting a certificate containing

alternate name entries, an attacker could impersonate another

server. ([CVE-2008-2809](/security/CVE-2008-2809))

A vulnerability was discovered in the block reflow code of

Thunderbird. If a user enabled Javascript, this vulnerability could

be used by an attacker to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2811](/security/CVE-2008-2811))

A flaw was discovered in the browser engine. A variable could be made

to overflow causing Thunderbird to crash. If a user enable Javascript

and was tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2785](/security/CVE-2008-2785))

Mozilla developers audited the MIME handling code looking for similar

vulnerabilities to the previously fixed [CVE-2008-0304](/security/CVE-2008-0304), and changed

several function calls to use safer versions of string routines.

Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2008-2798 CVE-2008-2799 CVE-2008-2800 CVE-2008-2801 CVE-2008-2802 CVE-2008-2803 CVE-2008-2805 CVE-2008-2807 CVE-2008-2808 CVE-2008-2809 CVE-2008-2811

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceweasel
webbrowser, an unbranded version of the Firefox browser. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-2798

    Devon Hubbard, Jesse Ruderman and Martijn Wargers discovered
    crashes in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-2799

    Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman and Gary Kwong discovered crashes in
    the Javascript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-2800

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

CVE-2008-2801

    Collin Jackson and Adam Barth discovered that Javascript code
    could be executed in the context or signed JAR archives.

CVE-2008-2802

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that XUL documements can escalate
    privileges by accessing the pre-compiled "fastload" file.

CVE-2008-2803

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that missing input sanitising in the
    mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript() function could lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code. Iceweasel itself is not affected, but
    some addons are.

CVE-2008-2805

    Claudio Santambrogio discovered that missing access validation in
    DOM parsing allows malicious web sites to force the browser to
    upload local files to the server, which could lead to information
    disclosure.

CVE-2008-2807

    Daniel Glazman discovered that a programming error in the code for
    parsing .properties files could lead to memory content being
    exposed to addons, which could lead to information disclosure.

CVE-2008-2808

    Masahiro Yamada discovered that file URLS in directory listings
    were insufficiently escaped.

CVE-2008-2809

    John G. Myers, Frank Benkstein and Nils Toedtmann discovered that
    alternate names on self-signed certificates were handled
    insufficiently, which could lead to spoofings secure connections.

CVE-2008-2811

    Greg McManus discovered discovered a crash in the block reflow
    code, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.15-0etch1.

Iceweasel from the unstable distribution (sid) links dynamically
against the xulrunner library.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel package.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0616)

## Topic

Updated thunderbird packages that fix a security issue are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Multiple flaws were found in the processing of malformed JavaScript
content. An HTML mail containing such malicious content could cause
Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user
running Thunderbird. (CVE-2008-2801, CVE-2008-2802, CVE-2008-2803)

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed HTML content. An
HTML mail containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2008-2785, CVE-2008-2798, CVE-2008-2799, CVE-2008-2811)

Several flaws were found in the way malformed HTML content was displayed.
An HTML mail containing specially-crafted content could, potentially, trick
a Thunderbird user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-2800)

Two local file disclosure flaws were found in Thunderbird. An HTML mail
containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to reveal the contents
of a local file to a remote attacker. (CVE-2008-2805, CVE-2008-2810)

A flaw was found in the way a malformed .properties file was processed by
Thunderbird. A malicious extension could read uninitialized memory,
possibly leaking sensitive data to the extension. (CVE-2008-2807)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird escaped a listing of local file
names. If a user could be tricked into listing a local directory containing
malicious file names, arbitrary JavaScript could be run with the
permissions of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2008-2808)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird displayed information about
self-signed certificates. It was possible for a self-signed certificate to
contain multiple alternate name entries, which were not all displayed to
the user, allowing them to mistakenly extend trust to an unknown site.
(CVE-2008-2809)

Note: JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird. The above
issues are not exploitable unless JavaScript is enabled.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; da-DK; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.8 (Ubuntu-feisty)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; da-DK; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.8 (Ubuntu-feisty)
Mozilla based browsers do not bind a user-approved webserver certificate to the originating domain name. This make the user vulnerable to certificate spoofing by "subjectAltName:dNSName"-extensions. Scenario:
(1) Assumed a phisher could redirect a user's browser to his prepared spoofing webserver (by MITM or DNS spoofing or domain hijacking or ...). But the spoofed webserver "www.paypal.com" uses a webserver cert signed by a browser-accredited CA, such that the user's browser would raise a "unknown CA" warning (that's what X.509 and TLS is all about!), so the phisher defers this step.
(2) The phisher creates a website "www.example.com" and a home brewed X.509 cert:
DN="CN=www.example.com"
subjectAltName:dNSName=www.example.com
subjectAltName:dNSName=www.paypal.com
and lures the user to <https://www.example.com/>. The user gets a "unknown CA" warning, but the "subjectAltName:dNSName" extensions are not shown to him (see [bug #238142](/show_bug.cgi?id=238142 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - server mismatch dialog doesn't show subject alt names (displays two identical domains as mismatched)")). As he does not plan to enter any relevant information, he accepts the cert (temporarily or permanently) and proceeds to download some pics.
(3) Any time later (if the cert got accepted temporarily this has to happen within the same session), the phisher lures the user to his spoofed <https://www.paypal.com/>, using the very same self-signed certificate. NO WARNING.
I consider this a severe cert-spoofing issue. Mozillas "match any wildcard"-behaviour ([bug #159483](/show_bug.cgi?id=159483 "RESOLVED FIXED - cert name matching: RFC 2818 vs. backwards compatibility (wildcards)")) makes it worse.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a X.509 cert with DN="CN=www.example.com", subjectAltName:dNSName="www.example.com" and subjectAltName:dNSName="www.example.net". Configure (virtual) https-hosts "www.example.com" and "www.example.net" using this cert.
2. Go to <<https://www.example.com/>>
3. Go to <<https://www.example.net/>>
Actual Results:
No warning in step 3
Expected Results:
Raise a warning like 'The webserver "www.example.net" presents a certificate issued by an unknown CA. You have already accepted this certificate, but for the domain name(s) "www.example.com". It is possible, though unlikely, that someone may be trying to intercept your communication with this web site. Do you want to accept this certificate for "www.example.net", too?'
Demonstration at <<http://test.eonis.net/>>

[Bug #159483](/show_bug.cgi?id=159483 "RESOLVED FIXED - cert name matching: RFC 2818 vs. backwards compatibility (wildcards)"): "cert name matching: RFC 2818 vs. backwards compatibility"
[Bug #238142](/show_bug.cgi?id=238142 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - server mismatch dialog doesn't show subject alt names (displays two identical domains as mismatched)"): "server mismatch dialog doesn't show subject alt names"

This is an old bug, already fixed in the forthcoming FireFox 3
It is not an NSS bug, so I will correct the product/component before
marking it fixed.Assignee: nobody → kengertGroup: securityComponent: Libraries → Security: PSMProduct: NSS → CoreQA Contact: libraries → psm

Association of certs with specific DNS names and ports was done as part

Thx.

[Bug #327181](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)") tracks the new PSM for FF3 (not yet part of 3.0a8). So this is a WONTFIX for FF2?
Check demo at <<http://test.eonis.net/>> before you answer ...

Yes, this is a wontfix for FF 2, because FF 2 has been released a year ago, and only gets fixes for critical issues. The fixes around [bug 327181](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)") are too big for a stable release.
While this bug is marked fixed for FF 3, please note the following:
If a user used FF 2 (or earlier) to import a certificate and accepted it permanently, this old decision will still apply when updating to FF 3.
FF 3 will not delete the old cert and stored trust.
In order to remove the global trust, users will have to take action and manually delete the old certificates, and use the new mechanism of FF 3 to create a new exception.

I'm astonished this issue is known for some time (at least to some moz devs) but considered non-critical (i strongly disagree).
So you won't mind me pushing this to the usual vuln-MLs, right?

[bug 327181](/show_bug.cgi?id=327181 "RESOLVED FIXED - Improve error reporting for invalid-certificate errors (error page for https, or combined dialog)") may have contained a fix, but it's a confusing bug to dupe this to. This is really [bug 308244](/show_bug.cgi?id=308244 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - insecure handling of SSL certificate extension field \"SubjectAltName\"") and [bug 240261](/show_bug.cgi?id=240261 "RESOLVED FIXED - [1.8 branch] peer-trusted certs can use alt names to spoof")Status: RESOLVED → UNCONFIRMEDResolution: DUPLICATE → ---

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird
an open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The
SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver production-quality
releases of code derived from the application formerly known as the
'Mozilla Application Suite'. XULRunner is a Mozilla runtime package
that can be used to bootstrap XUL+XPCOM applications like Firefox and
Thunderbird.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were reported in all mentioned Mozilla
products:

* TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative reported that an incorrect integer
  data type is used as a CSS object reference counter, leading to a
  counter overflow and a free() of in-use memory (CVE-2008-2785).
* Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman and Gary Kwong reported crashes in the
  JavaScript engine, possibly triggering memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-2799).
* Devon Hubbard, Jesse Ruderman, and Martijn Wargers reported crashes in
  the layout engine, possibly triggering memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-2798).
* moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that XUL documents that include a script from a
  chrome: URI that points to a fastload file would be executed with the
  privileges specified in the file (CVE-2008-2802).
* moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that the mozIJSSubScriptLoader.LoadScript()
  function only apply XPCNativeWrappers to scripts loaded from standard
  "chrome:" URIs, which could be the case in third-party add-ons
  (CVE-2008-2803).
* Astabis reported a crash in the block reflow implementation related to
  large images (CVE-2008-2811).
* John G. Myers, Frank Benkstein and Nils Toedtmann reported a weakness
  in the trust model used by Mozilla, that when a user accepts an SSL
  server certificate on the basis of the CN domain name in the DN field,
  the certificate is also regarded as accepted for all domain names in
  subjectAltName:dNSName fields (CVE-2008-2809).

The following vulnerabilities were reported in Firefox, SeaMonkey and
XULRunner:

* moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that the Same Origin Policy is not properly
  enforced on JavaScript (CVE-2008-2800).
* Collin Jackson and Adam Barth reported that JAR signing is not properly
  implemented, allowing injection of JavaScript into documents within a
  JAR archive (CVE-2008-2801).
* Opera Software reported an error allowing for arbitrary local file
  upload (CVE-2008-2805).
* Daniel Glazman reported that an invalid .properties file for an add-on
  might lead to the usage of uninitialized memory (CVE-2008-2807).
* Masahiro Yamada reported that HTML in "file://" URLs in directory
  listings is not properly escaped (CVE-2008-2808).
* Geoff reported that the context of Windows Internet shortcut files is
  not correctly identified (CVE-2008-2810).
* The crash vulnerability (CVE-2008-1380) that was previously announced
  in GLSA 200805-18 is now also also resolved in Seamonkey binary
  ebuilds.

The following vulnerability was reported in Firefox only:

* Billy Rios reported that the Pipe character in a command-line URI is
  identified as a request to open multiple tabs, allowing to open
  "chrome" and "file" URIs (CVE-2008-2933).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly
leading to the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service. It
is also possible for an attacker to trick a user to upload arbitrary
files or to accept an invalid certificate for a spoofed web site, to
read uninitialized memory, to violate Same Origin Policy, or to conduct
Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.
