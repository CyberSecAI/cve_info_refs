Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how Mozilla products (specifically Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey) handle self-signed certificates with alternative names. When a user accepts a self-signed certificate (or one with a mismatched domain) the browser would store this trust for all names presented in the certificate including alternative names (subjectAltName), not just the domain the user intended to trust.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Validation of Subject Alternative Names:** The primary weakness is that the browser's trust model didn't differentiate between the main subject name and the alternative subject names (subjectAltName) listed in a certificate. Accepting a cert for one domain implied trust for all listed alternative domains.
*   **Lack of User Visibility:** The user interface at the time did not clearly display the alternative names, making it difficult for users to understand the scope of the trust they were granting. The user interface only shows the certificate's common name, not all the alternate names.
*  **Global Trust:** The browser uses a single bit for trusting a cert for all of its subject names, not just the name the user intended to trust the cert for.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Certificate Spoofing:** A malicious actor could create a self-signed certificate for a benign domain but include an alternative name for a different, malicious site. If the user trusts the benign site they also automatically trust the malicious one.
*  **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** The attacker can use the accepted cert to impersonate another server and perform man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Bypass of Security Features:**  The ability to use trusted certificates for spoofed domains undermines the security assurances provided by SSL/TLS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker could intercept a connection to a legitimate site and present a malicious certificate with the real domain as a subject alternative name.
*   **Phishing:** An attacker lures a user to a malicious site with a self-signed cert with an alt name that is the target of the phishing attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Generate Certificates:** The attacker needs to be able to generate self-signed X.509 certificates.
*   **Ability to Intercept Connections or Redirect Traffic:**  The attacker needs to be able to intercept traffic to the target domain or redirect traffic to a malicious site under their control, and present the malicious certificate.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects all peer-trust areas, including SSL, S/MIME, and code signing.
*   The issue was known since at least April 2004.
*   The fix for Firefox 3 involved displaying all valid DNS names on error pages and binding overrides strictly to a single hostname and pair.
*   A fix for Firefox 2.x involved listing all the names from the cert in the error message.
*   The Debian Security Advisory DSA-1615-1 indicates that this vulnerability also affects Xulrunner and Iceweasel.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice USN-619-1 confirms that this issue affected Firefox.
*   Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2008:0547, RHSA-2008:0549, RHSA-2008:0569, RHSA-2008:0616 address this vulnerability.
*  The bug report on bugzilla.mozilla.org provides extensive discussions on how to solve this issue, and the chosen solution to display all names from the certificate on the error page.

In summary, CVE-2008-2809 highlights a certificate spoofing vulnerability resulting from insufficient handling of alternative names in self-signed certificates within Mozilla products. The fix involved not allowing to trust all names on the certificate, but only the name the user intended to trust.
