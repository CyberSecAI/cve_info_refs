- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `sitexs-0.1.1` CMS is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of user input. Specifically, the `user` parameter in the POST request to `/adm/index.php` is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, potentially leading to cookie theft. In this instance the attacker can steal the admin cookie.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to `/adm/index.php`, including the malicious JavaScript code in the `user` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable CMS.
