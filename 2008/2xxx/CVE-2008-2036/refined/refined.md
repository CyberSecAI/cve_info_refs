Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2008-2036:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw present in the `poll_id` parameter of the `index.php?p=poll` script within the Dream4 Koobi Pro 6.25 application.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the `poll_id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can potentially:
    *   Extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials (email and passwords).
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain unauthorized access to the application and underlying system depending on the database user permissions.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php?p=poll` with a malicious payload in the `poll_id` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
    *   No prior authentication is necessary to exploit the SQL Injection.
    *   The attacker needs to understand basic SQL syntax to craft their payload.

**Exploit Details (from Exploit-DB):**

The provided exploit is:
```
index.php?p=poll&showresult=1&poll_id=-1+union+select+concat(email,0x3a,pass),1,2,3+from+kpro_user
```
This payload is designed to:
1.  Use a negative value for `poll_id` to try and return an empty result set from the initial part of the union query.
2.  Use `UNION SELECT` to combine results from a crafted SELECT statement.
3.  Use the `concat()` function to combine the `email` and `pass` fields from the `kpro_user` table, separated by a colon, effectively exfiltrating user information.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit information is from Exploit-DB, which is a well-known source of vulnerability information and exploits.
* The provided dorks "allinurl: "index.php?p=poll"showresult" and "allinurl: poll_id "showresult"" can be used to find vulnerable installations using search engines.

**Summary**

The provided content from exploit-db clearly confirms the SQL injection vulnerability in Dream4 Koobi Pro 6.25, allowing for the extraction of sensitive data like user credentials via a crafted URL. This is consistent with what the CVE description would likely be for CVE-2008-2036.
