```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "BadBlue, a web server for peer-to-peer file sharing, stores several executable files (badblue.exe, uninst.exe, and dyndns.exe) in its web root directory by default. These executables can be launched remotely by any user.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Executable files are stored in the web root and are accessible to remote users.",
    "Lack of access controls on the executable files."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can repeatedly invoke the uninst.exe executable, creating a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote exploitation via HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the BadBlue web server."
