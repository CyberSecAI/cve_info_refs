{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the use of the `no-cache` HTTP 1.1 directive instead of the `no-store` directive in some versions of Outlook Web Access (OWA).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The use of `no-cache` allows browsers to store sensitive information in their cache, as long as they perform a successful revalidation with the origin server, this differs from `no-store` which prevents caching.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Sensitive information viewed during an OWA session can be stored on disk by web browsers.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by accessing the browser cache on a compromised system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need access to a system where a user has accessed Outlook Web Access, and be able to access browser cache."
