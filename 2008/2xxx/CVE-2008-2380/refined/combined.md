How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Courier Authentication Library: SQL Injection vulnerability — GLSA **200903-25**

An SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in the Courier
Authentication Library.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-libs/courier-authlib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.62.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.62.2** |

### Background

The Courier Authentication Library is a generic authentication API that
encapsulates the process of validating account passwords.

### Description

It has been reported that some parameters used in SQL queries are not
properly sanitized before being processed when using a non-Latin locale
Postgres database.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted input to an application
using the library, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary SQL
commands.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Courier Authentication Library users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/courier-authlib-0.62.2"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:18:26 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached tcl-8.3.3.ebuild and tk-8.3.3.ebuild.  These ebuilds accomplish the following:  1. split the tcl and tk packages into separate ebuilds. This makes writing ebuilds for packages that depend on tcl and/or tk much easier to handle (see expect-5.33.0.ebuild post and the vim-6.0-r2.ebuild patch attached).  I recommend putting the tcl ebuild under dev-lang/tcl and the tk ebuild under dev-tcltk/tk.   2. ebuilds are now version independent.   Renaming ebuilds to *-8.4.2.ebuild should work.  I have not tested this, but these ebuilds were based on the tcl-tk-8.4.2.ebuild.  3. The original tcl-tk-8.3.3.ebuild did not install the private headers and config.sh's for tcl and tk.  This is why vim-6.0-r2.ebuild did not work with 'use tcltk'  4. Promotes world peace and smells minty fresh.  Splitting up tcl and tk into separate ebuilds may cause some minor pain updating the dependencies of ebuilds that depend on them, but I think it is worth it in the long run.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:19:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 13](attachment.cgi?id=13 "tk-8.3.3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=13&action=edit "tk-8.3.3.ebuild")] tk-8.3.3.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Damon Conway (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-09 14:18:30 UTC  ``` Accepting as a real bug.  I'm testing the ebuilds out on my system. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Damon Conway (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-09 14:37:14 UTC  ``` It works for me, so I'm committing the ebuild. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-09 14:44:14 UTC  ``` Hi!  Some additional info that might be of use.  1. The expect ebuild ([bug 28](show_bug.cgi?id=28 "RESOLVED FIXED - expect-5.33.0.ebuild")) is a good test of a working tcl and tk installation. It depends on tcl-8.3* and tk-8.3*, but won't compile because the private headers are not installed by the current tcl-tk ebuild.  2. Contrary to my original comments, the submitted tcl-8.3.3 ebuild does not fix the vim --with-tcl problem.  It does allow vim to be compiled successfully using the --with-tcl configure flag and the resulting vim appears to run fine, however it doesn't pass the  VIMINIT='let OS = system("uname -s")' vim test that agriffis pointed out to me (see vim-6.0-r3.ebuild)  This appears to be an upstream vim issue.  tod ``` |  |
