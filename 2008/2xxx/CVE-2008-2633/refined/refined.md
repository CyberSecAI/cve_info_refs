Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2633

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `com_joomradio` component of Joomla. The component fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter when processing requests to `index.php`, specifically on the `show_radio` and `show_video` pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates unsanitized user input into SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially bypass authentication and access sensitive data, including usernames and password hashes stored in the `jos_users` table (or equivalent).
- **Data Modification:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Server Compromise:** In some scenarios, successful SQL injection can lead to server-side command execution, potentially resulting in complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting malicious GET requests to the Joomla application, specifically targeting the `com_joomradio` component.
- **Vulnerable parameters**: The `id` parameter is vulnerable on the `show_radio` and `show_video` pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Joomla instance.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs the ability to craft HTTP GET requests with a manipulated `id` parameter.
- **SQL knowledge:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL to craft effective injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable URLs:
  - `/index.php?option=com_joomradio&page=show_radio&id=[SQL Injection Payload]`
  - `/index.php?option=com_joomradio&page=show_video&id=[SQL Injection Payload]`
- Example Payload:
  -  `-1 UNION SELECT user(),concat(username,0x3a,password),user(),user(),user(),user(),user() FROM jos_users--`

This SQL injection vulnerability allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, by injecting crafted SQL queries into the `id` parameter of the URL. This is a serious vulnerability that could allow complete control over the application's data if exploited.
