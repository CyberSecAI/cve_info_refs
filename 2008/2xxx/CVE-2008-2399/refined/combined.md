| [vuln.sg](/)      | vuln.sg Vulnerability Research Advisory | | --- | | FireFTP add-on for FireFox Directory Traversal Vulnerability by Tan Chew Keong Release Date: 2008-05-19  [[en](fireftp0971-en.html)] [[jp](fireftp0971-jp.html)]  **Summary** A vulnerability has been found in [FireFTP add-on for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/684). When exploited, this vulnerability allows an anonymous attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on a Windows user's system.   **Tested Versions** * [FireFTP add-on for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/684) Version 0.97.1  The vulnerability is also confirmed in development version 0.98.20080405   **Details** This advisory discloses a vulnerability in the FireFTP add-on for Firefox. When exploited, this vulnerability allows an anonymous attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on a Windows user's system.  The FTP client does not properly sanitise filenames containing directory traversal sequences (**backslash**) that are received from an FTP server in response to the MLSD and LIST commands.  Examples of such responses from a malicious FTP server is shown below.  ```  Response to MLSD:  type=file;modify=20080227074710;size=20; \..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\testfile.txt\r\n  Response to LIST:  -rw-r--r--  1 502   502     4096 Mar 01 05:37 \..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\testfile.txt\r\n 			 ```   By tricking a user to download a directory from a malicious FTP server that contains files with backslash directory traversal sequences in their filenames, it is possible for the attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on a user's system with privileges of that user. An attacker can potentially leverage this issue to write files into a user's Startup folder and execute arbitrary code when the user logs on.   **POC / Test Code** Please download the POC [here](removed.html) and follow the instructions below.   **Instructions:**   1. Unzip the POC file into a directory. This gives FireFTPPOC.exe. 2. FireFTPPOC.exe is a POC FTP server that will send filenames with **backslash** directory traversal characters in response to MLSD and LIST commands. 3. Go to the command prompt and run FireFTPPOC.exe on a system. It will listen on FTP Port 21.   5. Ensure that FireFTP is configured to use **Passive** mode. 6. DISABLE **Remember Directory Listings** in FireFTP. 7. Use FireFTP from a **Windows** system to connect to the POC FTP server. You can use any username/password. 8. You'll see a directory named **/testdir** on the POC FTP server (see below).   10. If you traverse into that directory you'll see a file (**testfile.txt**) with directory traversal characters in its filename (see below).   12. Now, if you attempt to download the **/testdir** directory into **C:\aaaa\bbbb\cccc\etc**, you'll notice that **testfile.txt** will be written into **C:\** instead of into **C:\aaaa\bbbb\cccc\etc\testdir\testfile.txt**.   Hence, by tricking a user to download a directory from a malicious FTP server, an attacker can potentially leverage this issue to write files into a user's Startup folder and execute arbitrary code when the user logs on.      **Patch / Workaround** The vulnerability has been fixed in development version 0.98.20080518 and in release version 0.97.2. Code change in [CVS](http://www.mozdev.org/source/browse/fireftp/src/content/js/connection/controlSocket.js.in.diff?r1=1.58;r2=1.59;f=h).   **Disclosure Timeline** 2008-05-09 - Vulnerability Discovered. 2008-05-09 - Initial Vendor Notification. 2008-05-09 - Initial Vendor Reply. 2008-05-09 - Vulnerability Details Sent to Vendor. 2008-05-18 - Vendor fixes issue in development version and releases information on development website. 2008-05-19 - Public Release. 2008-05-22 - Received notification from vendor that vulnerability is fixed in release version 0.97.2. |      | Contact | | --- | | For further enquries, comments, suggestions or bug reports, simply email them to gs TOD nluv TA gnoek&#119ehc | ||

## FireFTP filename directory traversal sequence vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#906907

Original Release Date: 2008-05-21 | Last Revised: 2008-05-23

---

### Overview

The FireFTP Mozilla Firefox extension contains a vulnerability that may allow an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations.

### Description

| FireFTP is a Firefox extension that provides FTP client functionality. Firefox extensions can run with [Chrome privileges](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Chrome) which allow them to read/write local files and make network connections.  The FTP MLST command is defined in RFC [3659:](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3659) *MLST provides data about exactly the object named on its command line, and no others. MLSD, on the other, lists the contents of a directory if a directory is named, otherwise a 501 reply is returned.*The FTP LIST command is defined in RFC [959](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc959.html): *This command causes a list to be sent from the server to the passive DTP. If the pathname specifies a directory or other group of files, the server should transfer a list of files in the specified directory. If the pathname specifies a file then the server should send current information on the file. A null argument implies the user's current working or default directory.*FireFTP does not properly sanitise filenames containing directory traversal sequences that are received from an FTP server in response to the MLSD and LIST commands. To exploit this vulnerability, attacker would need need to convince a user to connect to an FTP server that then send malicious commands to FireFTP. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to write files to arbitrary locations on a system running Firefox with a vulnerable version of FireFTP. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Per the FireFTP [Developer Information](http://fireftp.mozdev.org/developers.html) page, this issue is addressed in the [0.97.2](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/684) and .99preview releases. Users are encouraged to upgrade to a fixed version. Users who have Firefox set to Automatically check for updates and Automatically download and install the update for Add-ons should be updated to a fixed version of FireFTP automatically. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**FTP proxy servers and IPS systems that include support for the FTP protocol may be able to block filenames that contain directory traversal sequences. Note that this workaround may not block all attack vectors.Since Firefox extensions usually run in the context of Firefox, host-based firewalls may not be able to detect the installation or presence of Firefox Add-ons such as FireFTP. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
