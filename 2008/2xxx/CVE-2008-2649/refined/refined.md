Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2649:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue. The `app_path` parameter in the URLs is vulnerable to file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application improperly handles the `app_path` parameter, allowing an attacker to include remote files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of exploitation is the ability to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server hosting the vulnerable application. An attacker can potentially gain full control of the server or use the server to spread malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests. Specifically, crafted URLs with a malicious `app_path` parameter are used to exploit the RFI vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker can be remote, meaning they do not need to be on the same network as the server.
- The attacker needs to have access to a server hosting a malicious file that can be included by the vulnerable application.

**Exploit Examples:**

The exploit examples provided show how to include an external file via the `app_path` parameter. The `SH3LL` is likely a placeholder for the attacker's malicious file which is located on their server.
