Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-2366:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an insecure relative RPATH (Run-Path) setting in the ELF headers of certain libraries within OpenOffice.org 1.1.x packages.
- Specifically, the RPATH was incorrectly set to `$ORIGIN` instead of `$ORIGIN`, which has a different interpretation by the dynamic linker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure RPATH: The incorrect RPATH setting allows the dynamic linker to search for libraries in the current working directory of the application, rather than the intended location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious libraries and placing them in a directory of their choosing, then convincing a victim to run OpenOffice.org from that directory. This would result in the attacker's malicious libraries being loaded instead of the legitimate ones, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Attack: The attack requires local access to the system.
- User Interaction: The attacker needs to convince the victim to execute the vulnerable OpenOffice.org application from a directory controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user account on the target system.
- Ability to create files and directories.
- Ability to convince a victim to execute OpenOffice.org from a crafted directory.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenOffice.org 1.1.x packages as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.
- This issue was addressed in Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2008:0538.
