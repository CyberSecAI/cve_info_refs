{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2008-2962",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `view`, `id`, and `s` parameters in `index.php`, `member.php` and `post.php`, respectively. Also, unsanitized user input in the `s` and `sort` parameters in `index.php` and the `id` parameter in `post.php` leads to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to bypass authentication, gain access to sensitive data (username and password), and possibly modify data. Successful exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable scripts with crafted SQL injection payloads in URL parameters.",
         "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable scripts with crafted XSS payloads in URL parameters."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker needs to have a web browser to trigger XSS.",
        "additional_details": "Magic quotes must be off for SQL injection exploitation."
