```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses user-supplied input from the 'action' parameter in the 'entry.php' script to construct a file path for inclusion without proper sanitization, leading to Local File Inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server by manipulating the 'action' parameter. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as source code, configuration files, or system files (e.g., /etc/passwd).",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to 'entry.php' with a malicious 'action' parameter containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and needs to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application."
