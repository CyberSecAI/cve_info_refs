{
  "CVE-2008-2248": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is a result of Outlook Web Access (OWA) for Exchange Server not sufficiently validating HTML when rendering e-mail from within an individual OWA client session.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could gain access to an individual clientâ€™s OWA session data, allowing elevation of privilege. The attacker could then perform any action the user could perform from within OWA, such as reading, sending, and deleting e-mail as the logged-on user.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker would have to convince a user to open a specially crafted e-mail that would run malicious script from within an individual OWA client.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious email and convince the victim to open it via their OWA session."
