Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2815

**Vulnerability:** Blind SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists in the MyMarket 1.72 application due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `index.php` file. Specifically, the application does not properly handle unexpected values or SQL code within the `id` parameter when querying the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection, where the attacker cannot see the results of the SQL queries directly. Instead, they must infer the results based on the application's behavior. This is evident from the exploit script which uses the presence or absence of "None" in the response to determine if the injected SQL query is true or false.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper input sanitization or validation for the `id` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and password hashes. The exploit specifically targets the `users` table to retrieve login credentials.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Although not explicitly demonstrated in the provided exploit, the vulnerability can potentially be used to modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file, using the `id` parameter.
*   **Manipulated Category ID:** The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL to inject SQL queries.
    *   Example: `http://[target]/[path]/?id=[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable MyMarket application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker must understand how to construct SQL injection queries to extract the desired information.
*   **Valid Category ID (initial):** The exploit requires a valid initial category id to perform SQL injection
