  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "BGP implementations do not properly handle specially crafted BGP UPDATE messages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of crafted BGP UPDATE messages leading to dropped sessions."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) due to dropped BGP sessions, potentially leading to routing instability (route flapping).",

      "Injection of specially crafted BGP UPDATE messages into an existing BGP session.",
