Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-2519:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Core FTP client does not properly sanitize filenames received from an FTP server in response to the `LIST` command. Specifically, it fails to handle directory traversal sequences (`\` and `/`) within filenames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The client is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks due to the lack of sanitization of filenames received from the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the user's system. This is achieved by sending specially crafted filenames with directory traversal sequences via a malicious FTP server.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By writing files into a user's Startup folder, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution when the user logs on. This allows the attacker to run malicious code on the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious FTP Server:** The attacker sets up a malicious FTP server.
*   **LIST Command Manipulation:** The attacker crafts filenames with directory traversal sequences in the response to the `LIST` command.
*   **User Interaction:** The user connects to the malicious FTP server and attempts to download a directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control an FTP server.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into connecting to the malicious FTP server and downloading a directory.
*   The attacker does not require prior authentication or knowledge of the systemâ€™s file system structure, beyond knowing paths such as a user's Startup folder.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects both `Core FTP LE` and `Core FTP Pro` version 2.1 build 1565
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.1 build 1568
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Tan Chew Keong.
*   Proof of concept (POC) code is available and described in the advisory (although the actual code is not included in this document).

The advisory also provides a clear timeline of the disclosure process.
