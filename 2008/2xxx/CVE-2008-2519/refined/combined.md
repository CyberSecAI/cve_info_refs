How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [vuln.sg](/)      | vuln.sg Vulnerability Research Advisory | | --- | | Core FTP FTP-Client Directory Traversal Vulnerability by Tan Chew Keong Release Date: 2008-05-23  [[en](coreftp211565-en.html)] [[jp](coreftp211565-jp.html)]  **Summary** A vulnerability has been found in [Core FTP FTP-client](http://www.coreftp.com/). When exploited, this vulnerability allows an anonymous attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on a Windows user's system.   **Tested Versions** * [Core FTP LE](http://www.coreftp.com/)  Version 2.1 Build 1565 * [Core FTP Pro](http://www.coreftp.com/) Version 2.1 Build 1565   **Details** This advisory discloses a vulnerability in Core FTP FTP-client. When exploited, this vulnerability allows an anonymous attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on a Windows user's system.  The FTP client does not properly sanitise filenames containing directory traversal sequences **(backslash and forward-slash)** that are received from an FTP server in response to the LIST command.  Examples of such responses from a malicious FTP server is shown below.  ```  Response to LIST (backslash):  -rw-r--r--  1 502   502     4096 Mar 01 05:37 \..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\testfile.txt\r\n  Response to LIST (forward slash):  -rw-r--r--  1 502   502     4096 Mar 01 05:37 /../../../../../../../../../testfile.txt\r\n  			 ```  By tricking a user to download a directory from a malicious FTP server that contains files with **backslash or forward-slash directory traversal sequences in their filenames**, it is possible for the attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on a user's system with privileges of that user. An attacker can potentially leverage this issue to write files into a user's Startup folder and execute arbitrary code when the user logs on.   **POC / Test Code** Please download the POC [here](removed.html) and follow the instructions below.   **Instructions:**   1. Unzip the POC file into a directory. This gives CoreFTPPOC.exe and CoreFTPPOC-forward.exe. 2. **CoreFTPPOC.exe** and **CoreFTPPOC-forward.exe** are POC FTP servers that will send filenames with directory traversal characters in response to LIST commands. 3. **CoreFTPPOC.exe** sends filenames with **backslash** directory traversal characters, whereas **CoreFTPPOC-forward.exe** sends filenames with **forward-slash** traversal characters. 4. Go to the command prompt and run CoreFTPPOC.exe or CoreFTPPOC-forward.exe on a system. It will listen on FTP Port 21.   6. Ensure that CoreFTP is configured to use **Passive** mode. 7. Use CoreFTP to connect to the POC FTP server. You can use any username/password. 8. You'll see a directory named **/testdir** on the POC FTP server (see below).   10. If you traverse into that directory you'll see a file (**testfile.txt**) with directory traversal characters in its filename (see below).   12. Now, if you attempt to download the **/testdir** directory into **C:\aaaa\bbbb\cccc\etc**, you'll notice that **testfile.txt** will be written into **C:\** instead of into **C:\aaaa\bbbb\cccc\etc\testdir\testfile.txt**.   Hence, by tricking a user to download a directory from a malicious FTP server, an attacker can potentially leverage this issue to write files into a user's Startup folder and execute arbitrary code when the user logs on.      **Patch / Workaround** The vulnerability has been fixed in Version 2.1 Build 1568.   **Disclosure Timeline** 2008-05-15 - Vulnerability Discovered. 2008-05-15 - Initial Vendor Notification. 2008-05-15 - Initial Vendor Reply. 2008-05-15 - Vulnerability Details Sent to Vendor. 2008-05-22 - Vendor Releases Fixed Version. 2008-05-23 - Public Release. |      | Contact | | --- | | For further enquries, comments, suggestions or bug reports, simply email them to gs TOD nluv TA gnoek&#119ehc | ||
