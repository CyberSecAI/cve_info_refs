Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the "DownloaderActiveX" control of C6 Messenger. This ActiveX control has insecure methods that allows arbitrary file downloads and execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe ActiveX Control:** The core issue is the insecure design of the ActiveX control, which allows remote file downloads and execution without proper security checks.
- **Lack of Host Check:** The `propDownloadUrl` property accepts any URL, including local URLs, effectively bypassing internet zone restrictions.
- **Unrestricted Execution:** The `propPostDownloadAction` property allows arbitrary execution of the downloaded file.
- **No Security Restrictions:** The ActiveX control is not marked as "Safe for Script" or "Safe for Init," but it is marked "Safe for untrusted: caller, data", however this is not enough to prevent exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can download and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to gain control of the user's computer.
- **Malware Installation:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to install malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a malicious webpage. If a user visits a page containing the malicious ActiveX object, the code can be downloaded and executed.
- **Phishing:** Attackers can use phishing emails to lure users to a malicious webpage containing the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Position:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without needing physical access to the victim's machine.
- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage or have control over a website that victims might visit.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** Attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable ActiveX control's CLSID to craft an exploit.
- **Victim Using IE:** The exploit is triggered when a user visits the malicious webpage using Internet Explorer.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided exploit code demonstrates the ease of exploiting this vulnerability. By simply changing the `propDownloadUrl` to a malicious file and setting `propPostDownloadAction` to "run", an attacker can execute arbitrary code.
- The exploit code also highlights that no host check is performed, allowing the attacker to use local urls and bypass internet zone restrictions.
- The exploit leverages the ActiveX control's lack of security to download and execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

This is a clear case of arbitrary code execution due to an insecure ActiveX control. The details provided on Exploit-DB offer a good understanding of how the exploit works.
