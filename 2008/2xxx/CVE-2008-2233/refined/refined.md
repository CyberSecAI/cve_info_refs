Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2233

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the openwsman client that allows for an SSL session replay attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SSL Session Replay:** The client is susceptible to a replay attack, potentially allowing an attacker to reuse previously captured, valid SSL session data to gain unauthorized access or perform actions on behalf of the legitimate user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access/Actions:** A successful session replay attack can allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate client, potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources or executing actions they are not authorized to perform.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing/Interception:** The attacker would need to intercept or sniff the initial SSL session data between a legitimate openwsman client and a server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The attacker must be positioned on the network to intercept the communication between the client and server.
- **Network Access:** They need network access to the target system and network traffic related to the vulnerable application.
- **Session Data Capture:** The attacker needs the ability to capture and replay the SSL session information.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specifically related to the *client* side of the openwsman implementation, indicating a client-side flaw.
- The provided security advisory mentions that the impact of this vulnerability on the client depends on the specific configuration. This suggests some configurations may be more vulnerable than others.
- The advisory includes remediation steps for openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0, which includes updating the openwsman package and restarting the daemon.
- This vulnerability is addressed by the openwsman package update described in the security advisory, indicating a patch is available for affected systems.
