Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the `search.php` file of the Pre Shopping Mall 1.1 application. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, allowing for SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Specifically, the `search` parameter in the `search.php` file is vulnerable.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database, including administrator credentials (usernames and passwords).
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the administration panel.
    *   Potentially perform other malicious actions depending on the database access granted to the application.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface, specifically the `search.php` file. The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query within the `search` parameter.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
    *   No special privileges are required.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the application and modify the `search` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
*   The extracted information provides a specific SQL injection payload that can be used to retrieve admin credentials: `http://site.com/emall/search.php?search='/**/and/**/1=2/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,3,CONCAT(login,0x3a,password),5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16/**/FROM/**/admin/*`
*   The admin credentials are stored in plaintext in the database.
*   The injection can extract multiple rows from the table, potentially revealing all admin accounts.
* The admin login page is located at `/admin/`.
