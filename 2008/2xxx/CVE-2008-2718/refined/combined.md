Dear users of TYPO3,
It has been discovered that the default value of the TYPO3 configuration variable fileDenyPattern allows arbitrary code execution on Apache web servers. Besides that, the library fe\_adminlib.inc allows Cross Site Scripting (XSS).
=== Component Type ===
TYPO3 Core
=== Affected Versions ===
TYPO3 versions 3.x, 4.0 to 4.0.7, 4.1 to 4.1.6, 4.2
=== Vulnerability Types ===
Arbitrary code execution on Apache, Cross Site Scripting
=== Vulnerability #1 ===
Default value of fileDenyPattern allows arbitrary code execution on Apache
=== Severity ===
High
=== Problem Description ===
Because of a not sufficiently secure default value of the TYPO3 configuration variable fileDenyPattern, TYPO3 is susceptible to the following vulnerabilities when running on Apache web server:
1. Authenticated backend users with granted access to an arbitrary filemount are able to upload Apache configuration files (.htaccess). A malicious backend user may abuse this to create and execute files containing arbitrary code.
2. If the Apache module mod\_mime is enabled on the Apache web server (default case), authenticated backend users with granted access to an arbitrary filemount can upload/create and execute arbitrary files with PHP code. The same applies to frontend users in the case that TYPO3 extensions with frontend plugins rely on t3lib\_div::verifyFilenameAgainstDenyPattern() to check the validity of the file name. The TYPO3 security team is aware of a number of popular TYPO3 extensions that use this method. Besides that, TYPO3 extensions that process file uploads using the method processFiles() of the core library fe\_adminLib.inc would also be vulnerable. The TYPO3 Security Team is not aware of an existing TYPO3 extension within the TYPO3 extension repository (TER) that uses the method processFiles().
=== Solution ===
Update to the TYPO3 versions 4.1.7 or 4.2.1 that fix the issues described. The new versions contain an updated default value for fileDenyPattern. If this default value is not used, there will be a warning displayed in backend module "About modules". This should remind the administrator to change the value of fileDenyPattern.
If you can't update directly, change the value of the configuration variable fileDenyPattern to the following value:
\.php[3456]?(\..\*)?$|^\.htaccess$
This can be achieved by either changing the value of fileDenyPattern in the section "All configuration" within the TYPO3 install tool or by adding the line
$GLOBALS['TYPO3\_CONF\_VARS']['BE']['fileDenyPattern']='\.php[3456]?(\..\*)
?$|^\.htaccess$';
to the end of the TYPO3 configuration file typo3conf/localconf.php.
=== Background ===
To prevent backend and frontend users from uploading arbitrary PHP scripts through TYPO3 core features, each file operation (upload, creation, rename, copy, move) includes a check of the file name against the configuration variable fileDenyPattern. (Furthermore, there are more checks done using the contents of the array $TYPO3\_CONF\_VARS['BE']['fileExtensions'] which are not discussed here because they are not related to the problem.)
The previous value of fileDenyPattern allows to create and upload files with multiple extensions where 'php' doesn't necessarily has to be the last extension. In the case of a file with an unknown mime type the Apache module mod\_mime may search for other known extensions in the file name and handle the file according to the first known extension found.
Further advice can be found in the blog entry Advice on core security issue regarding fileDenyPattern on buzz.typo3.org. There we try to describe a number of basic steps concerning how to check your TYPO3 website for the presence of a possible manipulation and how to change Apache's handling of multiple extensions.
=== Vulnerability #2 ===
fe\_adminlib.inc allows Cross Site Scripting
=== Severity ===
Low
=== Problem Description ===
User input processed by fe\_adminlib.inc is not being properly filtered to prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. A TYPO3 based website will not be vulnerable to this flaw, as long as there is no frontend extension in use, that is based on fe\_adminlib.inc. Popular TYPO3 extensions that use fe\_adminlib.inc are:
\* direct\_mail\_subscription
\* feuser\_admin
\* kb\_md5fepw
=== Solution ===
Update to the TYPO3 versions 4.1.7 or 4.2.1 that fix the issues described.
=== Background ===
This is a different XSS issue within fe\_adminlib.inc as reported in Security Bulletin TYPO3-20061010-1.
=== General advice ===
Follow the recommendations that are given in the TYPO3 Security Cookbook [1]. Please subscribe to the typo3-announce mailing list [2] to receive future Security Bulletins via E-mail. All TYPO3 Security Bulletins are available at the Security Team pages on typo3.org [3].
=== Credits ===
Credits go to Michiel Roos and Marcus Krause who both reported issue #1 to us and to Christian Seifert, Jeroen van Iddekinge and Arnd Messer who reported issue #2 to us. The TYPO3 Security Team also wishes to thank the Security Team members Marcus Krause and Henning Pingel for fixing the issues in cooperation with the core team members Ingo Renner, Ingmar Schlecht and Michael Stucki.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1596-1                  security@debian.org

Package        : typo3
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian Bug     : 485814

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the
TYPO3 content management framework.

Because of a not sufficiently secure default value of the TYPO3
configuration variable fileDenyPattern, authenticated backend users
could upload files that allowed to execute arbitrary code as the
webserver user.

User input processed by fe_adminlib.inc is not being properly filtered
to prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which is exposed when
specific plugins are in use.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2+debian-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your typo3 package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# TYPO3-20080611-1: Multiple vulnerabilities in TYPO3 Core

Categories:
[TYPO3 CMS](/help/security-advisories/typo3-cms "TYPO3 CMS")

It has been discovered that the default value of the TYPO3 configuration variable fileDenyPattern allows arbitrary code execution on Apache web servers. Besides that, the library fe\_adminlib.inc allows Cross Site Scripting (XSS).

**Component Type:** TYPO3 Core

**Affected Versions:** TYPO3 versions 3.x, 4.0 to 4.0.8, 4.1 to 4.1.6, 4.2.0

**Vulnerability Types:** Arbitrary code execution on Apache, Cross Site Scripting

**Vulnerability #1: Default value of fileDenyPattern allows arbitrary code execution on Apache**

**Severity:** High

**Problem Description:** Because of a not sufficiently secure default value of the TYPO3 configuration variable fileDenyPattern, TYPO3 is susceptible to the following vulnerabilities when running on Apache web server:

1. Authenticated backend users with granted access to an arbitrary filemount are able to upload Apache configuration files ([.htaccess](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/htaccess.html)). A malicious backend user may abuse this to create and execute files containing arbitrary code.
2. If the Apache module [mod\_mime](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_mime.html) is enabled on the Apache web server (default case), authenticated backend users with granted access to an arbitrary filemount can upload/create and execute arbitrary files with PHP code. The same applies to frontend users in the case that TYPO3 extensions with frontend plugins rely on  t3lib\_div::verifyFilenameAgainstDenyPattern() to check the validity of the file name. The TYPO3 security team is aware of a number of popular TYPO3 extensions that use this method. Besides that, TYPO3 extensions that process file uploads using the method processFiles() of the core library fe\_adminLib.inc would also be vulnerable. The TYPO3 Security Team is not aware of an existing TYPO3 extension within the TYPO3 extension repository (TER) that uses the method processFiles().

**Solution:** Update to the TYPO3 versions 4.0.9, 4.1.7 or 4.2.1 that fix the issues described. The new versions contain an updated default value for fileDenyPattern. If this default value is not used, there will be a warning displayed in backend module "About modules". This should remind the administrator to change the value of fileDenyPattern.

If you can't update directly, change the value of the configuration variable fileDenyPattern to the following value:

\.php[3456]?(\..\*)?$|^\.htaccess$

This can be achieved by either changing the value of fileDenyPattern in the section "All configuration" within the TYPO3 install tool or by adding the line

$GLOBALS['TYPO3\_CONF\_VARS']['BE']['fileDenyPattern']='\.php[3456]?(\..\*)?$|^\.htaccess$';

to the end of the TYPO3 configuration file typo3conf/localconf.php.

**Background:** To prevent backend and frontend users from uploading arbitrary PHP scripts through TYPO3 core features, each file operation (upload, creation, rename, copy, move) includes a check of the file name against the configuration variable fileDenyPattern. (Furthermore, there are more checks done using the contents of the array $TYPO3\_CONF\_VARS['BE']['fileExtensions'] which are not discussed here because they are not related to the problem.)

The previous value of fileDenyPattern allows to create and upload files with multiple extensions where 'php' doesn't necessarily has to be the last extension. In the case of a file with an unknown mime type the Apache module [mod\_mime](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_mime.html) may search for other known extensions in the file name and handle the file according to the first known extension found.

Further advice can be found in the blog entry [Advice on core security issue regarding fileDenyPattern](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/advice-on-core-security-issue-regarding-filedenypattern/) on buzz.typo3.org. There we try to describe a number of basic steps concerning how to check your TYPO3 website for the presence of a possible manipulation and how to change Apache's handling of multiple extensions.

**Vulnerability #2:** **fe\_adminlib.inc allows** **Cross Site Scripting**

**Severity:** Low

**Problem Description:** User input processed by fe\_adminlib.inc is not being properly filtered to prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. A TYPO3 based website will not be vulnerable to this flaw, as long as there is no frontend extension in use, that is based on fe\_adminlib.inc. Popular TYPO3 extensions that use fe\_adminlib.inc are:

* direct\_mail\_subscription
* feuser\_admin
* kb\_md5fepw

**Solution:** Update to the TYPO3 versions 4.0.9, 4.1.7 or 4.2.1 that fix the issues described.

 **Background:** This is a different XSS issue within fe\_adminlib.inc as reported in Security Bulletin [TYPO3-20061010-1](/quicklinks/editors-guide/content-elements/form-elements).

**General advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 SECURITY Guide](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SecurityGuide). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce mailing list](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce)  to receive future Security Bulletins via E-mail.

**Credits:** Credits go to Michiel Roos and Marcus Krause who both reported issue #1 to us and to Christian Seifert, Jeroen van Iddekinge and Arnd Messer who reported issue #2 to us. The TYPO3 Security Team also wishes to thank the Security Team members Marcus Krause and Henning Pingel for fixing the issues in cooperation with the core team members Ingo Renner, Ingmar Schlecht and Michael Stucki.
