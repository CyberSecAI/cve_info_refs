Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-2718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

1.  **Insecure Default `fileDenyPattern`:** The primary root cause is an insufficiently secure default value for the `fileDenyPattern` configuration variable in TYPO3. This variable is meant to prevent users from uploading malicious files but was not restrictive enough. Specifically, it did not properly block files with multiple extensions where 'php' was not the last extension and .htaccess files.

2.  **XSS in `fe_adminlib.inc`:** The `fe_adminlib.inc` library does not properly filter user input, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The insecure `fileDenyPattern` allows authenticated backend users (with sufficient privileges) to upload files that can execute arbitrary code on the Apache server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the web server. This occurs due to:
    *   Uploading `.htaccess` files to manipulate Apache configuration.
    *   Uploading files with multiple extensions that are parsed by the Apache `mod_mime` module, allowing execution of embedded PHP code.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper input filtering in `fe_adminlib.inc` exposes the application to XSS vulnerabilities if a TYPO3 extension that uses fe_adminlib.inc is in use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Arbitrary Code Execution:**
    *   Full system compromise is possible because the attacker can execute arbitrary code as the webserver user.
    *   Data breach or manipulation, malware implantation
    *   Denial of service
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting:**
    *   Session hijacking through malicious scripts injected into the webpage.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Defacement of the webpage.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Arbitrary Code Execution:**
    *   Authenticated backend users with access to file mounts can upload malicious files.
    *   Frontend users using vulnerable extensions relying on `t3lib_div::verifyFilenameAgainstDenyPattern()` are also vulnerable.
    *  Frontend users utilizing TYPO3 extensions processing file uploads using the `processFiles()` method of `fe_adminLib.inc`

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting:**
    *   Attackers inject malicious scripts through user inputs that are not sanitized by `fe_adminlib.inc`
    *   This attack is only possible through vulnerable extensions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Arbitrary Code Execution:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated backend user with permissions to upload files to the server.
    *   For some scenarios frontend user interaction with vulnerable extensions could also trigger the vulnerability.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting:**
    *   The attacker needs to inject malicious scripts through a vulnerable extension of TYPO3 that uses the `fe_adminlib.inc` library.
    *   The user has to visit a crafted link or a website including the malicious script.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory indicates that several TYPO3 versions were affected (3.x, 4.0 to 4.0.7, 4.1 to 4.1.6, 4.2).
*   The vulnerability was fixed in TYPO3 versions 4.0.9, 4.1.7, and 4.2.1 with an updated `fileDenyPattern`.
*   The recommended `fileDenyPattern` is: `\.php[3456]?(\..\*)?$|^\.htaccess$`.
*  Several TYPO3 extensions were known to be vulnerable to the XSS flaw such as `direct_mail_subscription`, `feuser_admin`, `kb_md5fepw`
