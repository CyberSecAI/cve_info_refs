Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `members.php` page of the Battle.net Clan Script. Specifically, the script doesn't properly sanitize the `showmember` parameter passed via the GET method, which is then directly used in a SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection. The application directly uses user-supplied input in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can:
    *   Extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., usernames, password hashes, email addresses).
    *   Potentially modify or delete data in the database (though this is not explicitly demonstrated in the provided exploit).
    *   Gain further access or control over the system (depending on database configuration and user permissions).
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `members.php` page with a crafted `showmember` parameter containing malicious SQL code.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Battle.net Clan Script. No special privileges or pre-existing access is needed, making this a remote vulnerability.

The exploit provided in the content specifically targets retrieving the admin user's username and password hash by using a `UNION SELECT` statement within the injected SQL.
