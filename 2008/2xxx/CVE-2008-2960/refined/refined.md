  "CVE-2008-2960": {
    "description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in phpMyAdmin before 2.11.7 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors when register_globals is enabled and .htaccess has no effect.",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in some scripts within the /libraries directory.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions if the user interacts with the injected code.",
          "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves injecting malicious script or HTML via unspecified parameters to the vulnerable phpMyAdmin scripts in the /libraries directory.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the phpMyAdmin application and inject malicious code in the vulnerable parameters. The phpMyAdmin installation must have PHP's register_globals setting enabled, and the webserver must not apply the settings contained in the .htaccess file that phpMyAdmin provides in the /libraries folder, since the .htaccess file mitigates this flaw. In other words, the server needs to be misconfigured for the exploit to work."

     "affected_versions": "Versions prior to 2.11.7",
     "fix_versions": "Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.11.7 or newer."
