Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2265

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `news.php` script of EMO Realty Manager.
*   The `ida` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (username and password hashes).
*   **Database Manipulation:** Depending on the database user's permissions, an attacker might be able to modify or delete data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  The provided exploit specifically targets the `members` table and notes that the admin has an ID of 1. This suggests that the attacker could potentially retrieve admin credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted URL using the `ida` parameter in a GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable web application and does not need to be locally present on the server.
*   **Basic Web Exploitation Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the SQL injection payload, making this a relatively low-skill attack to execute, although finding the exact vulnerability point will require knowledge of the application.

**Exploit Code:**
* The provided exploit example shows how to extract member information including user ids, names, and password hashes:
`http://target.com/path/pages/news.php?ida=-1/**/union/**/select/**/1,2,concat_ws(0x3a3a,id,member_name,member_password),4/**/from/**/members/*`
* This demonstrates the SQL injection using a union based select query to select from the `members` table. The `concat_ws` function allows to combine multiple fields to be returned in one column.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit code provides a live demo link showcasing the vulnerability at `http://sellrentcanada.com/aaa/pages/news.php?ida=-1/**/union/**/select/**/1,2,concat_ws(0x3a3a,id,member_name,member_password),4/**/from/**/members/*`
* The author indicates that admin info is stored with id number 1, suggesting that extracting this record is a priority for privilege escalation.
* The vulnerability is present in the `news.php` page of the EMO Realty Manager application.
