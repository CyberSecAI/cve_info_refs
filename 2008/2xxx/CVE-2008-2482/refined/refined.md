    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-2482",
      "description": "OneCMS 2.5 has a Local File Inclusion vulnerability in the install_mod.php script.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. The 'load' parameter from the GET request is not properly validated before being used in an include statement.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
            "Improper Input Validation"
        ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files from the server within the context of the web application. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure, such as the contents of configuration files, application source code, or even system files like /etc/passwd.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attacker can send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable install_mod.php script, manipulating the 'load' parameter to include files outside the intended directory.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No specific authentication or authorization is required.",
       "additional_details": "The code attempts to validate the 'load' parameter by checking if it is not numeric and if the file type is PHP. However, the vulnerability exists because the code does not properly sanitize the file path before using it in the include statement, allowing path traversal."
