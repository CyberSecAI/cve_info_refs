Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the `cat_id` parameter in the `index.php` script, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where attacker-controlled input is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (usernames, passwords, emails) as demonstrated in the provided exploit.
- **Potential for further compromise:** In some cases SQL injection vulnerabilities can be leveraged to gain further access to the server by potentially executing system level commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed through a specially crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the `cat_id` parameter within the query string of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the appropriate injection payload.
- **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit string demonstrates the use of a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to inject malicious SQL code:

```
index.php?page=category&cat_id=-9999+union+all+select+1,concat(user,char(58),passw ,char(58),email),3,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,11,null +from+users--
```

This SQL injection attempts to:
1.  Force the original query to return no rows by setting `cat_id` to `-9999`.
2.  Use `UNION ALL` to append a new result set, which is controlled by the attacker.
3.  Select the `user`, `passw`, and `email` columns from the `users` table, concatenating them with colons as separators.

This exploit successfully retrieves data from the `users` table, which includes user credentials.
