Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-2136, extracted from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a memory leak within the Simple Internet Transition (SIT) code used for IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels in the Linux kernel. This is due to a problem in how SIT IPv6 tunnel handling is done.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Memory Leak:** The SIT code does not properly manage memory allocation, leading to a leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service. Specifically, the memory leak can lead to the system running out of memory and crashing or hanging.
*   **System Crash**: Some sources specifically mention that the machine can be crashed "immediately."

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specific packets related to IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the target system, specifically crafted IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel traffic.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
*   Multiple sources mention this is a "remote" vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple Linux distributions, including Debian, openSUSE, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
*   Some vendors, like Avaya, note that while their software-only products aren't directly affected, the underlying Linux platform may be vulnerable if the affected package is installed.
*   The vulnerability is described as being fixed in various kernel updates, highlighting the importance of patching.
*   Some sources like the Debian advisory note the memory leak as being the issue with this CVE.
*   Some sources rate the severity as 9/10 while others rate it as "Important" or "Medium."

This analysis is based on the combined information from various sources.  It is important to note that while the core vulnerability is consistent, some details might vary slightly from source to source.
