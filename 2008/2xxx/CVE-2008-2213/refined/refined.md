Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2213:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `footer.php` file of Maian Links v3.1. Specifically, the `msg_script3` and `msg_script2` parameters are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the HTML output, specifically in the `msg_script2` and `msg_script3` parameters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the web page.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, which can be used to steal session cookies, potentially allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application. In this instance the content states, "You Can Get Admin Session With This Vuln..."
    *   **Malicious Script Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts to redirect users to a phishing site or perform other unauthorized actions within the user's session.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with the `msg_script2` or `msg_script3` parameters containing the malicious JavaScript code.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be located remotely and does not require any specific access to the server to exploit the vulnerability.
    *  **No Authentication Needed:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability without authentication.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable parameters are `msg_script3` and `msg_script2` in the `footer.php` file located in the `admin/inc` directory.
*   The exploit URL examples are:
    *   `http://Example/admin/inc/footer.php?msg_script3="<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
    *   `http://Example/admin/inc/footer.php?msg_script2=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`

**Mitigation**

*   The provided solution is to edit the source code and filter the variables using the `htmlspecialchar()` function. This will prevent the browser from interpreting the injected code.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.3, indicating a medium severity.
*   The confidentiality impact is rated as "None," while integrity impact is "Partial".
* The exploit is rated as having an 8.6/10 exploitability subscore.
