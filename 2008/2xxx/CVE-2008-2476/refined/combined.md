* **001: SECURITY FIX: October 8, 2007**
    *All architectures*

  Malicious DHCP clients could cause dhcpd(8) to corrupt its stack

  A DHCP client that claimed to require a maximum message size less than
  the minimum IP MTU could cause dhcpd(8) to overwrite stack memory.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/001_dhcpd.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: October 10, 2007**
      *All architectures*

    The SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function in OpenSSL contains an off-by-one overflow.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/002_openssl.patch)

    * **003: CD BOOT FAILURE ON OLDER COMPUTERS : October 30, 2007**
        *i386 only*

      Some older BIOSes are unable to boot CD1 (ie. the commercial release sold
      by the project, not the CD images available on the net).
      A workaround using CD2 (amd64 architecture) is as follows.
      (An amd64 machine is *NOT* required for this to work.)

      1. Insert CD2 and tell your computer to boot it;
         * When the `boot>` prompt appears, stop the automatic boot
           by pressing the space bar;
           * Remove CD2 and insert CD1;
             * Erase the character you typed to stop the boot, type

               `boot /4.2/i386/bsd.rd`

               then press *Enter*.

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: November 27, 2007**
          *All architectures*

        A memory leak in pf can lead to machine lockups.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/004_pf.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: January 11, 2008**
            *All architectures*

          A missing NULL pointer check can lead to a kernel panic.

## IPv6 implementations insecurely update Forwarding Information Base

#### Vulnerability Note VU#472363

Original Release Date: 2008-10-02 | Last Revised: 2009-04-27

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in some implementations of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol may allow a nearby attacker to intercept traffic or cause congested links to become overloaded.

### Description

| IPv6 networks use the Neighbor Discovery Protocol ([NDP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861)) to detect and locate routers and other [on-link](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861#section-2.1) IPv6 nodes. NDP uses ICMPv6 types 133, 134, 135, and 136. Neighbor solicitation (type 135) messages are used by NDP to discover and determine the reachability of nearby IPv6 nodes. Nodes that can send each other NDP messages are considered to be on-link (as per RFC [4861](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861)).  After receiving a neighbor solicitation request from a system that is on-link and is using a spoofed IPv6 address as the source address, a router will create a neighbor cache entry. When this entry is made, some IPv6 implementations will create a Forwarding Information Base ([FIB](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Forwarding_Information_Base&oldid=234297411)) entry. This FIB entry may cause the router to incorrectly forward traffic to the device that sent original spoofed neighbor solicitation request. Note that an attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for this vulnerability to be exploited. Although this vulnerability has only a local attack vector (NDP messages are not forwarded by routers), flat IPv6 networks can include many hosts and may cover large geographical distances as compared to IPv4 networks.Similar problems to this issue have been discussed in RFC [3756](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3756.txt) "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Trust Models and Threats." |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to intercept private network traffic. Receiving the traffic may cause links to become congested or saturated due to the additional bandwidth. Administrators are encouraged to read RFC [3756](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3756.txt) for more information about other possible vulnerabilities and impacts. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Consider the workarounds below and consult your vendor. |
| --- |

| **Block packets with illogical source addresses**Blocking traffic that originates from unlikely or illogical source addresses (such as addresses which are not on-link or logically part of a network assigned to an interface, such as the [antispoof](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/filter.html#antispoof) keyword in pf) will protect against this vulnerability. This workaround may cause unintended side-effects such as breaking some non-typical configurations. Vendors may also implement this workaround as a fix.**Use application layer encryption**Applications that use secure authentication and encryption such as https, ssh, and ipsec can mitigate this vulnerability by preventing an attacker from intercepting or parsing any data that received. Note that an attacker will probably still be able to blackhole IP addresses resulting in a local denial of service regardless of the authentication or encryption methods used. As noted in RFC 3971, it is non-trivial to use ipsec to protect the integrity of NDP messages.**Design and deploy segmented networks**In a single IPv6 prefix there are certain trust asumptions and if the same IP range is shared *all clients will be considered on-link.* Segmenting networks will reduce the likelihood of this and similar vulnerabilities from being exploited. Networks can be segmented by assigning unique prefixes to individual router interfaces or by using VLANs. |

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

Openwall GNU/\*/Linux does not officially support IPv6. We do not have IPv6 support enabled in our kernels by default (nor can the corresponding kernel module possibly get auto-loaded, which would be a concern on some other Linux systems - we also do not support module auto-loading). While it is probably possible to configure an Openwall GNU/\*/Linux system with a custom kernel build such that it would be vulnerable, anyone doing so is acting on his/her own.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-08:10.nd6 Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol routing vulnerability
Category: core
Module: sys\_netinet6
Announced: 2008-10-01
Credits: David Miles
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2008-10-01 00:32:59 UTC (RELENG\_7, 7.1-PRERELEASE)
2008-10-01 00:32:59 UTC (RELENG\_7\_0, 7.0-RELEASE-p5)
2008-10-01 00:32:59 UTC (RELENG\_6, 6.4-PRERELEASE)
2008-10-01 00:32:59 UTC (RELENG\_6\_3, 6.3-RELEASE-p5)
CVE Name: CVE-2008-2476
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery protocol to determine the link-layer
address of other nodes, find routers, and maintain reachability information.
The Neighbor Discovery protocol uses Neighbor Solicitation (ICMPv6 type 135)
to query target nodes for their link-layer addresses.
II. Problem Description
IPv6 routers may allow "on-link" IPv6 nodes to create and update the
router's neighbor cache and forwarding information. A malicious IPv6 node
sharing a common router but on a different physical segment from another
node may be able to spoof Neighbor Discovery messages, allowing it to update
router information for the victim node.
III. Impact
An attacker on a different physical network connected to the same IPv6
router as another node could redirect IPv6 traffic intended for that node.
This could lead to denial of service or improper access to private network
traffic.
IV. Workaround
Firewall packet filters can be used to filter incoming Neighbor
Solicitation messages but may interfere with normal IPv6 operation if not
configured carefully.
Reverse path forwarding checks could be used to make gateways, such as
routers or firewalls, drop Neighbor Solicitation messages from
nodes with unexpected source addresses on a particular interface.
IPv6 router administrators are encouraged to read RFC 3756 for further
discussion of Neighbor Discovery security implications.
V. Solution
NOTE WELL: The solution described below causes IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
Neighbor Solicitation messages from non-neighbors to be ignored.
This can be re-enabled if required by setting the newly added
net.inet6.icmp6.nd6\_onlink\_ns\_rfc4861 sysctl to a non-zero value.
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 6-STABLE, or 7-STABLE, or to the
RELENG\_7\_0, or RELENG\_6\_3 security branch dated after the correction
date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 6.3 and
7.0 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 6.3]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:10/nd6-6.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:10/nd6-6.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 7.0]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:10/nd6-7.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:10/nd6-7.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch.
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.

## IPv6 implementations insecurely update Forwarding Information Base

#### Vulnerability Note VU#472363

Original Release Date: 2008-10-02 | Last Revised: 2009-04-27

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in some implementations of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol may allow a nearby attacker to intercept traffic or cause congested links to become overloaded.

### Description

| IPv6 networks use the Neighbor Discovery Protocol ([NDP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861)) to detect and locate routers and other [on-link](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861#section-2.1) IPv6 nodes. NDP uses ICMPv6 types 133, 134, 135, and 136. Neighbor solicitation (type 135) messages are used by NDP to discover and determine the reachability of nearby IPv6 nodes. Nodes that can send each other NDP messages are considered to be on-link (as per RFC [4861](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861)).  After receiving a neighbor solicitation request from a system that is on-link and is using a spoofed IPv6 address as the source address, a router will create a neighbor cache entry. When this entry is made, some IPv6 implementations will create a Forwarding Information Base ([FIB](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Forwarding_Information_Base&oldid=234297411)) entry. This FIB entry may cause the router to incorrectly forward traffic to the device that sent original spoofed neighbor solicitation request. Note that an attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for this vulnerability to be exploited. Although this vulnerability has only a local attack vector (NDP messages are not forwarded by routers), flat IPv6 networks can include many hosts and may cover large geographical distances as compared to IPv4 networks.Similar problems to this issue have been discussed in RFC [3756](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3756.txt) "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Trust Models and Threats." |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to intercept private network traffic. Receiving the traffic may cause links to become congested or saturated due to the additional bandwidth. Administrators are encouraged to read RFC [3756](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3756.txt) for more information about other possible vulnerabilities and impacts. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Consider the workarounds below and consult your vendor. |
| --- |

| **Block packets with illogical source addresses**Blocking traffic that originates from unlikely or illogical source addresses (such as addresses which are not on-link or logically part of a network assigned to an interface, such as the [antispoof](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/filter.html#antispoof) keyword in pf) will protect against this vulnerability. This workaround may cause unintended side-effects such as breaking some non-typical configurations. Vendors may also implement this workaround as a fix.**Use application layer encryption**Applications that use secure authentication and encryption such as https, ssh, and ipsec can mitigate this vulnerability by preventing an attacker from intercepting or parsing any data that received. Note that an attacker will probably still be able to blackhole IP addresses resulting in a local denial of service regardless of the authentication or encryption methods used. As noted in RFC 3971, it is non-trivial to use ipsec to protect the integrity of NDP messages.**Design and deploy segmented networks**In a single IPv6 prefix there are certain trust asumptions and if the same IP range is shared *all clients will be considered on-link.* Segmenting networks will reduce the likelihood of this and similar vulnerabilities from being exploited. Networks can be segmented by assigning unique prefixes to individual router interfaces or by using VLANs. |

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

Openwall GNU/\*/Linux does not officially support IPv6. We do not have IPv6 support enabled in our kernels by default (nor can the corresponding kernel module possibly get auto-loaded, which would be a concern on some other Linux systems - we also do not support module auto-loading). While it is probably possible to configure an Openwall GNU/\*/Linux system with a custom kernel build such that it would be vulnerable, anyone doing so is acting on his/her own.

## IPv6 implementations insecurely update Forwarding Information Base

#### Vulnerability Note VU#472363

Original Release Date: 2008-10-02 | Last Revised: 2009-04-27

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in some implementations of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol may allow a nearby attacker to intercept traffic or cause congested links to become overloaded.

### Description

| IPv6 networks use the Neighbor Discovery Protocol ([NDP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861)) to detect and locate routers and other [on-link](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861#section-2.1) IPv6 nodes. NDP uses ICMPv6 types 133, 134, 135, and 136. Neighbor solicitation (type 135) messages are used by NDP to discover and determine the reachability of nearby IPv6 nodes. Nodes that can send each other NDP messages are considered to be on-link (as per RFC [4861](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861)).  After receiving a neighbor solicitation request from a system that is on-link and is using a spoofed IPv6 address as the source address, a router will create a neighbor cache entry. When this entry is made, some IPv6 implementations will create a Forwarding Information Base ([FIB](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Forwarding_Information_Base&oldid=234297411)) entry. This FIB entry may cause the router to incorrectly forward traffic to the device that sent original spoofed neighbor solicitation request. Note that an attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for this vulnerability to be exploited. Although this vulnerability has only a local attack vector (NDP messages are not forwarded by routers), flat IPv6 networks can include many hosts and may cover large geographical distances as compared to IPv4 networks.Similar problems to this issue have been discussed in RFC [3756](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3756.txt) "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Trust Models and Threats." |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to intercept private network traffic. Receiving the traffic may cause links to become congested or saturated due to the additional bandwidth. Administrators are encouraged to read RFC [3756](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3756.txt) for more information about other possible vulnerabilities and impacts. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Consider the workarounds below and consult your vendor. |
| --- |

| **Block packets with illogical source addresses**Blocking traffic that originates from unlikely or illogical source addresses (such as addresses which are not on-link or logically part of a network assigned to an interface, such as the [antispoof](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/filter.html#antispoof) keyword in pf) will protect against this vulnerability. This workaround may cause unintended side-effects such as breaking some non-typical configurations. Vendors may also implement this workaround as a fix.**Use application layer encryption**Applications that use secure authentication and encryption such as https, ssh, and ipsec can mitigate this vulnerability by preventing an attacker from intercepting or parsing any data that received. Note that an attacker will probably still be able to blackhole IP addresses resulting in a local denial of service regardless of the authentication or encryption methods used. As noted in RFC 3971, it is non-trivial to use ipsec to protect the integrity of NDP messages.**Design and deploy segmented networks**In a single IPv6 prefix there are certain trust asumptions and if the same IP range is shared *all clients will be considered on-link.* Segmenting networks will reduce the likelihood of this and similar vulnerabilities from being exploited. Networks can be segmented by assigning unique prefixes to individual router interfaces or by using VLANs. |

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#MAPG-7H2S3F) Not Affected

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

Openwall GNU/\*/Linux does not officially support IPv6. We do not have IPv6 support enabled in our kernels by default (nor can the corresponding kernel module possibly get auto-loaded, which would be a concern on some other Linux systems - we also do not support module auto-loading). While it is probably possible to configure an Openwall GNU/\*/Linux system with a custom kernel build such that it would be vulnerable, anyone doing so is acting on his/her own.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: SECURITY FIX: March 30, 2008**
    *All architectures*

  sshd(8) would execute ~/.ssh/rc even when a sshd\_config(5) *ForceCommand*
  directive was in effect, allowing users with write access to this file to
  execute arbitrary commands. This behaviour was documented, but was an unsafe
  default and an extra hassle for administrators.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/001_openssh.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: April 3, 2008**
      *All architectures*

    Avoid possible hijacking of X11-forwarded connections with sshd(8)
    by refusing to listen on a port unless all address families bind
    successfully.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/002_openssh2.patch)

    * **003: SECURITY FIX: July 15, 2008**
        *All architectures*

      Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in X.Org.

      RENDER Extension heap buffer overflow,
      RENDER Extension crash,
      RENDER Extension memory corruption,
      MIT-SHM arbitrary memory read,
      RECORD and Security extensions memory corruption.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/003_xorg.patch)

      * **004: SECURITY FIX: July 23, 2008**
          *All architectures*

        **2nd revision, July 23, 2008**

        A vulnerability has been found with BIND. An attacker could use this vulnerability
        to poison the cache of a recursive resolving name server.
        [CVE-2008-1447](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1447).

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/004_bind.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: July 29, 2008**
            *All architectures*

          Some kinds of IPv6 usage would leak kernel memory (in particular, this path
          was exercised by the named(8) patch for port randomization). Since INET6 is
          enabled by default, this condition affects all systems.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/005_pcb.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: October 2, 2008**
              *All architectures*

            The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ndp) did not correctly verify neighbor
            solicitation requests maybe allowing a nearby attacker to intercept traffic.
            The attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for
            this vulnerability to be exploited.
            [CVE-2008-2476](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2476).

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/006_ndp.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: January 9, 2009**
                *All architectures*

              The OpenSSL libraries did not correctly check the return value from
              certain verification functions, allowing validation to be bypassed and
              permitting a remote attacker to conduct a "man in the middle attack"
              against SSL/TLS connections if the server is configured with a DSA or ECDSA
              certificate.
              [CVE-2008-5077](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5077).

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/007_openssl.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: January 14, 2009**
                  *All architectures*

                named(8) did not correctly check the return value of a DSA verification
                function, potentially allowing bypass of verification of DNSSEC DSA
                signatures.
                [CVE-2009-0025](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0025).

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/008_bind.patch)

                * **009: RELIABILITY FIX: January 30, 2009**
                    *All architectures*

                  Upon reception of an invalid update with 4-byte AS attributes, bgpd -
                  adhering to the RFCs - closed the session to the neighbor.
                  This error in the specification allowed 3rd parties to close remote BGP
                  sessions.
                  In the worst case Internet connectivity could be lost.

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/009_bgpd.patch)

                  * **010: RELIABILITY FIX: February 18, 2009**
                      *All architectures*

                    bgpd(8) did not correctly prepend its own AS to very long AS paths, causing
                    the process to terminate because of the resulting corrupt path.

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/010_bgpd.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: February 22, 2009**
                        *All architectures*

                      sudo(8) may allow a user listed in the sudoers file to run a command
                      as a different user than their access rule specifies when a Unix
                      group is used in the RunAs portion of the rule. The bug only manifests
                      when the user being granted privileges is also a member of the group
                      in the RunAs portion of the rule.

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/011_sudo.patch)

                      * **012: RELIABILITY FIX: April 8, 2009**
                          *All architectures*

                        The OpenSSL ASN.1 handling code could be forced to perform invalid memory
                        accesses through the use of certain invalid strings
                        ([CVE-2009-0590](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0590))
                        or under certain error conditions triggerable by invalid ASN.1 structures
                        ([CVE-2009-0789](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0789)).
                        These vulnerabilities could be exploited to achieve a
                        denial-of-service. A more detailed description of these problems is available
                        in the
                        [OpenSSL security advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20090325.txt), but note that the other issue described there "Incorrect Error
                        Checking During CMS verification" relates to code not enabled in OpenBSD.

                        * **013: RELIABILITY FIX: April 11, 2009**
                            *All architectures*

                          When pf attempts to perform translation on a specially crafted IP datagram,
                          a null pointer dereference will occur, resulting in a kernel panic.
                          In certain configurations this may be triggered by a remote attacker.

                          Restricting translation rules to protocols that are specific to the IP version
                          in use, is an effective workaround until the patch can be installed. As an
                          example, for IPv4 nat/binat/rdr rules you can use:
                          ```

                              nat/rdr ... inet proto { tcp udp icmp } ...

                          ```
                          Or for IPv6 nat/binat/rdr rules you can use:
                          ```

                              nat/rdr ... inet6 proto { tcp udp icmp6 } ...

                          ```
