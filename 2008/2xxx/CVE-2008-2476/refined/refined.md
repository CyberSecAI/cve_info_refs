{
  "CVE-2008-2476": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) implementations did not correctly verify neighbor solicitation requests.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of proper validation of the origin of Neighbor Discovery messages."
      ],
      "Impact": "A nearby attacker could intercept traffic or cause congested links to become overloaded. An attacker may be able to intercept private network traffic. Receiving the traffic may cause links to become congested or saturated due to the additional bandwidth.",
      "Attack vectors": "A malicious IPv6 node sharing a common router but on a different physical segment from another node may be able to spoof Neighbor Discovery messages, allowing it to update router information for the victim node. The attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target and be on a different physical segment from the victim."
    },
    {
        "Root cause": "IPv6 routers may allow \"on-link\" IPv6 nodes to create and update the router's neighbor cache and forwarding information.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "A malicious IPv6 node can spoof Neighbor Discovery messages."
        ],
        "Impact": "An attacker on a different physical network connected to the same IPv6 router as another node could redirect IPv6 traffic intended for that node. This could lead to denial of service or improper access to private network traffic.",
         "Attack vectors": "A malicious IPv6 node sharing a common router can spoof Neighbor Discovery messages.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position":"Attacker must be on a different physical network, connected to the same IPv6 router."
      },
    {
      "Root cause": "The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol implementation does not validate the origin of Neighbor Discovery messages.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of validation of Neighbor Discovery message origin"
      ],
       "Impact": "A remote user may be able to cause a denial of service attack, observe private network traffic, or inject forged packets.",
      "Attack vectors": "By sending a maliciously crafted message, a remote user may cause a denial of service, observe private network traffic, or inject forged packets.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position":"Remote user capable of sending maliciously crafted IPv6 messages."
