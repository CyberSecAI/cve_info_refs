```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application allows adding an admin user through the `addUser.php` script without proper authentication or authorization checks. The userID parameter is set to 'admin', but it does not appear to be validated.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Missing authentication/authorization: The script allows anyone to add a new admin user.
    - Hardcoded admin userID: The script uses a hardcoded value "admin" for userID, which is not validated in any way.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can create a new administrator account, gaining full control over the application.
- Attack vectors:
    - The vulnerability is exploited by sending an HTTP POST request to the `addUser.php` endpoint with the necessary parameters to create a new admin user.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to know the base URL of the MyPicGallery application and must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server.
