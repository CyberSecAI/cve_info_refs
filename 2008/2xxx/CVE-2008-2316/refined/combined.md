# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

 [Gentoo Handbook (Official installation documentation)](/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page "Handbook:Main Page")

 **Important**
Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

David Remahl of Apple Product Security reports the following:  [...]  We have identified a number of integer overflow security issues in the core python library (dealing with some of the basic types). I also found an integer overflow issue in the strop module and one in hashlib (leading to unreliable cryptographic digest results). Additionally, a number of issues that are expected to be resolved by <<http://bugs.python.org/issue2620>> were identified in this audit.  These issues are detailed in the files attached below. Patches and test cases are included. Note that some issues only affect certain architectures, e.g. 32/64 bit or 2/4 byte unicode. 2.5.2 and 2.6b1 are vulnerable to varying extents (see patches for details). 3.0a has not been investigated, nor have 2.4 and earlier releases. Some of the test cases need to be run with regrtest.py -M <large value>. A new test decorator (precisionbigmemtest) was created because of the need to have bigmem tests that take a specific size value, not just the largest size that can be accommodated.  The following CVE names have been assigned by Apple:  CVE-2008-2315: Multiple integer overflows in python core (stringobject, unicodeobject, bufferobject, longobject, tupleobject, stropmodule, gcmodule, mmapmodule) CVE-2008-2316: Partial hashlib hashing of data exceeding 4GB (_hashopenssl)  Also included in this message are patches for some non-security bugs that were encountered during the audit. They have no test cases and have received little testing. Caveat emptor.  [...] Note that one of the issues is in the same code snippet that was touched in PSF-2006-001 (CVE-2006-4980).  The Python Security Response Team was notified of these issues recently and they have acknowledged that they received the message. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-03 14:45:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 159416](attachment.cgi?id=159416 "CVE-2008-2315 patch 2.5") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=159416&action=edit "CVE-2008-2315 patch 2.5"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=159416&action=diff "CVE-2008-2315 patch 2.5")] CVE-2008-2315 patch 2.5 ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-03 14:45:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 159418](attachment.cgi?id=159418 "CVE-2008-2315 patch trunk") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=159418&action=edit "CVE-2008-2315 patch trunk"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=159418&action=diff "CVE-2008-2315 patch trunk")] CVE-2008-2315 patch trunk ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-03 14:45:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 159420](attachment.cgi?id=159420 "CVE-2008-2316 patch 2.5") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=159420&action=edit "CVE-2008-2316 patch 2.5"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=159420&action=diff "CVE-2008-2316 patch 2.5")] CVE-2008-2316 patch 2.5 ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-03 14:46:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 159422](attachment.cgi?id=159422 "CVE-2008-2316 patch trunk") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=159422&action=edit "CVE-2008-2316 patch trunk"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=159422&action=diff "CVE-2008-2316 patch trunk")] CVE-2008-2316 patch trunk ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-03 14:46:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 159424](attachment.cgi?id=159424 "misc fixes 2.5") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=159424&action=edit "misc fixes 2.5"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=159424&action=diff "misc fixes 2.5")] misc fixes 2.5 ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-03 14:46:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 159426](attachment.cgi?id=159426 "misc fixes trunk") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=159426&action=edit "misc fixes trunk"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=159426&action=diff "misc fixes trunk")] misc fixes trunk ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-03 16:12:57 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 230589](show_bug.cgi?id=230589 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - dev-lang/python Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2008-2315, CVE-2008-2316)") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Ali Polatel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-07-13 14:35:48 UTC  ``` An ebuild will be attached as soon as I get back home.

used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- powerdns spoofing problems
The PowerDNS packages were updated to offer better spoofing
resistance by not ignoring invalid queries. (CVE-2008-3337)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- dnsmasq spoofing problems
The DNS server dnsmasq was changed to use random UDP source ports
and a random TRXID now. (CVE-2008-1447)
This problem only affected openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- python multiple problems
The scripting language python was updated to fix several security
vulnerabilities. (CVE-2008-1679,CVE-2008-1887, CVE-2008-3143,
CVE-2008-3142, CVE-2008-3144, CVE-2008-2315, CVE-2008-2316)
All SUSE Linux products received updated python packages.
- mailman cross site scripting
The mailing list manager mailman was updated to fix a
cross-site-scripting bug (CVE-2008-0564) and a mistake in
translation.
All distributions containing mailman received updated packages.
- ruby multiple problems
The scripting language ruby was updated to fix:
- a possible information leakage (CVE-2008-1145)
- a directory traversal bug (CVE-2008-1891) in WEBrick
- various memory corruptions and integer overflows in array and
string handling (CVE-2008-2662, CVE-2008-2663, CVE-2008-2664,
CVE-2008-2725, CVE-2008-2726, CVE-2008-2727, CVE-2008-2728)
ruby was updated on all SUSE Linux products.
- Opera 9.52
Opera was upgraded to version 9.52 to fix possible security
vulnerabilities.
Please see <http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/952/> for
more details.
- neon NULL pointer problem
The helper library neon was updated to fix a NULL pointer dereference
in the digest authentication code. (CVE-2008-3746)
neon was updated on all affected distributions.
- rxvt-unicode session hijacking
Using rxvt-unicode it was possible to open a terminal on :0 when
the environment variable was not set.
This could be exploited by local users to hijack X11 connections (CVE-2008-1142).
rxvt-unicode was updated on openSUSE 10.2-11.0.
- perl multiple problems
Several problems were fixed in the scripting language perl.
Specially crafted regular expressions could crash perl
(CVE-2008-1927).
Insufficient symlink checks in the File::Path could result in wrong
file permissions (CVE-2008-2827).
Additionally problem in the CGI module was fixed that could result
in an endless loop if uploads were canceled.
- Wireshark / ethereal multiple security problems
Various vulnerabilities have been fixed in ethereal and wireshark:
CVE-2008-3137, CVE-2008-3138, CVE-2008-3139,
CVE-2008-3140, CVE-2008-3141, CVE-2008-3145
and CVE-2008-3146. Those could be potentially used to crash
wireshark or potentially execute code.
Updates have been released for all SUSE Linux distributions.
- namazu cross site scripting
The indexing engine namazu was upgraded to fix a UTF-7
cross-site-scripting vulnerability. (CVE-2008-1468)
namazu was updated on all products containing it.
- gnome-screensaver clipboard disclosure
gnome-screensaver was updated to disallows local users to
read the contents of the clipboard for a locked screen using
ctrl-v. (CVE-2007-6389)
Updates have been released for openSUSE 10.3, other distributions
were not affected.
- MySQL security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix a security problem:
CVE-2008-2079: MySQL allowed local users to bypass certain privilege
checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1)
DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within
the MySQL home data directory, which can point to tables that are
created in the future.
CVE-2006-7232: sql\_select.cc in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.32 and 5.1.x
before 5.1.14 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA
table, as originally demonstrated using ORDER BY.
MySQL was updated on all SUSE Linux distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [python2.4](/security/cves?package=python2.4) -
* [python2.5](/security/cves?package=python2.5) -

## Details

It was discovered that there were new integer overflows in the imageop

module. If an attacker were able to trick a Python application into

processing a specially crafted image, they could execute arbitrary code

with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1679](/security/CVE-2008-1679))

Justin Ferguson discovered that the zlib module did not correctly

handle certain archives. If an attacker were able to trick a Python

application into processing a specially crafted archive file, they could

execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1721](/security/CVE-2008-1721))

Justin Ferguson discovered that certain string manipulations in Python

could be made to overflow. If an attacker were able to pass a specially

crafted string through the PyString\_FromStringAndSize function, they

could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-1887](/security/CVE-2008-1887))

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Python's core and modules

including hashlib, binascii, pickle, md5, stringobject, unicodeobject,

bufferobject, longobject, tupleobject, stropmodule, gcmodule, and

mmapmodule. If an attacker were able to exploit these flaws they could

execute arbitrary code with user privileges or cause Python applications

to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-2315](/security/CVE-2008-2315), [CVE-2008-2316](/security/CVE-2008-2316),

[CVE-2008-3142](/security/CVE-2008-3142), [CVE-2008-3143](/security/CVE-2008-3143), [CVE-2008-3144](/security/CVE-2008-3144)).

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Python: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200807-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Python may allow for the execution of arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/python** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.2-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.4.4-r14**>= **2.5.2-r6**revision >= **2.4.6** |

### Background

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Python:

* David Remahl of Apple Product Security reported several integer
  overflows in core modules such as stringobject, unicodeobject,
  bufferobject, longobject, tupleobject, stropmodule, gcmodule,
  mmapmodule (CVE-2008-2315).
* David Remahl of Apple Product Security also reported an integer
  overflow in the hashlib module, leading to unreliable cryptographic
  digest results (CVE-2008-2316).
* Justin Ferguson reported multiple buffer overflows in unicode string
  processing that only affect 32bit systems (CVE-2008-3142).
* The Google Security Team reported multiple integer overflows
  (CVE-2008-3143).
* Justin Ferguson reported multiple integer underflows and overflows in
  the PyOS\_vsnprintf() function, and an off-by-one error when passing
  zero-length strings, leading to memory corruption (CVE-2008-3144).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities in Python
applications or daemons that pass user-controlled input to vulnerable
functions. Exploitation might lead to the execution of arbitrary code
or a Denial of Service. Vulnerabilities within the hashlib might lead
to weakened cryptographic protection of data integrity or authenticity.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Python 2.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.4.4-r14"
```

All Python 2.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.5.2-r6"
```

Please note that Python 2.3 is masked since June 24, and we will not be
releasing updates to it. It will be removed from the tree in the near
future.

This update addresses the issue through improved validation of resource forks. Credit: Apple.

* **CFNetwork**

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5.6

  Impact: Restores proper operation of cookies with null expiration times

  Description: This update addresses a non-security regression introduced in Mac OS X 10.5.6. Cookies may not be properly set if a web site attempts to set a session cookie by supplying a null value in the "expires" field, rather than omitting the field. This update addresses the issue by ignoring the "expires" field if it has a null value.

* **CFNetwork**

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5.6

  Impact: Restores proper operation of session cookies across applications

  Description: This update addresses a non-security regression introduced in Mac OS X 10.5.6. CFNetwork may not save cookies to disk if multiple open applications attempt to set session cookies. This update addresses the issue by ensuring that each application stores its session cookies separately.

* **Certificate Assistant**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0011

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5.6

  Impact: A local user may manipulate files with the privileges of another user running Certificate Assistant

  Description: An insecure file operation exists in Certificate Assistant's handling of temporary files. This could allow a local user to overwrite files with the privileges of another user who is running Certificate Assistant. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of temporary files. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5. Credit: Apple.

* **ClamAV**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-5050, CVE-2008-5314

  Available for: Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.5.6

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in ClamAV 0.94

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in ClamAV 0.94, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issues by updating ClamAV to version 0.94.2. ClamAV is distributed only with Mac OS X Server systems. Further information is available via the ClamAV website at <http://www.clamav.net/>

* **CoreText**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0012

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5.6

  Impact: Viewing maliciously crafted Unicode content may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow may occur when processing Unicode strings in CoreText. Using CoreText to handle maliciously crafted Unicode strings, such as when viewing a maliciously crafted web page, may result in an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5. Credit to Rosyna of Unsanity for reporting this issue.

* **CUPS**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-5183

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5.6

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination

  Description: Exceeding the maximum number of RSS subscriptions results in a null pointer dereference in the CUPS web interface. This may lead to an unexpected application termination when visiting a maliciously crafted website. In order to trigger this issue, valid user credentials must either be known by the attacker or cached in the user's web browser. CUPS will be automatically restarted after this issue is triggered. This update addresses the issue by properly handling the number of RSS subscriptions. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5.

* **DS Tools**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0013

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5.6

  Impact: Passwords supplied to dscl are exposed to other local users

  Description: The dscl command-line tool required that passwords be passed to it in its arguments, potentially exposing the passwords to other local users. Passwords exposed include those for users and administrators. This update makes the password parameter optional, and dscl will prompt for the password if needed. Credit: Apple.

* **fetchmail**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2007-4565, CVE-2008-2711

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5.6

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in fetchmail 6.3.8, the most serious of which may lead to a denial of service. This update addresses the issues by updating to version 6.3.9. Further information is available via the fetchmail web site at <http://fetchmail.berlios.de/>

* **Folder Manager**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0014

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5.6

  Impact: Other local users may access the Downloads folder

  Description: A default permissions issue exists in Folder Manager. When a user deletes their Downloads folder and Folder Manager recreates it, the folder is created with read permissions for everyone. This update addresses the issue by having Folder Manager limit permissions so that the folder is accessible only to the user. This issue only affects applications using Folder Manager. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5. Credit to Graham Perrin of CENTRIM, University of Brighton for reporting this issue.

* **FSEvents**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0015

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5.6

  Impact: Using the FSEvents framework, a local user may be able to see filesystem activity that would otherwise not be available

  Description: A credential management issue exists in fseventsd. By using the FSEvents framework, a local user may be able to see filesystem activity that would otherwise not be available. This includes the name of a directory which the user would not otherwise be able to see, and the detection of activity in the directory at a given time.
