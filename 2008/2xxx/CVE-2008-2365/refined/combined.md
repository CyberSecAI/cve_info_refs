How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE-2008-2365 kernel: ptrace: Crash on PTRACE_{ATTACH,DETACH} race
	-- affecting kernel versions <= 2.6.25

Hello guys,

  wanted to inform you about recently discovered utrace/ptrace
attach and detach race condition affecting Linux kernel from versions
2.6.9 up to the upstream one (< 2.6.25).
The upstream Linux kernel version got already patched with the following
three patches, which resolve this issue:

<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.25.y.git;a=commit;h=5ecfbae093f0c37311e89b29bfc0c9d586eace87>
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.25.y.git;a=commit;h=f5b40e363ad6041a96e3da32281d8faa191597b9>
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.25.y.git;a=commit;h=f358166a9405e4f1d8e50d8f415c26d95505b6de>

More 2.6.9 kernel version specific details about this issue
can be found at:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2008-2365>

To resolve this issue on the 2.6.9 version of the Linux kernel,
you will need to backport the above upstream patches.

There is also testcase available to reproduce this issue at:

<http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/tests/ptrace-tests/tests/late-ptrace-may-attach-check.c?cvsroot=systemtap>

This works for both utrace (2.6.9) and ptrace (not patched upstream)
*trace call versions.

Please use CVE-2008-2365 identifier, for future references to this
issue.

If you are shipping kernel versions < 2.6.25, you are encouraged
to fix this issue.

Let me know, if you would need any further details about this issue
and ways, how to reproduce it.

Kind regards
Jan iankko Lieskovsky

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=449359#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-06-02 12:13:55 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Alexei Dobryanov has reported the following kernel utrace related issue ([BZ#245735](show_bug.cgi?id=245735)):  1. late ptrace_may_attach() check     static int ptrace_attach(struct task_struct *task)    {         ...         engine = utrace_attach(task, (UTRACE_ATTACH_CREATE                                       | UTRACE_ATTACH_EXCLUSIVE                                       | UTRACE_ATTACH_MATCH_OPS),                                &ptrace_utrace_ops, 0);         [error checking]         if (ptrace_may_attach(task)) {                 [more attaching process]     Doing may attach check there is asking for trouble, because utrace_attach()    will happily create and modify "struct utrace *" and create and attach    engines to it on task you don't have permissions.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0508)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and a bug are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

These updated packages fix the following security issues:

* A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel memory copy routines, when

running on certain AMD64 systems. If an unsuccessful attempt to copy kernel
memory from source to destination memory locations occurred, the copy
routines did not zero the content at the destination memory location. This
could allow a local unprivileged user to view potentially sensitive data.
(CVE-2008-2729, Important)

* Alexey Dobriyan discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel

process-tracing system call, ptrace. A local unprivileged user could
use this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel hang).
(CVE-2008-2365, Important)

* Tavis Ormandy discovered a deficiency in the Linux kernel 32-bit and

64-bit emulation. This could allow a local unprivileged user to prepare and
run a specially crafted binary, which would use this deficiency to leak
uninitialized and potentially sensitive data. (CVE-2008-0598, Important)

* It was discovered that the Linux kernel handled string operations in the

opposite way to the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). This could allow a local
unprivileged user to cause memory corruption. (CVE-2008-1367, Low)

As well, these updated packages fix the following bug:

* On systems with a large number of CPUs (more than 16), multiple

applications calling the "times()" system call may have caused a system
hang.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=451271#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2008-06-13 17:25:10 UTC  ``` Description of problem: =======================  Andi Kleen has provided upstream fix for the following x86_64 arch related issue:  - Don't zero for __copy_from_user_inatomic following i386. This will prevent spurious zeros for parallel file system writers when one does a exception - The string instruction version didn't zero the output on exception. Oops.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): All Linux kernel version prior 2.6.19  How reproducible: Always    Actual results: The possibility of potentially sensitive data leak.  Expected results: No sensitive data leak.  Additional info:  Link to upstream commit:  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=3022d734a54cbd2b65eea9a024564821101b4a9a;hp=f0f4c3432e5e1087b3a8c0e6bd4113d3c37497ff>  This issue discovered by Cai Qian in RH in process of RHSA-2008:0508 kernel QA testing.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=451271#c13)  Vincent Danen    2010-12-23 19:06:40 UTC  ``` This was addressed via:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 4 (RHSA-2008:0508) Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 5 (RHSA-2008:0519) MRG Realtime for RHEL 5 Server (RHSA-2008:0585)   ``` |  |

Jan, these patches are from 2006 and were even fixed in a 2.6.16.x stable release...
and the code was rewritten in 2.6.17 as far as I can see.

So is 2.6.25 really the upper bound?

Ciao, Marcus
