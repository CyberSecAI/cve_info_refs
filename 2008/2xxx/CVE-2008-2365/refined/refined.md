{
  "CVE-2008-2365": {
    "Description": "A race condition was discovered between ptrace and utrace in the kernel. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "A race condition exists in the Linux kernel's process tracing system call, specifically between ptrace and utrace during attach and detach operations.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Race condition in ptrace/utrace attach/detach operations"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can exploit this race condition to crash the system, leading to a denial of service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system and have the ability to call ptrace/utrace system calls."
