Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2778

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `search` parameter of the RevokeBB application. The `var_filtrer()` function, intended to sanitize input, is actually empty and does nothing. While the `String()` function performs some basic filtering such as `stripslashes`, `trim`, `strip_tags`, `htmlentities`, it does not prevent SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The unsanitized `search` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database compromise:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can lead to:
    *   Data theft: Extracting sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
    *   Data modification: Altering or deleting database records.
    *   Privilege escalation: Possibly gaining administrative access to the application by manipulating user accounts.
    *  Complete database compromise: Depending on the privileges of the database user, the attacker could potentially take complete control over the entire database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is exploitable via an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `search` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable RevokeBB application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** A basic understanding of SQL is required to craft malicious payloads to inject into the `search` parameter.

**Technical Details (from exploit-db):**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a detailed walkthrough of the vulnerable code segments in `inc/acts/search.module.php`, `inc/class_search.php`, and `inc/class_var_filtrer.php`.
*   It demonstrates that the `var_filtrer()` function is empty and the `String()` function does not provide sufficient input sanitization.
*   It provides example exploit payloads to demonstrate SQL injection:
    *   `http://localhost/RevokeBB/?search=%25%27pwnz00red`
    *   `http://localhost/RevokeBB/?search=|The:Paradox|%25%27/**/union/**/select/**/1,2,3,4,5,6,concat(user_nick,0x3a,user_password),8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18/**/from/**/revokebb_users/**/where/**/user_id=1/*`
*   The first payload demonstrates the error generated by injecting a single quote character. The second demonstrates a successful union-based SQL injection to retrieve a user's username and password hash.

**Additional Notes:**

* The exploit is marked as "SQL Injection Vulnerability" and is said to be "Magic Quotes Indipendent", meaning it is exploitable regardless of whether magic quotes are enabled on the server.
