### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird
an open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The
SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver production-quality
releases of code derived from the application formerly known as the
'Mozilla Application Suite'. XULRunner is a Mozilla runtime package
that can be used to bootstrap XUL+XPCOM applications like Firefox and
Thunderbird.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were reported in all mentioned Mozilla
products:

* TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative reported that an incorrect integer
  data type is used as a CSS object reference counter, leading to a
  counter overflow and a free() of in-use memory (CVE-2008-2785).
* Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman and Gary Kwong reported crashes in the
  JavaScript engine, possibly triggering memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-2799).
* Devon Hubbard, Jesse Ruderman, and Martijn Wargers reported crashes in
  the layout engine, possibly triggering memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-2798).
* moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that XUL documents that include a script from a
  chrome: URI that points to a fastload file would be executed with the
  privileges specified in the file (CVE-2008-2802).
* moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that the mozIJSSubScriptLoader.LoadScript()
  function only apply XPCNativeWrappers to scripts loaded from standard
  "chrome:" URIs, which could be the case in third-party add-ons
  (CVE-2008-2803).
* Astabis reported a crash in the block reflow implementation related to
  large images (CVE-2008-2811).
* John G. Myers, Frank Benkstein and Nils Toedtmann reported a weakness
  in the trust model used by Mozilla, that when a user accepts an SSL
  server certificate on the basis of the CN domain name in the DN field,
  the certificate is also regarded as accepted for all domain names in
  subjectAltName:dNSName fields (CVE-2008-2809).

The following vulnerabilities were reported in Firefox, SeaMonkey and
XULRunner:

* moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that the Same Origin Policy is not properly
  enforced on JavaScript (CVE-2008-2800).
* Collin Jackson and Adam Barth reported that JAR signing is not properly
  implemented, allowing injection of JavaScript into documents within a
  JAR archive (CVE-2008-2801).
* Opera Software reported an error allowing for arbitrary local file
  upload (CVE-2008-2805).
* Daniel Glazman reported that an invalid .properties file for an add-on
  might lead to the usage of uninitialized memory (CVE-2008-2807).
* Masahiro Yamada reported that HTML in "file://" URLs in directory
  listings is not properly escaped (CVE-2008-2808).
* Geoff reported that the context of Windows Internet shortcut files is
  not correctly identified (CVE-2008-2810).
* The crash vulnerability (CVE-2008-1380) that was previously announced
  in GLSA 200805-18 is now also also resolved in Seamonkey binary
  ebuilds.

The following vulnerability was reported in Firefox only:

* Billy Rios reported that the Pipe character in a command-line URI is
  identified as a request to open multiple tabs, allowing to open
  "chrome" and "file" URIs (CVE-2008-2933).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly
leading to the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service. It
is also possible for an attacker to trick a user to upload arbitrary
files or to accept an invalid certificate for a spoofed web site, to
read uninitialized memory, to violate Same Origin Policy, or to conduct
Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.16"

# New Security Issue Under Investigation

Window Snyder
June 18, 2008

[20 responses](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2008/06/18/new-security-issue-under-investigation/#comments)

TippingPoint ZDI notified Mozilla of a vulnerability in Firefox that impacts versions 2.x and 3.0.  This issue is currently under investigation.  To protect our users, the details of the issue will remain closed until a patch is made available.  There is no public exploit, the details are private, and so the current risk to users is minimal.

TippingPoint will also keep the details closed to protect Firefox users.  From [their blog post](http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/blog/2008/06/18/vulnerability-in-mozilla-firefox-30):

> While Mozilla is working on a fix, we wont be divulging anything else until a patch is available, adhering to our vulnerability disclosure policy.  Once the issue is patched, we’ll be publishing an advisory [here](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/published/). Working with Mozilla on past security issues, we’ve found them to have a good track record and expect a reasonable turnaround on this issue as well.

At Mozilla we appreciate any report of security issues because that is how we make the browser stronger and more secure.  The best way to keep Firefox users safe is to report the issues directly to Mozilla as TippingPoint has chosen to, and to wait to release details until a fix is available.

My internet server is working on it but unable to access my e-mails at this time. I hope this doe’s not ruin or cause a bug, because I am now experiencing pop-ups as well, I sure wish I never downloaded this new version. I liked the past one much better.

    > Actually this is a very nice chance to prove that security is one of the main priorities of mozilla. It just takes a quick fix to gain even more publicity. After all, there’s no chance that a piece of software can be 100% bullet-proof. A browser’s security should be decided on how fast each hole is fixed, so if it’s fixed quickly, it could be turned to a positive news headline.

    > Wondering if there is any news on when a fix will be out. My work has suspended use of Firefox and made us go back to IE7 and using the excuse of this problem to keep us from using the browser we like. Firefox works so much better for us that are sight impaired I hope all can be fixed soon.

    > I was running Firefox 2 yesterday and suddenly the screen was taken over by a screaming warning about spyware with 2 fixes that I needed to install IMMEDIATELY because my computer was compromised and at least one of the problems was CRITICAL. The caps are not mine. However, the references were to Microsoft, and I have a Mac. Also, there were words misspelled and a couple of grammatical oddities. When I declined to install – only then – a Firefox notice appeared. I finally got rid of the warning by shutting down Firefox, and today I upgraded to Firefox 3.

    > Either this was a viral problem or I do actually have trouble on my Mac. I can’t find the warning at the moment and have not been able to get through to Firefox. I would like to know what’s up. lel

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Advisory Details

July 17th, 2008
## Mozilla Firefox CSSValue Array Memory Corruption Vulnerability

### ZDI-08-044ZDI-CAN-349

| CVE ID | [CVE-2008-2785](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2785) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [2.0.x](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) [3.0.x](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['6204']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.  The specific flaw exists in the browser's handling reference counters to the nsCSSValue:Array class. Creating more then 65,535 references will overflow a 16-bit reference counter and therefore result in an erroneous free() while the object still exists. Properly manipulated this can result in arbitrary code execution under the context of the current user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Mozilla Firefox has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2008/mfsa2008-34.html> |

# USN-626-1: Firefox and xulrunner vulnerabilities

28 July 2008

Firefox and xulrunner vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [firefox-3.0](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.0) -
* [xulrunner-1.9](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9) -

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the browser engine. A variable could be made to

overflow causing the browser to crash. If a user were tricked into opening

a malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service or

possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2008-2785](/security/CVE-2008-2785))

Billy Rios discovered that Firefox and xulrunner, as used by browsers

such as Epiphany, did not properly perform URI splitting with pipe

symbols when passed a command-line URI. If Firefox or xulrunner were

passed a malicious URL, an attacker may be able to execute local

content with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-2933](/security/CVE-2008-2933))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [firefox-3.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox-3.0)
  -
  [3.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox-3.0/3.0.1%2Bbuild1%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.3)
* [xulrunner-1.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9)
  -
  [1.9.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9/1.9.0.1%2Bbuild1%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.3)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox and any

applications that use xulrunner, such as Epiphany, to effect the

necessary changes.

# Slackware

The story of Slackware is pretty darn interesting, when you start to dig a little deeper. Perhaps the most compelling element to the narrative is its longevity. Some twenty-five years after it was first released to the world, Slackware is indeed still going strong. It remains a preferred Linux distribution method by many. As of this writing, it is also still being updated at a decently steady pace.

If you’re just starting to learn about Linux distribution options, you will hear about Slackware a lot. There are several reasons as to why that is the case.

An Introduction To Slackware
In order to better appreciate the longevity of Slackware, we have to cover two major subjects. First, let’s take a quick at the history of Slackware. That begins in 1993, although work began on it even earlier than that. With this foundation, we can then move on to the benefits of Slackware. These are benefits that have remained consistent through the decades. They can go a long way towards explaining the appeal of Slackware in 2019.

As of this year, Slackware is the longest-standing Linux distribution choice that is still being updated.

A Brief History Of Slackware
Working from an even older Linux distribution known as Softlanding Linux, Patrick Volkerding created Slackware in 1993. It was released to the world at large in April of that year, and it has been well-regarded and updated ever since. One of the main purposes for the creation of Slackware in the first place was to establish the most Unix-like distribution option for Linux. Many believe they have succeeded in this regard time and time again.

Both stability and simplicity in design have always been the goals of Slackware. According to Scott Chow of [Theblogstarter.com](https://www.theblogstarter.com), Slackware continues to aspire to make as few changes as humanly possible to software packages that come from the upstream. Furthermore, it also tries to avoid anticipating use cases, or precluding the decisions of the user. There is nothing in the way of a graphical procedure for installation. You also won’t find automatic dependency resolutions for any given software package. It utilizes plain text files, and utilizes a small set of shell scripts, when it comes to configuration and administration. Booting it will take you to an environment of what can be described as a common-line interface.

Slackware has been updated a few times throughout the years. Volkerding continues to spearhead these updates, which is perhaps why Slackware has maintained such impressive consistency from 1993 to the present. The most recent update was released in June of 2016—just two years ago.

As we get ready for a more detailed look at the benefits of Slackware, let’s take a quick look at some of the main Slackware features you can expect.

Slackware Features
One of the great things about Slackware is that it covers a lot of different needs right out of the gate. It is designed in such a way that you should be able to start working with it pretty quickly, and that would be regardless of your level of experience.

We won’t cover every single Slackware feature here, but let’s unpack some of the top things to expect:

• X-Window Systems
• Developmental environments for both C and C++
• The ability to use Perl
• Various utilities related to networking
• A server for mail
• A server for the web
• A server for FTP-related needs
• GNU Image Manipulation capabilities

As you can see, Slackware brings a lot to the table from the beginning. That is certainly an impressive benefit unto itself, but there are so many other potential advantages of using Slackware to keep in mind.

Slackware Benefits Explained
Ultimately, it is obviously up to you to decide if Slackware is right for your needs. The great thing about Slackware is that you will know the answer to that almost immediately. Many find it to be a straightforward collection of features that they can engage immediately. Others see management and administration of Slackware as being riddled with tedious challenges and time-consuming requirements.

For now, let’s explore some of the most commonly-cited benefits of using Slackware for Linux:

• Stability: Even the people who find Slackware to be too challenging will tell you that it at least benefits from being enormously stable. Over the course of the past twenty-five years, Slackware has continued to function without a whole lot of problems. It has moved nicely with the times, but it really hasn’t changed all that much. Few things related to computers have such stability.
• Security: Even for Linux distributions, there are traps and pitfalls that need to be constantly kept in mind. By and large, Slackware doesn’t have that problem. It probably helps that new versions of Slackware do not come out until everything is absolutely ready.
• Neutral: Remember that Slackware isn’t dependent upon a package manager. This is largely due to the fact that the applications are installed through a source. Slackware is not affiliated with any company either. Distribution was community-driven in the early 90s, and Slackware remains committed to that a quarter of a century later.
• Speediness: Another thing to keep in mind with Slackware is that it will only install what you absolutely want. Because of this, and keeping in mind the release policy we mentioned above, Slackware tends to run the fastest of the Linux distributions.
• Clean configuration: One of the big knocks against Slackware is that it doesn’t have graphical config utilities. No matter what you want to do, you are going to need to use the command line. Some people find this frustrating, but others would argue that this gives you the cleanest possible config files to work with.
• Want to understand Linux: There are other benefits to Slackware, but this one might just be our favorite. Even if you initially think Slackware has a higher learning curve than other distributions, there is a strong argument to be made that it will be worth the extra effort. Some don’t even experience this extra effort. However, if you do, think about Linux in broader terms. If you need to have a comprehensive understanding of Linux, you really can’t ask for a better teacher than Slackware. When you’ve mastered everything there is to know about Slackware, you will have pretty much mastered using Linux, as well.

Conclusion
Slackbuilds and strong IT cred are two more benefits that are worth taking to heart. At the end of the day, nothing in the world of Linux distributions can exist without a certain measure of controversy and disagreement. People also tend to be fiercely passionate and loyal about their favorite distribution. Nonetheless, Slackware has a staying power that would be absurd to ignore. It has worked for an incredibly long time, and it has done so in a field that has little time or patience for things that can’t be intensely/comprehensively useful. You could certainly make the argument that it has done more for bringing people to the world of Linux than just about anything else.

Is Slackware right for you? At this point, you are in the best position possible to make that determination. As we mentioned before, Slackware is best experienced in a hands-on capacity. You can research the subject to death, and you still won’t really know for sure. The only thing we can promise you, as we mentioned before, is that you are going to be able to decide how you feel about Slackware pretty quickly. It could be one of the best decisions you have ever made, in terms of working with a distribution that helps you meet your goals.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

Attached file
[zipped PoC (multiple files) from ZDI](attachment.cgi?id=325682)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=325682&action=edit)

ZDI submitted the following advisory to us via mail to security@mozilla.org
-- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------------------------------
TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following
products:
Mozilla Firefox 2.0.x
Mozilla Firefox 3.0.x
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS -----------------------------------------------
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page.
The specific flaw exists in the browser's handling reference counters to
the nsCSSValue:Array class. Creating more then 65,535 references will
overflow a 16-bit reference counter and therefore result in an erroneous
free() while the object still exists. Properly manipulated this can
result in arbitrary code execution under the context of the current
user.
Most reference counters are implemented as unsigned longs and can not be
feasible overflowed with too many reference. However, the
nsCSSValue::Array class uses a 16-bit wide value,
layout/style/nsCSSValue.h (lines 321-335):
void AddRef() {
++mRefCnt;
NS\_LOG\_ADDREF(this, mRefCnt, "nsCSSValue::Array", sizeof(\*this));
}
void Release() {
--mRefCnt;
NS\_LOG\_RELEASE(this, mRefCnt, "nsCSSValue::Array");
if (mRefCnt == 0)
delete this;
}
private:
PRUint16 mRefCnt;
PRUint16 mCount;
An attacker can create an arbitrary number of references to this object
by creating a style definition with counter-increment, counter-reset,
cursor or text-shadow attribute. Setting one of those attributes to an
arbitrary HTML object creates a reference to this object.
Creating more than 65535 HTML objects with reference to this style
definition will overflow the reference counter, which will lead to a
freeing of the object whilst references to it still exist.

I think we should do this here, and elsewhere in the tree.
The nsStyleStruct.{h,cpp} change shouldn't be needed on 1.9 or 1.8. I haven't yet looked to see if additional changes should be needed there.

(Note that I haven't tested this against the attached ZIP and don't plan to. I don't have Java installed. If somebody else wants to try it, you're welcome to.)

I'd be interested in other people's opinions on whether they agree with this approach (including those already cc:ed).
Also, should I hold off on checking this in to trunk? (If so, somebody else may need to land it for me.)

Note that for me on mac the testcase hung the browser for ~5minutes until I force-quit it. Is that how long it takes on windows as well?

Are the PR\_UINT32\_MAX checks necessary? Possibly on 64-bit systems, but should we use a uint64 mRefCnt there to avoid having to worry?
It's not possible on 32-bit systems to add 2^32-1 refs from JS, of course.

Yes, it took ages while it filled up memory and played games trying to force GC -- very brute-force. A motivated attacker might be able to make this more efficient and workable.
I haven't yet reproduced the claimed "launch calc.exe" PoC, but I did get shut down by Windows DEP which indicates a serious problem.

There are actually two testcases, one uses Flash and the other Java.

This is a simple html testcase that triggers the crash, without all the memory filling stuff.
This crashes after a gc, which happens after 20 seconds or so.

If we are shut down by DEP doesn't that mean we are safe from the exploit?

Only on systems with DEP available, so probably not Linux and OS X, and almost certainly not people with pre-x86-64 machines. I guess you can turn DEP off, too, for some or all applications -- not sure what the defaults are.

This didn't crash for me on Linux. It definitely causes a hang, but I left the page open for ~5min before killing the browser.

Attached file
[mRefCnt and mRefCount member variables report](attachment.cgi?id=326824)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=326824&action=edit)

This is a list of member variables named mRefCnt and mRefCount prepared using Dehydra on a Linux trunk build. The name and source location of each member is given. They are grouped by type: showing bits and S/U for signed/unsigned. In parens are given any typedefs or wrapper classes around the mValue member.
The notable stuff is near the top. The nsCSSValue::Array::mRefCnt being 16-bit unsigned is shown. There is also an Assertion::mRefCnt, which is 16-bit signed. Then there is a group of 14 variables that are 32-bit signed or unsigned that are not defined using nsrefcnt, but through PRInt32 or PRUInt32 directly, and 3 more that are nsrefcnt, but not using any wrapper. So those 17 might merit additional attention.
I'm going to search for more stuff by looking for increments inside functions with likely names and maybe broadening the name search a bit.

This is a list of class fields assigned in "refcounting methods" and the expressions used to assign them. A "refcounting method" was defined as any method with a name in:
AddRef,Release,AddReference,ReleaseReference,Hold,Drop,incr,decr
I didn't spot any bitmasking operations other than the known one in the cycle counting decr. This check did turn up a few other ref count members. I checked them out and none are 16-bit. Let me know if you want the source listing of where they are defined.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=440230&attachment=327032)

This is a minimal patch to make us safe against this problem on 32-bit systems. It's dbaron's 16-bit refcount fix, and the same fix applied to the other 16-bit refcount that dmandelin found. Once this is in we can worry about making our reference counting safe on 64-bit systems IMO, in a separate bug.

Minimal fix to make us safe on 32-bit systems.
A good start.
However, I agree with dbaron that we really should do this for all refcounts, because a bug is still triggerable if someone finds a refcount leak. We don't find too many of those these days, but still...

Agreed, but I don't think we need to solve that before landing the fix for this issue, and possibly opening this bug up. And I think when we fix that kind of problem \*anywhere\* we need to fix them across the board (as best as we can).

nice work folks (go static analysis for the coverage win!). We should land this on trunk, then on both branches in quick succession. Before doing so I'd like to understand our 2.0.0.x and 3.0.1 schedules to make sure we can push all updates fast.

 Martijn's testcase doesn't do anything on branch for me or Sam. Running the PoC case on a server, I simply get the "Warning: Unresponsive script" dialog every 20 seconds or so and nothing else happens. If I tell the script to continue, the process just repeats for another 20 seconds or so. If I stop the script, nothing happens either.
This was with Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.16pre) Gecko/2008062703 BonEcho/2.0.0.16pre.
I'm going to double-check this on Windows XP.

Minimal fix to make us safe on 32-bit systems.
This looks like it applies to the 1.8 branch, and a quick MXR shows only these two int16 mRefCnt variables. Requesting approval unless Johnny says we need a different patch.

I set dom.max\_script\_run\_time to 10,000 in about:config and tried the PoC again
on Firefox 2.0.0.14. While the script happily uses my resources, nothing else
ever happens. All it does is hang my browser. If I leave the default values for
dom.max\_script\_run\_time in place, I get a prompt to stop the script.

Do we have a cover bug under which we're going to land this? jst, are you planning on landing this tonight or tomorrow morning?

I can land whenever, but there's no cover bug. If others think we need one let me know, otherwise I can either just check in referring to this closed bug, or I can check in w/o a bug reference in the commit message.

When it works it alerts a url-escaped string, then after a pause alerts "Done", and when you click "OK" firefox disappears and calc.exe runs. It does this within the bounds of the current max script time. If it's going to work you shouldn't hit the unresponsive script dialog, or maybe once if you've got a slow or loaded machine.
I never got the PoC to work on 2.0.0.x but by code inspection it has the same problem. That probably means the PoC is sensitive to memory layout which unfortunately also means the PoC not working is not necessarily proof that we fixed it.Summary: Firefox CSSValue Array Memory Corruption Vulnerability (zdi-can-349) → Firefox CSSValue Array Memory Corruption Vulnerability

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

Firefox vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the browser engine. A variable could be made to

overflow causing the browser to crash. If a user were tricked into opening

a malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service or

possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2008-2785](/security/CVE-2008-2785))

Billy Rios discovered that Firefox did not properly perform URI splitting

with pipe symbols when passed a command-line URI. If Firefox were passed

a malicious URL, an attacker may be able to execute local content with

chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-2933](/security/CVE-2008-2933))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-626-2: Devhelp, Epiphany, Midbrowser and Yelp update

4 August 2008

Devhelp, Epiphany, Midbrowser and Yelp update

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [devhelp](/security/cves?package=devhelp) -
* [epiphany-browser](/security/cves?package=epiphany-browser) -
* [midbrowser](/security/cves?package=midbrowser) -
* [yelp](/security/cves?package=yelp) -

## Details

USN-626-1 fixed vulnerabilities in xulrunner-1.9. The changes required

that Devhelp, Epiphany, Midbrowser and Yelp also be updated to use the

new xulrunner-1.9.

Original advisory details:

A flaw was discovered in the browser engine. A variable could be made to

overflow causing the browser to crash. If a user were tricked into opening

a malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service or

possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2008-2785](/security/CVE-2008-2785))

Billy Rios discovered that Firefox and xulrunner, as used by browsers

such as Epiphany, did not properly perform URI splitting with pipe

symbols when passed a command-line URI. If Firefox or xulrunner were

passed a malicious URL, an attacker may be able to execute local

content with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-2933](/security/CVE-2008-2933))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [midbrowser](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/midbrowser)
  -
  [0.3.0rc1a-1~8.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/midbrowser/0.3.0rc1a-1~8.04.2)
* [epiphany-gecko](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/epiphany-browser)
  -
  [2.22.2-0ubuntu0.8.04.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/epiphany-browser/2.22.2-0ubuntu0.8.04.5)
* [devhelp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/devhelp)
  -
  [0.19-1ubuntu1.8.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/devhelp/0.19-1ubuntu1.8.04.3)
* [yelp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/yelp)
  -
  [2.22.1-0ubuntu2.8.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/yelp/2.22.1-0ubuntu2.8.04.2)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Devhelp, Epiphany,

Midbrowser and Yelp to effect the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2008-34

## Remote code execution by overflowing CSS reference counter

Announced
July 15, 2008
Reporter
TippingPoint Zero Day Initiative
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.16
* Firefox 3.0.1
* SeaMonkey 1.1.11
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.16

### Description

An anonymous researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative program, reported a vulnerability in Mozilla's internal CSSValue array data structure. The vulnerability was caused by an insufficiently sized variable being used as a reference counter for CSS objects. By creating a very large number of references to a common CSS object, this counter could be overflowed which could cause a crash when the browser attempts to free the CSS object while still in use. An attacker could use this crash to run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in mail.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be installed.

[Slackware](http://www.slackware.org/)

# Slackware

The story of Slackware is pretty darn interesting, when you start to dig a little deeper. Perhaps the most compelling element to the narrative is its longevity. Some twenty-five years after it was first released to the world, Slackware is indeed still going strong. It remains a preferred Linux distribution method by many. As of this writing, it is also still being updated at a decently steady pace.

If you’re just starting to learn about Linux distribution options, you will hear about Slackware a lot. There are several reasons as to why that is the case.

An Introduction To Slackware
In order to better appreciate the longevity of Slackware, we have to cover two major subjects. First, let’s take a quick at the history of Slackware. That begins in 1993, although work began on it even earlier than that. With this foundation, we can then move on to the benefits of Slackware. These are benefits that have remained consistent through the decades. They can go a long way towards explaining the appeal of Slackware in 2019.

As of this year, Slackware is the longest-standing Linux distribution choice that is still being updated.

A Brief History Of Slackware
Working from an even older Linux distribution known as Softlanding Linux, Patrick Volkerding created Slackware in 1993. It was released to the world at large in April of that year, and it has been well-regarded and updated ever since. One of the main purposes for the creation of Slackware in the first place was to establish the most Unix-like distribution option for Linux. Many believe they have succeeded in this regard time and time again.

Both stability and simplicity in design have always been the goals of Slackware. According to Scott Chow of [Theblogstarter.com](https://www.theblogstarter.com), Slackware continues to aspire to make as few changes as humanly possible to software packages that come from the upstream. Furthermore, it also tries to avoid anticipating use cases, or precluding the decisions of the user. There is nothing in the way of a graphical procedure for installation. You also won’t find automatic dependency resolutions for any given software package. It utilizes plain text files, and utilizes a small set of shell scripts, when it comes to configuration and administration. Booting it will take you to an environment of what can be described as a common-line interface.

Slackware has been updated a few times throughout the years. Volkerding continues to spearhead these updates, which is perhaps why Slackware has maintained such impressive consistency from 1993 to the present. The most recent update was released in June of 2016—just two years ago.

As we get ready for a more detailed look at the benefits of Slackware, let’s take a quick look at some of the main Slackware features you can expect.

Slackware Features
One of the great things about Slackware is that it covers a lot of different needs right out of the gate. It is designed in such a way that you should be able to start working with it pretty quickly, and that would be regardless of your level of experience.

We won’t cover every single Slackware feature here, but let’s unpack some of the top things to expect:

• X-Window Systems
• Developmental environments for both C and C++
• The ability to use Perl
• Various utilities related to networking
• A server for mail
• A server for the web
• A server for FTP-related needs
• GNU Image Manipulation capabilities

As you can see, Slackware brings a lot to the table from the beginning. That is certainly an impressive benefit unto itself, but there are so many other potential advantages of using Slackware to keep in mind.

Slackware Benefits Explained
Ultimately, it is obviously up to you to decide if Slackware is right for your needs. The great thing about Slackware is that you will know the answer to that almost immediately. Many find it to be a straightforward collection of features that they can engage immediately. Others see management and administration of Slackware as being riddled with tedious challenges and time-consuming requirements.

For now, let’s explore some of the most commonly-cited benefits of using Slackware for Linux:

• Stability: Even the people who find Slackware to be too challenging will tell you that it at least benefits from being enormously stable. Over the course of the past twenty-five years, Slackware has continued to function without a whole lot of problems. It has moved nicely with the times, but it really hasn’t changed all that much. Few things related to computers have such stability.
• Security: Even for Linux distributions, there are traps and pitfalls that need to be constantly kept in mind. By and large, Slackware doesn’t have that problem. It probably helps that new versions of Slackware do not come out until everything is absolutely ready.
• Neutral: Remember that Slackware isn’t dependent upon a package manager. This is largely due to the fact that the applications are installed through a source. Slackware is not affiliated with any company either. Distribution was community-driven in the early 90s, and Slackware remains committed to that a quarter of a century later.
• Speediness: Another thing to keep in mind with Slackware is that it will only install what you absolutely want. Because of this, and keeping in mind the release policy we mentioned above, Slackware tends to run the fastest of the Linux distributions.
• Clean configuration: One of the big knocks against Slackware is that it doesn’t have graphical config utilities. No matter what you want to do, you are going to need to use the command line. Some people find this frustrating, but others would argue that this gives you the cleanest possible config files to work with.
• Want to understand Linux: There are other benefits to Slackware, but this one might just be our favorite. Even if you initially think Slackware has a higher learning curve than other distributions, there is a strong argument to be made that it will be worth the extra effort. Some don’t even experience this extra effort. However, if you do, think about Linux in broader terms. If you need to have a comprehensive understanding of Linux, you really can’t ask for a better teacher than Slackware. When you’ve mastered everything there is to know about Slackware, you will have pretty much mastered using Linux, as well.

Conclusion
Slackbuilds and strong IT cred are two more benefits that are worth taking to heart. At the end of the day, nothing in the world of Linux distributions can exist without a certain measure of controversy and disagreement. People also tend to be fiercely passionate and loyal about their favorite distribution. Nonetheless, Slackware has a staying power that would be absurd to ignore. It has worked for an incredibly long time, and it has done so in a field that has little time or patience for things that can’t be intensely/comprehensively useful. You could certainly make the argument that it has done more for bringing people to the world of Linux than just about anything else.

Is Slackware right for you? At this point, you are in the best position possible to make that determination. As we mentioned before, Slackware is best experienced in a hands-on capacity. You can research the subject to death, and you still won’t really know for sure. The only thing we can promise you, as we mentioned before, is that you are going to be able to decide how you feel about Slackware pretty quickly. It could be one of the best decisions you have ever made, in terms of working with a distribution that helps you meet your goals.

Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2008-2785 CVE-2008-2933

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceweasel
web browser, an unbranded version of the Firefox browser. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-2785

    It was discovered that missing boundary checks on a reference
    counter for CSS objects can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-2933

    Billy Rios discovered that passing an URL containing a pipe symbol
    to Iceweasel can lead to Chrome privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.16-0etch1. Updated packages for ia64, arm and mips are
not yet available and will be released as soon as they have been built.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
xulrunner 1.9.0.1-1 and iceweasel 3.0.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch
- -------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, hppa, i386, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

## Synopsis

Moderate: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0616)

## Topic

Updated thunderbird packages that fix a security issue are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Multiple flaws were found in the processing of malformed JavaScript
content. An HTML mail containing such malicious content could cause
Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user
running Thunderbird. (CVE-2008-2801, CVE-2008-2802, CVE-2008-2803)

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed HTML content. An
HTML mail containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2008-2785, CVE-2008-2798, CVE-2008-2799, CVE-2008-2811)

Several flaws were found in the way malformed HTML content was displayed.
An HTML mail containing specially-crafted content could, potentially, trick
a Thunderbird user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-2800)

Two local file disclosure flaws were found in Thunderbird. An HTML mail
containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to reveal the contents
of a local file to a remote attacker. (CVE-2008-2805, CVE-2008-2810)

A flaw was found in the way a malformed .properties file was processed by
Thunderbird. A malicious extension could read uninitialized memory,
possibly leaking sensitive data to the extension. (CVE-2008-2807)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird escaped a listing of local file
names. If a user could be tricked into listing a local directory containing
malicious file names, arbitrary JavaScript could be run with the
permissions of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2008-2808)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird displayed information about
self-signed certificates. It was possible for a self-signed certificate to
contain multiple alternate name entries, which were not all displayed to
the user, allowing them to mistakenly extend trust to an unknown site.
(CVE-2008-2809)

Note: JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird. The above
issues are not exploitable unless JavaScript is enabled.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [mozilla-thunderbird](/security/cves?package=mozilla-thunderbird) -
* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) -

## Details

Various flaws were discovered in the browser engine. If a user had

Javascript enabled and were tricked into opening a malicious web

page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application

crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2798](/security/CVE-2008-2798), [CVE-2008-2799](/security/CVE-2008-2799))

It was discovered that Thunderbird would allow non-privileged XUL

documents to load chrome scripts from the fastload file if Javascript

was enabled. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary

Javascript code with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-2802](/security/CVE-2008-2802))

A flaw was discovered in Thunderbird that allowed overwriting trusted

objects via mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript(). If a user had

Javascript enabled and was tricked into opening a malicious web page,

an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2803](/security/CVE-2008-2803))

Daniel Glazman found that an improperly encoded .properties file in

an add-on can result in uninitialized memory being used. If a user

were tricked into installing a malicious add-on, Thunderbird may be

able to see data from other programs. ([CVE-2008-2807](/security/CVE-2008-2807))

John G. Myers discovered a weakness in the trust model used by

Thunderbird regarding alternate names on self-signed certificates.

If a user were tricked into accepting a certificate containing

alternate name entries, an attacker could impersonate another

server. ([CVE-2008-2809](/security/CVE-2008-2809))

A vulnerability was discovered in the block reflow code of

Thunderbird. If a user enabled Javascript, this vulnerability could

be used by an attacker to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2811](/security/CVE-2008-2811))

A flaw was discovered in the browser engine. A variable could be made

to overflow causing Thunderbird to crash. If a user enable Javascript

and was tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2785](/security/CVE-2008-2785))

Mozilla developers audited the MIME handling code looking for similar

vulnerabilities to the previously fixed [CVE-2008-0304](/security/CVE-2008-0304), and changed

several function calls to use safer versions of string routines.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
