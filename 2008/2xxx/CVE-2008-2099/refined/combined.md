How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### VMware Security Advisory

#####

VMware Security AdvisoryAdvisory ID:  VMSA-2008-0008 VMware Security AdvisorySynopsis:  Updates to VMware Workstation, VMware Player, VMware ACE, VMware Fusion resolve critical security issues VMware Security AdvisoryIssue date:  2008-05-30 VMware Security AdvisoryUpdated on:  2008-05-30 (initial release of advisory) VMware Security AdvisoryCVE numbers:  CVE-2008-2098 CVE-2008-2099
##### 1. Summary:

Several critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed in the newest releases of VMware's hosted product line.

#####

##### 2. Relevant releases:

VMware Workstation 6.0.3 and earlier,
VMware Player 2.0.3 and earlier,
VMware ACE 2.0.3 and earlier,
VMware Fusion 1.1.1 and earlier

NOTES: Users of VMware hosted products VMware Workstation 5.x, VMware Player 1.x, and VMware ACE 1.x should note that although they are not vulnerable to these issue, they will reach their end of general support on 2008-11-09. Customers should plan to upgrade to the latest version of their respective products.

##### 3. Problem description:

a. VMware HGFS File System Heap Overflow
The VMware Host Guest File System (HGFS) shared folders feature allows users to transfer data between a guest operating system and the non-virtualized host operating system that contains it.

A heap buffer overflow condition is present in VMware HGFS. Exploitation of this flaw might allow an unprivileged guest process to execute code in the context of the vmx process on the host.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, the VMware system must have at least one folder shared. Two things must happen for a folder to be shared. 1) Shared folders must be enabled, and 2) a folder must be selected from the host system to be shared. No folders are shared by default in any version of our products, which means this vulnerability is not exploitable by default. Workstation 6.x, Player 2.x, and ACE 2.x have shared folders disabled by default.

VMware Server, ESX and ESXi do not provide the shared folders feature. Because there is no back-end for the HGFS protocol on the virtualization host, these products are architecturally immune to this issue.

This issue might not be exploitable on host operating systems which have implemented heap protection.

VMware would like to thank Andrew Honig of the Department of Defense for reporting this issue.

The Common Vulnerabilities and exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-2098 to this issue.

#####

b. Windows based VMCI arbitrary code execution vulnerability
VMCI was introduced in VMware Workstation 6.0, VMware Player 2.0, and VMware ACE 2.0. It is an experimental, optional feature that allows virtual machines to communicate with one another.

With VMCI enabled a guest may execute arbitrary code in the context of the vmx process on the host. This is a compiler dependent vulnerability and only affects systems running on windows hosts.

VMware would like to thank Andrew Honig of the Department of Defense for reporting this issue.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-2099 to this issues.
