The provided content discusses the release of Gallery 2.2.5, which addresses several security vulnerabilities. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities Addressed in Gallery 2.2.5:**

*   **XSS through host and path component of request URL:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application did not properly sanitize the host and path components of the request URL.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the URL, which would be executed by the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL with the XSS payload embedded in the host or path.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Attacker needs to be able to entice a user to click on the malicious URL.
*   **Information disclosure in album-select module:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The album-select module exposed album titles even when a guest user was adding a new album to a hidden album.
    *  **Vulnerability:** Information disclosure
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized users could gain knowledge of hidden albums and their titles.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By exploiting the album-select module when adding a new album as a guest user.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Guest user access to the gallery.
*   **Permission escalation through zip archive extraction:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application allowed sub-albums to be created from a ZIP archive even if the user lacked the necessary permissions.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Privilege escalation
    *   **Impact:** Users could create sub-albums without proper authorization, potentially disrupting the album structure and organization.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Uploading a zip file with malicious content
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Valid user account on the Gallery application
*   **Information disclosure through embed.php:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The embed.php script was vulnerable to spoofing the remote address, leading to disclosure of the local file system path of the Gallery 2 installation.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Information Disclosure.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker could learn the file system path of the gallery which may lead to further exploitation.
    *    **Attack Vector:** Spoofing the remote address when calling embed.php.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Access to embed.php script.
*   **View permissions not enforced for password protected items:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application was offering password protection for non-album items directly, which was not fully protected as the feature only properly applied to album items.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Inconsistent Access Control
    *   **Impact:** Password protection on non-album items was not properly enforced
    *   **Attack Vector:** By directly accessing non-album items that were supposedly protected with a password.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Access to non-album items

**Additional Notes:**

*   The release also includes fixes for issues related to manifest files, which can cause issues with upgrades.
*   The update file can be used to upgrade specific core files for users of Gallery 2.2 or later (2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3 or 2.2.4)
*   The update instructions recommend that after the upgrade, users of the Password module should check if any non-album items are password protected directly in their gallery and remove the password protection on these items.
