Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2789

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in the `index.php` file of BaSiC-CMS due to improper handling of the `page_id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   SQL Injection: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the `page_id` parameter of `index.php`, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Database Exposure: An attacker could potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database by injecting SQL queries.
*   Data Manipulation: The attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
*   Privilege Escalation: In some cases, SQL injection can lead to privilege escalation within the database server or the application itself, depending on the user running the SQL queries.
*   Application Compromise: A successful attack can fully compromise the application and the underlying database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted GET request to `index.php` where the `page_id` parameter is manipulated to contain malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   Basic SQL Knowledge: The attacker must have knowledge of SQL syntax and how to form SQL injection queries to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details from Exploit:**

The exploit demonstrates the SQL injection using the following payload in the `page_id` parameter:

```
-74+union+select+1,1,1,convert(concat_ws(0x2F2A2A2F,version(),current_user,database())+using+latin1),1,1--
```
This payload, when injected into the application, attempts to retrieve database version, the current user, and the database name.

The provided exploit also includes a live demo URL where the exploit was tested.

```
http://demo.basic-cms.de/pages/index.php?r=&page_id=-74+union+select+1,1,1,convert(concat_ws(0x2F2A2A2F,version(),current_user,database())+using+latin1),1,1--
```

This exploit allows for extraction of information from the database.
