## Vulnerabilities in GDI Could Allow Remote Code Execution (956802)

Published: December 09, 2008 | Updated: December 10, 2008

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in GDI. Exploitation of either of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted WMF image file. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way GDI validates file size parameters and performs integer calculations to prevent overflow conditions. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

## GDI Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-2249

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI handles integer calculations. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted WMF image file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-2249](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2249).

#### Mitigating Factors for GDI Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-2249

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and later editions of Office.

#### Workarounds for GDI Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-2249

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Turn off metafile processing by modifying the registry**

  Customers who have applied MS07-017 or customers using Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 can disable metafile processing by modifying the registry. This setting will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  To modify the key, follow these steps:

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\GRE\_Initialize
  3. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then click **DWORD**.
  4. Type **DisableMetaFiles**, and then press ENTER.
  5. On the **Edit** menu, click **Modify** to modify the DisableMetaFiles registry entry.
  6. In the **Value data** box, type **1**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Exit Registry Editor.
  8. Reboot the computer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Turning off processing of metafiles may cause the appearance of the output from software or system components to decrease in quality. Turning off processing of metafiles may also cause software or system components to fail completely. This workaround has been identified to have a potentially significant functionality impact and should be evaluated and tested carefully to determine its applicability.

  Examples include the following:
* You cannot print on the computer.
* Some applications on the computer may be unable to display Clipart.
* Some scenarios that involve OLE rendering may break. This most often occurs when the object server is not active.

  For more information on this setting read [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 941835](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/941835).

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\GRE\_Initialize
  3. On the **Edit** menu, click **Modify** to modify the DisableMetaFiles registry entry.
  4. In the **Value** data box, type **0**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Exit Registry Editor.
  6. Reboot the computer.

  You may have to restart your computer for this change to take effect.
* **Read E-mail in Plain Text**

  To help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector, read e-mail messages in plain text format.

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for GDI Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-2249

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow when GDI improperly processes a malformed header in a specially crafted WMF image file.

**What is GDI?**

The Microsoft Windows graphics device interface (GDI) enables applications to use graphics and formatted text on both the video display and the printer. Windows-based applications do not access the graphics hardware directly. Instead, GDI interacts with device drivers on behalf of applications. For more information about GDI, visit the [Windows GDI Start Page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms536795.aspx).

**What is the Windows Metafile (WMF) image format?**

The WMF image format is a 16-bit metafile format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. It is optimized for the Windows operating system.

For more information about image types and formats, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320314](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/320314). Additional information about these file formats is also available at the [MSDN Library Web Site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/gdicpp/gdiplus/aboutgdiplus/imagesbitmapsandmetafiles/metafiles.asp).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user view a specially crafted image file.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an e-mail with a specially-crafted WMF image file embedded in it to the user and convincing the user to view or preview the email. An attacker could also embed a specially-crafted WMF image file in an Office document and convince the user to open the file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a WMF image file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way GDI performs integer calculations to prevent an overflow condition.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. This security bulletin addresses the privately disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## GDI Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3465

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI handles file size parameters in WMF files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a third-party application uses a specific Microsoft API to copy a specially crafted WMF image file.

#### FAQ for GDI Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3465

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by a heap overflow when GDI improperly processes a malformed file size parameter in a specially crafted WMF image file.

**What is GDI?**

The Microsoft Windows graphics device interface (GDI) enables applications to use graphics and formatted text on both the video display and the printer. Windows-based applications do not access the graphics hardware directly. Instead, GDI interacts with device drivers on behalf of applications. For more information about GDI, visit the [Windows GDI Start Page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms536795.aspx).

**What is the Windows Metafile (WMF) image format?**

The WMF image format is a 16-bit metafile format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. It is optimized for the Windows operating system.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected application to become non-responsive. The application would need to be restarted to restore functionality.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires a third-party application make a copy of a WMF file through this API. Depending on the behavior of the third-party application, this could lead to remote code execution in the context of the logged on user.

We are not currently aware of any remote avenues for accessing this vulnerability using Microsoft products.

**How do I determine if a third party application is affected?**

Users are encouraged to contact their third-party software vendors whose products process or potentially copy WMF files to determine if they are affected.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All currently supported Windows systems are at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way GDI handles file size parameters to prevent buffer overflow conditions.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. This security bulletin addresses the privately disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

## Research Statement and Overview

Binary analysis is imperative for protecting COTS (common
off-the-shelf) programs and analyzing and defending against the myriad
of malicious code, where source code is unavailable, and the binary
may even be obfuscated. Also, binary analysis provides the ground
truth about program behavior since computers execute binaries
(executables), not source code. However, binary analysis is
challenging due to the lack of higher-level semantics.
Many higher level
techniques are often inadequate for analyzing even benign binaries,
let alone potentially malicious binaries.
Thus, we need to develop tools and techniques which work at the
binary level, can be used for analyzing COTS software, as well as malicious binaries.

The *BitBlaze* project aims to design and develop a powerful
binary analysis platform and employ the platform in order to (1) analyze and develop novel
COTS protection and diagnostic mechanisms and (2) analyze,
understand, and develop defenses against malicious code. The
BitBlaze project also strives to open new application areas of
binary analysis, which provides sound and effective solutions to
applications beyond software security and malicious code defense,
such as protocol reverse engineering and fingerprint generation.

**The BitBlaze project consists of two central research directions: (1)
the design and development of the underlying BitBlaze Binary Analysis
Platform, and (2) applying the BitBlaze Binary Analysis Platform to
real security problems.** The two research focii drive each other: as
new security problems arise, we develop new analysis
techniques. Similarly, we develop new analysis techniques in order to
better or more efficiently solve known problems. Below, we give an
overview of the two research directions.

**[Here](http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/bitblaze_iciss08.pdf)** is an overview paper of the BitBlaze project.
Some of our tools are also [available under an open-source license](release/index.html).

## The BitBlaze Binary Analysis Platform
The underlying BitBlaze Binary Analysis
Platform features a novel fusion of static and dynamic analysis
techniques, dynamic symbolic execution, and whole-system
emulation and binary instrumentation. The BitBlaze platform has
different components for each task: *Vine*, *TEMU*, and
*Rudder*. The three components in tandem provide the power for
effective analysis of real-world binary programs for various
applications.

* [Vine](vine.html), the static analysis
  component.
  **Open source release [available now](vine.html).**
  Vine provides an an intermediate language for
  assembly (ILA), and an infrastructure for analyzing programs
  written in this language. ILA is a full language in
  which programs can be written, type-checked, then compiled
  down to assembly. We also provide analysis on the
  ILA, such as abstract interpretation, dependency analysis, and
  logical analysis via interfaces with theorem provers.
* [TEMU](temu.html), the dynamic analysis
  component.
  **Open source release [available now](temu.html).**
  TEMU provides a dynamic analysis environment
  through whole-system emulation and dynamic binary
  instrumentation. TEMU is OS-aware (i.e., it understands
  OS-level semantics) and enables various fine-grained
  dynamic analysis to build upon, such as dynamic taint
  analysis and fine-grained behavioral analysis.
* [Rudder](rudder.html), the component for online
  dynamic symbolic execution. Rudder is an engine for
  online dynamic execution on binaries. At a
  high level, with a specified set of input sources of
  interest, Rudder can automatically explore different
  execution paths in a program determined by the input
  sources. It will automatically build logical formulas
  representing the constraints on the chosen input to take the
  followed paths.

**[Release Information](release/index.html)**:
We are now making some key parts of the BitBlaze Binary
Analysis Platform available under open-source licenses.
See a [separate page](release/index.html) for more
information.

In conjunction with our BlackHat 2010 presentation, we have also
made a demonstration binary
[release](release/blackhat-2010.html) of some tools for
trace-based crash analysis.

## BitBlaze in Action: Security Applications

Using the BitBlaze Binary Analysis Platform, we have enabled new approaches and solutions to a suite of different security problems. These results demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the BitBlaze approach and vision---binary analysis enables fundamentally new approaches to a broad spectrum of different security problems, often solving problems at their root cause; the underlying BitBlaze Binary Analysis Platform is extensible and powerful for a broad spectrum of different security applications.

In particular, we show below three classes of security applications: (1)  [vulnerability detection, diagnosis, and defense](#vuldetect); (2) [automatic in-depth malware analysis and defense](#malwareanalysis); (3) [automatic model extraction and analysis](#model).

* ### Vulnerability Detection, Diagnosis, and Defense

  + **Hybrid Information- and Control-Flow Graph (HI-CFG)**

    Many security analysis tasks require understanding the high-level
    structure of a binary program in terms of both its control-flow and
    the data it operates on. To facilitate the automatic reverse
    engineering of such structure, we have introduced a new program
    representation, a [hybrid information- and
    control-flow graph (HI-CFG)](./hicfg/). Our research explores algorithms to
    infer a HI-CFG from an instruction-level trace, without requiring
    source-level information or static analysis.
  + **Identifying Causal Execution Differences for Security Applications**

    A security analyst often needs to understand
    two runs of the same program that exhibit a difference in
    program state or output. This is important, for example, for
    vulnerability analysis, as well as for analyzing a malware
    program that features different behaviors when run in different
    environments.

    **[Differential Slicing](diffslicing.html)** is
    an automatic slicing technique for the analysis of such
    execution differences. The  *causal difference graph*
    it outputs captures the input differences that triggered
    the observed difference and the causal path of differences
    that led from those input differences to the observed difference.
  + **Automatic Defense System against Zero-day Exploits and Worms**

    Worms such as CodeRed and SQL Slammer can compromise
    millions of hosts within hours or even minutes and have
    caused billions of dollars in estimated damage. How can
    we design and develop effective defense mechanisms
    against such fast, large scale worm attacks?

    **[Sting](sting.html)** is an automatic
    worm defense system which proposes a suite of novel
    techniques to automatically detect new exploits, perform
    in-depth diagnosis, and generate effective anti-bodies
    (vulnerability signatures and hardened binaries) to
    protect vulnerable hosts and networks from further
    attacks.
  + **Automatic Patch-based Exploit Generation**

    Security patches are supposed to fix vulnerabilities in
    programs. But what are the security implications of a
    security patch?

    In **[this](apeg.html)** work, we propose new
    techniques and demonstrate that one could automatically
    generate exploits from the patch binary and the original
    vulnerable program binary and sometimes in minutes of time.
  + **Loop-extended Symbolic Execution: Buffer Overflow Diagnosis and Discovery**

    [**Loop-extended symbolic
    execution**](lese.html) (or LESE) is a new technique that
    generalizes the results of previous dynamic symbolic
    execution techniques, which broadens the results with
    effects of loops. LESE is a key enabler for powerful
    automated discovery of security vulnerabilities, especially
    buffer-overflows, which is highly inefficient with pure
    symbolic/concrete execution. It also enables deeper
    diagnosis of known vulnerabilities, which allows automated
    signature generation tools to reason about variable-length
    input or repeated elements in the input.
  + **Measuring Quantitative Influence**

    Dynamic taint analysis is a fundamental tool for detecting
    overwrite attacks, but it is limited to an all-or-nothing
    distinction as to whether values are under the control of an
    attacker, and suffers from both false-positive and
    false-negative errors.

    We propose [**quantitative
    influence**](influence.html) to more precisely characterize the degree of
    control an attacker has over a value. A specialization of
    the concept of channel capacity from information theory, we
    show that quantitative influence can be computed precisely
    using a decision procedure. Quantitative influence
    accurately distinguishes real attacks from false positives
    among warnings generated by a dynamic taint analysis tool on
    vulnerable binary servers.
  + **Statically-Directed Dynamic Automated Test Generation**

    Static analysis, dynamic analysis, and symbolic execution
    have complementary strengths for exploring the space of
    program executions, but on its own each has significant
    limitations. How can we combine them to leverage the best
    features of all three?

    Our work on [**statically-directed
    dynamic automated test generation**](sdse-testgen.html) explores a three-stage
    process. It first performs dynamic analysis to build a
    control-flow model, then performs static analysis to search
    for potential vulnerabilities, and finally uses dynamic
    symbolic execution to prove that warnings are true positives
    by finding concrete test cases for them. In an evaluation on
    a suite of buffer-overflow benchmarks extracted from real
    applications, the results of the first two phases allowed
    symbolic execution to trigger vulnerabilities it otherwise
    could not, including all but one of the benchmarks.* ### Automatic Malware Analysis and Defense

    + **Detection and
      Analysis of Privacy-Breaching Malware**

      A myriad of malware such as keyloggers, Browser-helper
      Objects (BHO) based spyware, rootkits, backdoors, accesses
      and leaks users' sensitive information and breaches
      users' privacy. Can we have a unified approach to
      identify such privacy-breaching malware despite their
      widely-varied appearance?

      **[Panorama](panorama.html)** proposes a
      unified approach to detect privacy-breaching malware
      using whole-system dynamic taint analysis.
    + **Hidden Code Extraction from Packed Executables**

      Code packing is one technique commonly used to hinder malware
      code analysis through reverse engineering. Even though this problem
      has been previously researched, the existing solutions are
      either unable to handle novel samples, or vulnerable to various
      evasion techniques.

      **[Renovo](renovo.html)**
      proposes a fully dynamic approach for hidden code extraction,
      capturing an intrinsic nature of hidden code execution.
    + **Detection and Analysis of Malware Hooking Behaviors**

      One important malware attacking vector is its hooking mechanism. Malicious programs implant hooks for many different purposes. Spyware may implant hooks to get notified of the arrival of new sensitive data. Rootkits may implant
      hooks to intercept and tamper with critical system information to
      conceal their presence in the system. A stealth backdoor may also place hooks on
      the network stack to establish a stealthy communication channel with remote attackers.

      **[HookFinder](hookfinder.html)**
      proposes  *fine-grained impact analysis*  to automatically detect and analyze malware's hooking behaviors. Since this technique captures the intrinsic nature of hooking behaviors, it is well suited for identifying new hooking mechanisms.
    + **Automatic Malware
      Dissection and Trigger-based Behavior
      Analysis**

      Malware often has embedded behavior which is only
      exhibited when certain conditions are met. Such
      trigger-based behavior includes time bombs, logic bombs,
      and botnets programs which reacts to commands. Static
      analysis of malware often provides little utility due to
      code packing and obfuscation. Vanilla dynamic analysis
      can only provides limited view since the trigger
      conditions are usually not met. How can we design
      automatic analysis methods to uncover the trigger
      conditions and trigger-based behavior hidden in malware?

      **[BitScope](bitscope.html)** enables
      automatic exploration of program execution paths in
      malware to uncover trigger conditions (such as the time
      used in time bombs and commands in botnet programs) and
      trigger-based behavior, using dynamic symbolic
      execution. BitScope also provides in-depth analysis of
      the input/output behavior of the malware.* ### Automatic Model Extraction and Analysis

      + **Extracting security-related models from browsers for analysis and vulnerability discovery**

        In **[this](http://webblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/2009/content-sniffing/)** work, we show how to use [string-enhanced white-box exploration](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-36.html) techniques to automatically extract security-related models from browsers and to automatically discover cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by comparing the extracted models with websites' filters.

        + **Deviation
          Detection in Binaries**

          Many network protocols and services have several
          different implementations. Automatically identifying
          deviations in different implementations of the same
          protocol/service can enable the detection of potential
          implementation errors without protocol specification, and
          can enable automatic generation of fingerprints to
          identify an implementation remotely. How can we
          automatically identify such deviations in binaries
          implementing the same specification?

          **[Deviation Detection](deviation.html)**
          automatically identifies deviations in different
          binaries to detect implementation errors and generate
          fingerprints. It is achieved by building symbolic formulas
          that characterize how each binary processes an input.
        + **Protocol Reverse
          Engineering and Application Dialogue
          Replay**

          Many network protocols are proprietary or have no well
          documented specification. However, many security
          applications require protocol reverse engineering and
          application dialogue (network trace) replay.

          **[Dispatcher, Polygot and
          Replayer](protocol.html)** automatically extract information about
          network protocols and enables application dialogue replay
          using binary analysis.

## BitBlaze in the News: Vulnerabilities and Coverage

### FPGate project got Microsoft BlueHat Prize Contest's Special Recognition Award in 2012.

> FPGate stops attacks targeting function pointers by limiting indirect transfers to only those targets that are legal in the original program. When deployed together with other existing lightweight protections, FPGate can provide a level of protection comparable to CFI (Control Flow Integrity), stopping almost all control fow hijacking attacks including ROP. FPGate has two main advantages compared with previous solutions: it can inter-operate well with existing non-hardened libraries, so it can be deployed progressively; we also develop a method to recognize all sources and targets automatically in modern security-sensitive binary executables, thus FPGate can be applied directly on these binary files. The performance overhead of FPGate is only 0.36% in average measured using SPECint 2006. FPGate is a joint work of Lenx with Chao Zhang, Zhaofeng Chen, Lei Duan from Peking University, and Laszlo Szekeres, Stephen McCamant, Dawn Song from UC Berkeley.
