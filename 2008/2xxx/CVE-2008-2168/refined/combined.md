How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

It was discovered that Apache did not sanitize the method specifier header from

an HTTP request when it is returned in an error message, which could result in

browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the

output. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into

viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as

passwords), within the same domain. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and

7.10. ([CVE-2007-6203](/security/CVE-2007-6203))

It was discovered that Apache was vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery

(CSRF) in the mod\_proxy\_balancer balancer manager. If an Apache administrator

were tricked into clicking a link on a specially crafted web page, an attacker

could trigger commands that could modify the balancer manager configuration.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2007-6420](/security/CVE-2007-6420))

It was discovered that Apache had a memory leak when using mod\_ssl with

compression. A remote attacker could exploit this to exhaust server memory,

leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 7.10.

([CVE-2008-1678](/security/CVE-2008-1678))

It was discovered that in certain conditions, Apache did not specify a default

character set when returning certain error messages containing UTF-7 encoded

data, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting

attacks when processing the output. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and

7.10. ([CVE-2008-2168](/security/CVE-2008-2168))

It was discovered that when configured as a proxy server, Apache did not limit

the number of forwarded interim responses. A malicious remote server could send

a large number of interim responses and cause a denial of service via memory

exhaustion. ([CVE-2008-2364](/security/CVE-2008-2364))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ftp did not sanitize wildcard pathnames when

they are returned in directory listings, which could result in browsers becoming

vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output.

([CVE-2008-2939](/security/CVE-2008-2939))
