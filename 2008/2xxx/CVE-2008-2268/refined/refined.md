Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an improper handling of user-supplied input in the `mjguest.php` script, specifically within the `redirect` functionality. It appears that the script doesn't properly sanitize or validate the `level` and `goto` parameters, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `level` parameter is vulnerable to XSS. By injecting JavaScript code within this parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the user's browser.
*   **Open Redirection:** The `goto` parameter is vulnerable to open redirection. An attacker can redirect users to an arbitrary URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can potentially steal cookies, hijack user sessions, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions within the user's browser by injecting malicious scripts.
*   **Open Redirection:** An attacker can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially for phishing attacks or malware distribution. The attacker also has the possibility to get admin sessions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious URL that is sent to the victim via a link. The malicious URL utilizes the `do`, `level`, `alert`, and `goto` parameters in the `mjguest.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely. They do not need to be on the same network as the victim.
*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL with the correct parameters.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable script is `mjguest 6.7 (ALL VERSION)`.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by IRCRASH (Dr.Crash Or Khashayar Fereidani).
*   The provided example URL demonstrates how to inject JavaScript code into the `level` parameter and redirect to an arbitrary URL using the `goto` parameter.
