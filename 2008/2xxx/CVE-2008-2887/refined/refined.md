Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-2887:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `index.php` file of FubarForum v1.5. Specifically, the `page` parameter received through the GET method is directly used in file inclusion without sufficient validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application uses user-supplied input from the `page` parameter to include local files. The code first checks if the file exists, and then uses include to include the file.
*   The use of `file_exists` check and subsequent include means that an attacker can supply a path to include any file, so long as it exists.
*   **Null Byte Injection:** The application uses the `file_exists()` check with a filename that is controlled by an attacker before including that file. However, it does not sanitize the input, allowing for null bytes (`%00`) to be appended to the file path. This can effectively truncate the file path, enabling the inclusion of arbitrary local files, bypassing the `.php` extension check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can read the content of any local file on the server that the web server user has access to (e.g. /etc/passwd), potentially including sensitive data, such as passwords and configuration files.
*   **Remote Code Execution (potentially):** While not directly stated, by including a PHP file with malicious content it could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution by injecting code through the vulnerable include function.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php`. The attacker provides the path to the desired file via the `page` parameter, using directory traversal (`../`) and null byte injection (`%00`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable web server hosting the FubarForum application.
*   **Basic HTTP Understanding:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft GET requests with parameters.
*   **Knowledge of Server-Side File Paths:** The attacker needs some idea of the server's file system to be able to target specific files.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippets are:
    ```php
    if (!empty($_GET['page'])) { $page = $_GET['page']; }
    if (file_exists("./".$page.".php")) {
    include("./".$page.".php");
    }
    ```
*   The exploit examples given are:
    ```
    http://[host]/[fubarforum_path]/index.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd%00
    http://[host]/[fubarforum_path]/index.php?page=../../../../[local_file]%00
    ```

This exploit allows a user to include local files from the server by specifying the path through the GET parameter "page". The use of `%00` allows the inclusion of file that does not end with ".php".
