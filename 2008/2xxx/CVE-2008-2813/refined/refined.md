Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
- It is located in the `index.php` file of SHOUTcast Admin Panel 2.0.
- The script uses a `$_GET['page']` parameter to include files, and does not properly sanitize this input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application includes files based on user-controlled input via the `page` parameter without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Reading:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the server, such as `/etc/passwd` or other configuration files, by manipulating the `page` parameter. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive system information or user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` script.
- **Manipulated `page` parameter:** The `page` parameter in the URL is manipulated to include a path to the file the attacker wants to access. Path traversal sequences like `../../` are used to navigate outside the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable SHOUTcast Admin Panel instance.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the following code snippet:

   ```php
   if (isset($_GET['page']))
      $page = $_GET['page'];
   else
      $page = "main";
   ...
   <?PHP if(!include("pages/".$page.".php"))
      {
         // Error handling
      }
    ?>
   ```

- An attacker could exploit this with a URL like `http://192.168.24.25/wallcity/index.php?page=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit database entry also mentions a related CVE-2008-2814, indicating a potential cluster of vulnerabilities.
- The exploit author provided a Proof of Concept (POC) for the exploit.

In summary, CVE-2008-2813 is a Local File Inclusion vulnerability in SHOUTcast Admin Panel 2.0 that allows attackers to read sensitive files from the server using a manipulated `page` parameter.
