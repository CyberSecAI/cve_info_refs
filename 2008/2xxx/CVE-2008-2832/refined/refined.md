```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application allows arbitrary file uploads without proper validation or sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can upload malicious ASP files, such as web shells, to the server. This could lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.
- Attack vectors: An attacker can upload a malicious file through the vulnerable form on `calendar_admin.asp?action=uploadfile`.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable page and upload files to the server.
