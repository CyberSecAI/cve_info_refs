The provided content from Exploit Database describes vulnerabilities in JaxUltraBB version 2.0 and mentions both CVE-2008-2965 and CVE-2008-2966. However, it primarily focuses on the details of the vulnerabilities and exploits associated with the software and provides limited information that would be specifically linked to CVE-2008-2965. Therefore, I will provide the information related to both vulnerabilities based on this source.

**Vulnerabilities:**
   *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
        *   **Root Cause**: The `viewprofile.php` script uses user-supplied input from the `$_GET['user']` parameter to construct file paths without proper sanitization. The application uses `file_get_contents()` to read the files based on the user-supplied input.
        *   **Weakness**:  Lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to access files outside of the intended directory. The code also uses .JaxSQL as an extension without proper validation, making it possible to bypass the extension.
        *   **Impact**: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially including sensitive configuration files, system files (like boot.ini or /etc/passwd) or source code.
        *   **Attack Vector**: By sending a crafted HTTP GET request with a malicious `user` parameter.
        *   **Required Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

   *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
       *   **Root Cause**: The `viewforum.php` script directly uses user-supplied input from the `$_GET['forum']` parameter within the HTML output.
       *   **Weakness**: Lack of input sanitization and encoding for the `forum` parameter in `viewforum.php` allows injection of malicious JavaScript code.
       *   **Impact**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks, redirection or malware deployment.
       *   **Attack Vector**: By sending a crafted HTTP GET request with malicious Javascript code in the `forum` parameter.
       *    **Required Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and the victim must be able to access the crafted URL.

**Additional Notes**:
* The exploit examples use the `%00` null byte to truncate the file path, which is a common technique to bypass file extension checks in older PHP versions.
* The content provided links CVE-2008-2966 to this exploit description along with CVE-2008-2965, which may indicate that multiple vulnerabilities were discovered and/or disclosed at the same time for the same software.
