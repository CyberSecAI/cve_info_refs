  "CVE-2008-2950": {
    "description": "The Poppler PDF rendering library suffers from a memory management issue in the Page class constructor/destructor. The pageWidgets object is not initialized in the Page constructor if specific conditions are met, but it is deleted afterwards in the destructor regardless of its initialization.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "Poppler <= 0.8.4",
      "app-text/poppler < 0.6.3-r1",
      "Ubuntu poppler versions < 0.6.4-1ubuntu3.1 on Ubuntu 8.04",
      "Ubuntu poppler versions < 0.6-0ubuntu2.3 on Ubuntu 7.10"
    ],
    "fixed_versions": [
      "Poppler >= 0.8.5",
      "app-text/poppler >= 0.6.3-r1",
       "Ubuntu poppler versions >= 0.6.4-1ubuntu3.1 on Ubuntu 8.04",
      "Ubuntu poppler versions >= 0.6-0ubuntu2.3 on Ubuntu 7.10"
     ],
    "root_cause": "The `pageWidgets` object within the `Page` class is not always initialized in the constructor. Specifically, when processing annotations from a PDF file, if the annotation type is incorrect, initialization is skipped. However, the destructor for the `Page` class attempts to `delete pageWidgets` regardless of whether it was initialized, leading to a use-after-free or double free.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized pointer",
      "Use-after-free",
        "Double-free",
      "Memory management vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could craft a malicious PDF file that, when opened by a user using an application that utilizes the vulnerable Poppler library, can cause arbitrary code execution with the user's privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted PDF file",
      "User interaction required"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to entice a user to open a malicious PDF file using a Poppler-based viewer or application. No other specific capabilities or access is required."
