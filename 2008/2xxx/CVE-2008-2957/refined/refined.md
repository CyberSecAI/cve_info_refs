Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2008-2957:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of resource limitations within Pidgin's Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Resource Control:** Pidgin's UPnP service doesn't impose restrictions on the amount of data it downloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause Pidgin to download excessive data.
*   **Memory Exhaustion:** The excessive downloads can lead to memory exhaustion.
*   **Disk Space Exhaustion:**  Alternatively, the excessive data can exhaust disk space.
*   **Crash:** The exhaustion of resources could lead to Pidgin crashing, causing a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious UPnP Server:** A malicious UPnP server is the attack vector.
*   **UPnP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted request to Pidgin via a malicious UPnP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **Malicious UPnP Server:** Requires the ability to set up and control a malicious UPnP server.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the network where the vulnerable Pidgin client is running, or the Pidgin client needs to be configured to allow UPnP traffic from outside.

**Summary:**

CVE-2008-2957 details a vulnerability where Pidgin's UPnP service lacks resource management, allowing a malicious UPnP server to send requests that force Pidgin to download arbitrary files. This can lead to memory or disk space exhaustion, ultimately causing a denial-of-service.

The information provided by the various sources is consistent with the official description of the vulnerability.
