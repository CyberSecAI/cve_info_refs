Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.\n\nDelivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.\n\nSecunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.\n\nThe team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.\n\nInforming IT, Transforming IT\n\n## Industry insights to help keep you informed\n\n[#### Webinar\n\n### Stay Ahead of Cyber Threats: Flexera's Latest Vulnerability Insights\n\nJoin us for this session where we'll explore the latest findings from the Flexera Monthly Vulnerability Insights Report.](https://info.flexera.com/SVM-WBNR-Vulnerability-Insights-Roundtable)\n\n[#### Webinar\n\n### Dive deeper into the Flexera Annual Vulnerability Insights\n\nWe'll explore the key findings from the Flexera Annual Vulnerability Insights Report.
