Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2364:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `ap_proxy_http_process_response()` function within the `mod_proxy_http.c` file of the Apache HTTP Server's `mod_proxy` module.
*   The function does not limit the number of forwarded interim responses (1xx HTTP status codes), leading to potential resource exhaustion.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is a DoS condition. By sending a large number of interim responses, a malicious server could cause the Apache proxy server to consume excessive CPU, memory, or stack resources.
*   **Memory Consumption:** Unbounded processing of interim responses can cause a memory buildup on the proxy server.
*  **Stack Exhaustion:**  Processing each interim response consumes stack space, potentially leading to stack overflow if too many responses are received.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation can render the Apache proxy server unresponsive, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
*   **Server Crash:**  In cases of excessive stack consumption, the httpd child process could crash.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** CPU, memory, or stack resources of the proxy server can be exhausted, impacting other services.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote HTTP Servers:**  A malicious server, to which the Apache proxy server forwards requests, can send a flood of 1xx (interim) responses.
*   **Forward Proxy Configuration:** The vulnerability is most easily triggered in a forward proxy configuration where the user can be coerced into accessing a malicious origin server through the proxy.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control of a Remote Server:** The attacker must control a server that the vulnerable Apache instance is configured to proxy to.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Responses:**  The attacker's controlled server needs to send specially crafted HTTP responses containing multiple interim (1xx) status codes.

**Additional Notes from the provided Content:**

*   **Red Hat:** Red Hat identifies two separate issues: a stack exhaustion/CPU consumption issue affecting more versions, and a heap exhaustion issue affecting later versions, within the same CVE. Red Hat also states that a forward proxy setup (where requests are proxied to arbitrary servers) is needed to trigger the exploit. Reverse proxy setups to trusted internal servers are typically not affected.
*   **Gentoo:** Gentoo lists CVE-2008-2364, alongside other CVEs, as part of a security advisory for Apache, noting the DoS impact due to the unbounded responses.
*  **Ubuntu:**  Ubuntu notes the vulnerability regarding a proxy server not limiting forwarded interim responses, leading to DoS through memory exhaustion.
*  **openSUSE:** openSUSE identifies the vulnerability as a DoS condition in Apache's mod_proxy.
*  **HP-UX:** HP indicates the vulnerability is related to a remote DoS in their Apache-based web server.
*   **Apple:** Apple identifies this as a vulnerability within Apache 2.2.8 that has been fixed by upgrading to 2.2.9.

**Summary of Key Details:**

This vulnerability is a denial-of-service flaw in the Apache HTTP Server's `mod_proxy` module. By leveraging the unbounded handling of interim HTTP responses, an attacker in control of a remote server can force an Apache proxy server into resource exhaustion or a crash. This mostly affects deployments where Apache is used as a forward proxy where the target server is not trusted.
