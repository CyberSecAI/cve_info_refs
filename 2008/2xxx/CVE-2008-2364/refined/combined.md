1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- vim, gvim
The VI Improved editor (vim) was prone to several security problems:
CVE-2008-4677: The netrw plugin sent credentials to all servers.
CVE-2008-2712: Arbitrary code execution in vim helper plugins
filetype, zip, xpm, gzip and netrw.
CVE-2008-3074: tarplugin code injection
CVE-2008-3075: zipplugin code injection
CVE-2008-3076: several netrw bugs, code injection
CVE-2008-6235: code injection in the netrw plugin
CVE-2008-4677: credential disclosure by netrw plugin
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
On openSUSE vim was upgraded to version 7.2.108 to fix those issues.
SLES9 and 10 were only affected by a subset, patches were backported
to fix the problems.
- apache2
A DoS condition in apache2's mod\_proxy has been fixed
(CVE-2008-2364).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3
- opera
Opera 9.64 is a recommended security and stability upgrade,
incorporating the Opera Presto 2.1.1 user agent engine. Opera highly
recommends all users to upgrade to Opera 9.64 to take advantage of
these improvements (CVE-2009-0914, CVE-2009-0915, CVE-2009-0916).
A detailed changelog can be found at
<http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/964/>
- multipath tools
/var/run/multipathd.sock was world-writable allowing local users to
issue commands to the multipath daemon (CVE-2009-0115).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES10
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
Specially crafted image files could cause an integer overflow in the
lcms library contained in openjdk. Attackers could potentially
exploit that to crash applications using lcms or even execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0581, CVE-2009-0733).
Previous update packages contained broken dependencies and couldn't
be installed. Therefore the update had to be re-released.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1
- imp
Version update to IMP 4.1.6 fixes a problem with validating HTTP requests that
allowed attackers to delete emails (CVE-2007-6018) and some
cross-site-scripting issues (CVE-2009-0930).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- horde
Version update to horde 3.1.9 fixes a cross-site-scripting (XSS) issue
(CVE-2008-5917) and an include file problem (CVE-2009-0932).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- lcms
Specially crafted image files could cause an integer overflow in
lcms. Attackers could potentially exploit that to crash applications
using lcms or even execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0723,
CVE-2009-0581, CVE-2009-0733).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
- moodle
moodle was prone to several cross-site-scripting (XSS) and
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) problems (CVE-2009-0499, CVE-2009-0500,
CVE-2009-0501, CVE-2009-0502).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- ghostscript
Integer overflows and missing upper bounds checks in Ghostscript's
ICC library potentially allowed attackers to crash Ghostscript or
even cause execution of arbitrary code via specially crafted PS or
PDF files (CVE-2009-0583, CVE-2009-0584).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES9, SLES10

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- NetworkManager
The NetworkManager update caused WLAN to stop working on some
systems. Those systems most likely have a stale directory
/var/run/dbus/at\_console/root. It's most likely a leftover from a
root session. Removing the directory and restarting networking
should fix the problems. Please avoid logging in as root in the future.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

# Apache: Denial of service — GLSA **200807-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Apache might lead to a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.9** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache:

* Dustin Kirkland reported that the mod\_ssl module can leak memory when
  the client reports support for a compression algorithm (CVE-2008-1678).
* Ryujiro Shibuya reported that the ap\_proxy\_http\_process\_response()
  function in the mod\_proxy module does not limit the number of forwarded
  interim responses (CVE-2008-2364).
* sp3x of SecurityReason reported a Cross-Site Request Forgery
  vulnerability in the balancer-manager in the mod\_proxy\_balancer module
  (CVE-2007-6420).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by connecting to
an Apache httpd, by causing an Apache proxy server to connect to a
malicious server, or by enticing a balancer administrator to connect to
a specially-crafted URL, resulting in a Denial of Service of the Apache
daemon.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.2.9"
```
### References

Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=451615#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-06-16 07:43:50 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2008-2364](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-2364) to the following vulnerability:  The ap_proxy_http_process_response function in mod_proxy_http.c in the mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.63 and 2.2.8 does not limit the number of forwarded interim responses, which allows remote HTTP servers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large number of interim responses.  Fixed upstream in: 2.2.9   <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/CHANGES_2.2.9>  Upsteam patch in 2.2.x branch:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=666154>  Other references: <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/29653> <http://www.frsirt.com/english/advisories/2008/1798> <http://secunia.com/advisories/30621> <http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/42987>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=451615#c3)  Joe Orton    2008-06-24 08:54:16 UTC  ``` There are two separate issues here:  1) a stack exhaustion and CPU consumption issue.  This affects all upstream httpd 2.0.x releases from through to 2.0.63, and 2.2.0 through to 2.2.8.    Whilst reading interim responses, CPU consumption is O(N^2) with number of responses read, and for each response the stack space required is O(N) likewise.  This presents a denial of service attack either by CPU consumption or by the eventual process crash due to stack limit being reached.  2) a heap exhaustion issue.  This affects upstream httpd releases 2.2.7 and 2.2.8 only. This presents a denial of service by heap exhaustion.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2 is not affected by either of these issues.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5 are affected by issue (1) only.  Fedora 8 and 9 are affected by both (1) and (2) as of the most recent 2.2.8 updates.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=451615#c4)  Joe Orton    2008-06-24 09:56:08 UTC  ``` Note that both these issues only affect a forward proxy configuration; where a user can be coerced into accessing a malicious origin server through the proxy, that server attack the proxy as described above.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=451615#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2008-06-24 15:04:34 UTC  ``` We do not plan to issue an asynchronous RHSA at the moment because of this issue, due to a limited impact.  This issue can cause high CPU consumption, or stack overflow (exhaustion of stack memory, not stack-based buffer overflow) causing a crash of httpd child process.  With default MPM - worker MPM - such crash can only impact requests of one particular user.  Additionally, as the issue can only be triggered by a malicious web server to which requests are proxied, impact on the typical use of mod_proxy module is quite minimal.  mod_proxy is usually used in reverse proxy setups, where requests are proxied to trusted (internal) web servers.  Forward proxy setups, where requests can be proxied to arbitrary web server, are not very common, due to a lack of caching support.  Squid web proxy is more commonly used in such cases.  We plan to fix this issue in some future httpd update once there is some higher-severity issue to be fixed.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=451615#c10)  Fedora Update System    2008-08-07 23:48:01 UTC  ``` httpd-2.2.9-1.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=451615#c11)  Fedora Update System    2008-08-07 23:57:13 UTC  ``` httpd-2.2.9-1.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=451615#c13)  Mark J. Cox    2008-10-28 11:13:09 UTC  ```  Release note added. If any revisions are required, please set the  "requires_release_notes" flag to "?" and edit the "Release Notes" field accordingly. All revisions will be proofread by the Engineering Content Services team.  New Contents: A flaw was found in the mod_proxy module.  An attacker who has control of a web server to which requests are being proxied could cause a limited denial of service due to CPU consumption and stack exhaustion.  ([CVE-2008-2364](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-2364))   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=451615#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-04 21:31:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 7.3  Via RHSA-2010:0602 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0602.html>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=451615#c16)  Vincent Danen    2013-05-08 17:28:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2013

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2013

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 89 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapril2013verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2013 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1548709.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1548709.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, customers are recommended to upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

# USN-731-1: Apache vulnerabilities

10 March 2009

Apache vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [apache2](/security/cves?package=apache2) -

## Details

It was discovered that Apache did not sanitize the method specifier header from

an HTTP request when it is returned in an error message, which could result in

browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the

output. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into

viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as

passwords), within the same domain. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and

7.10. ([CVE-2007-6203](/security/CVE-2007-6203))

It was discovered that Apache was vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery

(CSRF) in the mod\_proxy\_balancer balancer manager. If an Apache administrator

were tricked into clicking a link on a specially crafted web page, an attacker

could trigger commands that could modify the balancer manager configuration.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2007-6420](/security/CVE-2007-6420))

It was discovered that Apache had a memory leak when using mod\_ssl with

compression. A remote attacker could exploit this to exhaust server memory,

leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 7.10.

([CVE-2008-1678](/security/CVE-2008-1678))

It was discovered that in certain conditions, Apache did not specify a default

character set when returning certain error messages containing UTF-7 encoded

data, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting

attacks when processing the output. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and

7.10. ([CVE-2008-2168](/security/CVE-2008-2168))

It was discovered that when configured as a proxy server, Apache did not limit

the number of forwarded interim responses. A malicious remote server could send

a large number of interim responses and cause a denial of service via memory

exhaustion. ([CVE-2008-2364](/security/CVE-2008-2364))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ftp did not sanitize wildcard pathnames when

they are returned in directory listings, which could result in browsers becoming

vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output.

([CVE-2008-2939](/security/CVE-2008-2939))

  Impact: Systems that have been manually configured to use rlogin and host.equiv may unexpectedly permit root login

  Description: The manpage for the configuration file hosts.equiv indicates that entries do not apply to root. However, an implementation issue in rlogind causes these entries to also apply to root. This update addresses the issue by properly disallowing rlogin from the root user if the remote system is in hosts.equiv. The rlogin service is not enabled by default in Mac OS X, and must be manually configured in order to be enabled. Credit to Ralf Meyer for reporting this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0967)

## Topic

Updated httpd packages that resolve several security issues and fix a bug
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web server.

A flaw was found in the mod\_proxy Apache module. An attacker in control of
a Web server to which requests were being proxied could have caused a
limited denial of service due to CPU consumption and stack exhaustion.
(CVE-2008-2364)

A flaw was found in the mod\_proxy\_ftp Apache module. If Apache was
configured to support FTP-over-HTTP proxying, a remote attacker could have
performed a cross-site scripting attack. (CVE-2008-2939)

In addition, these updated packages fix a bug found in the handling of the
"ProxyRemoteMatch" directive in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 httpd
packages. This bug is not present in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 5 packages.

Users of httpd should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- curl
When HTTP-redirect following was enabled curl followed any URL, even
one to e.g. local files (CVE-2009-0037).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
- libmikmod
Specially crafted XM files or playing mod files with varying number
of channels could crash applications using libmikmod
(CVE-2009-0179, CVE-2007-6720).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
- apache2
A DoS condition in apache2's mod\_proxy has
been fixed (CVE-2008-2364).
Affected Products: SLES10
- optipng
Specially crafted BMP files could overflow a buffer in optipng
(CVE-2008-5101), specially crafted GIF files could crash optipng
(CVE-2009-0749).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- psi
Remote attackers could crash the Psi instant messaging client via
the file transfer port (CVE-2008-6393).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
OpenJDK Java 1.6.0 was upgraded to build b14, fixing quite a lot of security issues.
It fixes at least:
4486841 UTF8 decoder should adhere to corrigendum to Unicode 3.0.1

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Darke    2002-04-29 05:39:18 UTC  ``` In ebuild: kdbg-1.2.5.3.ebuild    The package won't install due to what appears to be a conflict with the ebuild version being  different to the package version (kdbg-1.2.5.tar.gz) being downloaded. A simple fix for this  appears to be the addition of the following line to kdbg-1.2.5.2.ebuild:    S=${WORKDIR}/kdbg-1.2.5    This was tested and worked on the latest rsync (approx. 2002/04/29 - 20:00+1000). It  appears that the kdbg-1.2.5.2.ebuild will have the same problem, but this is untested. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-30 06:54:56 UTC  ``` Fixed in cvs. This must have been a miscommit or something. Thanks for reporting.  ``` |  |
