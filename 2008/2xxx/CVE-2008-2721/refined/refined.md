The provided content contains information about security vulnerabilities fixed in Gallery 2.2.5, which is relevant to CVE-2008-2721.

**Vulnerabilities Addressed in Gallery 2.2.5:**

1.  **XSS through host and path component of request URL:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application was not properly sanitizing the complete request URL.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts into the request URL, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure when the URL is processed by a user's browser.
    *   **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted URL.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to create and distribute a crafted URL.

2.  **Information disclosure in album-select module:**
    *   **Root cause:** Exposure of album titles through the album-select module when a guest added a new album to a hidden album.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Information disclosure.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized users could potentially learn the titles of hidden albums.
    *   **Attack vector:** Exploiting the album-select module.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Basic interaction with the application as a guest user.

3.  **Permission escalation through zip archive extraction:**
    *   **Root cause:** Sub-albums were being created when adding items from a ZIP archive even if the active user didn't have sufficient permissions.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Permission escalation.
    *   **Impact:** Users could create sub-albums without proper authorization, potentially leading to unauthorized access or changes to the Gallery structure.
    *   **Attack vector:** Uploading a specially crafted ZIP archive.
    *  **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to upload files to the application.

4.  **Information disclosure through embed.php:**
    *   **Root cause:** `embed.php` was susceptible to spoofing the remote address, thus revealing the local filesystem path of the Gallery 2 installation folder.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Information disclosure.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could learn the local path of the Gallery 2 installation. This path information could assist in further attacks.
    *   **Attack vector:** Spoofing the remote address when accessing `embed.php`.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to manipulate the remote address during the request.

5.  **View permissions not enforced for password-protected items:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application was offering the option to protect non-album items directly instead of only offering protection for albums and the items within them. Full protection was not being applied to non-album items.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Inconsistent permissions enforcement.
    *   **Impact:** Non-album items could appear password-protected but would not fully enforce the protection, thus unauthorized users could view the protected items.
    *   **Attack vector:** Direct access to password protected non-album items.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Basic interaction with the application.
