Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2790

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation on the `id` parameter within the `detail.php` script of the easyTrade 2.x application. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of user-supplied input (`id` parameter) in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - **Information Disclosure:** Retrieval of sensitive information from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords, database structure, version information).
  - **Data Modification:** Manipulation or deletion of data within the database.
  - **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining elevated privileges within the database.
  - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Causing disruptions to the application by executing resource-intensive SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a manipulated `id` parameter in the `detail.php` script.
   - Example: `http://[target]/[path]/detail.php?id=[SQL Injection Payload]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** Basic understanding of SQL syntax is needed to craft effective injection payloads.
- **No Authentication Needed:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability since the `id` parameter is exposed via a GET request

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit PoC demonstrates how to use a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract database information: `detail.php?id=-1%20union%20select%20USER(),2,3,4,5,@@VERSION,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,database(),15,16`
- The exploit notes that the application does not throw SQL errors, so attackers must rely on observing content changes to identify successful injection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Exploit-DB entry indicates the vulnerability was discovered by "h0yt3r".
- The vulnerable application is identified as easyTrade v2.x.
- The vulnerability is in a PHP-based web application.
