Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2210:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in Maian Support v1.3. Specifically, the application fails to filter user-supplied input passed through the `msg_script`, `msg_script2`, and `msg_script3` parameters in the `footer.php` and `header.php` files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The application directly reflects the unsanitized input in the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary script execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable pages.
- **Session hijacking:** By executing malicious scripts, an attacker could steal the admin's session cookies. This is explicitly stated in the report "You Can Get Admin Session With This Vuln....".
- **Web page defacement:** An attacker could modify the content of vulnerable pages.
- **Redirection:** An attacker could redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET requests:** The attack vectors are the vulnerable parameters `msg_script`, `msg_script2`, and `msg_script3` via HTTP GET requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, requiring no special local access.
- **Medium Attack Complexity:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
- **No Authentication Required:** No user authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable parameters are `msg_script`, `msg_script2`, and `msg_script3`.
- Vulnerable files are `admin/inc/footer.php` and `admin/inc/header.php`.
- XSS payloads were demonstrated with `<script>alert('xss')</script>`.
- A suggested solution is to use the `htmlspecialchar()` function to sanitize the input.
