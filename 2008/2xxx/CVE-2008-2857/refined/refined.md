The provided content is related to CVE-2008-2857.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application suffers from an insecure MySQL query. Specifically, the vulnerability is caused by a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `que_id` and `id` parameters in `forum_answer.php` and `profile.php` respectively.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection Vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass authentication and view all user accounts and their plaintext passwords stored in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests to `forum_answer.php` and `profile.php` with crafted SQL injection payloads within the `que_id` and `id` parameters.
- Specifically the `que_id` parameter in `forum_answer.php` is vulnerable to a multi-row SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker. No prior authentication is needed.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Specific Exploitable URL Examples:**
- Multi-row: `http://site.com/forum_answer.php?que_id=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,3,4,concat(username,0x3a,password),6,7,8,9,10/**/FROM/**/expert/*`
- Normal: `http://site.com/profile.php?id=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,CONCAT(username,0x3a,password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25/**/FROM/**/expert/**/LIMIT/**/0,1/*`
