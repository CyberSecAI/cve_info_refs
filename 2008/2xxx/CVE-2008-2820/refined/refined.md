Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2820:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `lang-system.php` script of Open Azimyt CMS. The script uses a GET parameter 'lang' to set the language for the session. The value of this parameter is then directly used in the file path `$SystemLangFile` without sufficient sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the 'lang' parameter to include directory traversal sequences (`../`) and null byte injection (`%00`) to include arbitrary files from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI. By manipulating the 'lang' parameter, an attacker can include and execute arbitrary local files on the server.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize the 'lang' parameter, allowing directory traversal and null byte injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  If the attacker can include a file containing malicious PHP code, they can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Information Disclosure:** By including arbitrary files, the attacker could gain access to sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, or database credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out through a crafted HTTP GET request to `azimyt/lang/lang-system.php` with a malicious value for the 'lang' parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic Knowledge of Directory Traversal & URL Encoding:** The attacker needs to understand directory traversal (`../`) and null byte injection (`%00`) techniques to construct the malicious payload.
