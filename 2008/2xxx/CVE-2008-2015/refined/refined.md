Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in multiple insecure methods within the ActiveX control of Watchfire Appscan v7.0. Specifically, the methods `CompactSave`, `saveRecordedExploreToFile`, and `SaveSession` are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** The vulnerable ActiveX methods allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can overwrite critical system files like `autoexec.bat`, `boot.ini`, and `ntldr_`, potentially leading to system instability, denial of service, or complete compromise of the affected machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by embedding malicious code in a website or other document that can be opened by a user.
- **ActiveX Control:** The attack leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control installed with Watchfire Appscan v7.0.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to get a user to visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious document containing the exploit code.
- The user must have Watchfire Appscan v7.0 installed, with the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- The attacker does not appear to need any specific privileges to carry out the attack other than the ability to write the specific files.

**Technical Details:**
The provided HTML code snippets demonstrate how to call the vulnerable ActiveX methods using JavaScript, specifying a file path as a parameter. The methods are `ctrl.CompactSave()`, `ctrl.saveRecordedExploreToFile()`, and `ctrl.SaveSession()`. The `classid` attribute of the `<object>` tag specifies the vulnerable ActiveX control.
