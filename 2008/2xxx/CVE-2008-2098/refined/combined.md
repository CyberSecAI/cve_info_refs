# VMware Player, Server, Workstation: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation, allowing remote and local attackers to conduct several
attacks, including privilege escalation, remote execution of arbitrary
code, and a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-player** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-workstation** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **6.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-server** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0.9.156507** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

VMware Player, Server, and Workstation allow emulation of a complete PC
on a PC without the usual performance overhead of most emulators.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

Local users may be able to gain escalated privileges, cause a Denial of
Service, or gain sensitive information.

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code, or a Denial
of Service. Remote attackers also may be able to spoof DNS traffic, read
arbitrary files, or inject arbitrary web script to the VMware Server
Console.

Furthermore, guest OS users may be able to execute arbitrary code on the
host OS, gain escalated privileges on the guest OS, or cause a Denial of
Service (crash the host OS).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Player. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Player:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-player"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
“>=app-emulation/vmware-player-3.1.5”, however these packages are
not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Workstation. We recommend that
users unmerge VMware Workstation:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-workstation"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
“>=app-emulation/vmware-workstation-7.1.5”, however these packages
are not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Server. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Server:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-server"

```

##### VMware Security Advisory

#####

VMware Security AdvisoryAdvisory ID:  VMSA-2008-0008 VMware Security AdvisorySynopsis:  Updates to VMware Workstation, VMware Player, VMware ACE, VMware Fusion resolve critical security issues VMware Security AdvisoryIssue date:  2008-05-30 VMware Security AdvisoryUpdated on:  2008-05-30 (initial release of advisory) VMware Security AdvisoryCVE numbers:  CVE-2008-2098 CVE-2008-2099
##### 1. Summary:

Several critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed in the newest releases of VMware's hosted product line.

#####

##### 2. Relevant releases:

VMware Workstation 6.0.3 and earlier,
VMware Player 2.0.3 and earlier,
VMware ACE 2.0.3 and earlier,
VMware Fusion 1.1.1 and earlier

NOTES: Users of VMware hosted products VMware Workstation 5.x, VMware Player 1.x, and VMware ACE 1.x should note that although they are not vulnerable to these issue, they will reach their end of general support on 2008-11-09. Customers should plan to upgrade to the latest version of their respective products.

##### 3. Problem description:

a. VMware HGFS File System Heap Overflow
The VMware Host Guest File System (HGFS) shared folders feature allows users to transfer data between a guest operating system and the non-virtualized host operating system that contains it.

A heap buffer overflow condition is present in VMware HGFS. Exploitation of this flaw might allow an unprivileged guest process to execute code in the context of the vmx process on the host.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, the VMware system must have at least one folder shared. Two things must happen for a folder to be shared. 1) Shared folders must be enabled, and 2) a folder must be selected from the host system to be shared. No folders are shared by default in any version of our products, which means this vulnerability is not exploitable by default. Workstation 6.x, Player 2.x, and ACE 2.x have shared folders disabled by default.

VMware Server, ESX and ESXi do not provide the shared folders feature. Because there is no back-end for the HGFS protocol on the virtualization host, these products are architecturally immune to this issue.

This issue might not be exploitable on host operating systems which have implemented heap protection.

VMware would like to thank Andrew Honig of the Department of Defense for reporting this issue.

The Common Vulnerabilities and exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-2098 to this issue.

#####

b. Windows based VMCI arbitrary code execution vulnerability
VMCI was introduced in VMware Workstation 6.0, VMware Player 2.0, and VMware ACE 2.0. It is an experimental, optional feature that allows virtual machines to communicate with one another.

With VMCI enabled a guest may execute arbitrary code in the context of the vmx process on the host. This is a compiler dependent vulnerability and only affects systems running on windows hosts.

VMware would like to thank Andrew Honig of the Department of Defense for reporting this issue.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-2099 to this issues.
