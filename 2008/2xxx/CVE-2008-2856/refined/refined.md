Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$id`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically the vulnerable line is:  `$vysledek=mysql_query("select * from clanky where id= '" . $id . "'")`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization/validation, direct use of user input in SQL query.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially allowing them to read sensitive data (including the content of other tables via `UNION SELECT`), modify database records, or potentially execute system commands if the database user has sufficient privileges (via functions like `load_file()`).  The provided exploit uses `load_file()` to attempt reading source code.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `clanek.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server and knowledge of SQL syntax. The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable page and the server's `magic_quotes` must be turned off.

**Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application echoes user-supplied input (`$zaznam["nadpis"]`) within the HTML output without proper encoding, making it susceptible to XSS. Specifically, the vulnerable line is `<h1><a href="clanek.php?id=<?echo $id?>"><?echo $zaznam["nadpis"]?></a></h1>`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of output encoding, improper handling of user input when rendering HTML content.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which will be executed in the browsers of other users who visit the page. This can allow them to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, and perform other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `clanek.php` with a malicious XSS payload in the  `nadpis`  field in the database.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server and the ability to modify the database in order to control the value of `nadpis`. The attacker can likely use the SQL injection vulnerability to modify the `nadpis` field.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, including specific vulnerable code lines and proof-of-concept exploit examples.
*   The SQL injection exploit utilizes `UNION SELECT` and the `load_file` function, indicating the attacker has some knowledge of the MySQL database being used.
*   The document specifies that "magic\_quote must turn off" for the SQL injection to be successful, indicating this was a protection mechanism that was circumvented.
*   The XSS vulnerability is in the outputting of the nadpis, which must first be injected into the database likely through the SQLi.
* The provided source code for the exploit uses `char()` function to obfuscate the path to the file.
