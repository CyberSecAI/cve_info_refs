```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'renderer' parameter of the 'template.tpl.php' file, allowing for directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Local File Inclusion (LFI).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local or remote files, potentially leading to code execution, information disclosure, or other malicious activities. An attacker can read local files by using a directory traversal technique, or execute remote files by including external URLs.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP requests by manipulating the 'renderer' parameter of the 'template.tpl.php' file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
