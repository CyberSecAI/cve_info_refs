The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting several Xigla products. Specifically, CVE-2008-2764 is associated with vulnerabilities in "Absolute Form Processor XE".

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "orderby" parameter in the `search.asp` script.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of sanitization of user-provided input in various fields within `search.asp` and `users.asp` scripts.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the `orderby` parameter of the `search.asp` page.
*   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into vulnerable fields of  `search.asp` and `users.asp` pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to potentially read, modify, or delete database data. In some cases, this can lead to full server compromise.
*   **XSS:**  Allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  By crafting malicious URLs with SQL code in the `orderby` parameter of the affected ASP pages.
    *   `http://[URL]/absolutefp/search.asp?orderby=[SQL INJECTION]`

*   **XSS:** By crafting malicious URLs or injecting malicious data through the vulnerable fields of the affected ASP pages.
    *   `http://[URL]/absolutefp/admin/search.asp`
    *   `http://[URL]/absolutefp/admin/users.asp`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web server.
*   For SQL injection, no authentication is needed.
*   For XSS, an admin account or access to the admin pages of the application is required.
