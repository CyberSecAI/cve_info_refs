Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Arbitrary File Upload

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `imgupload.php` script within the FlashBlog application, specifically the `admin/Editor/` directory. The script allows users to upload files without proper sanitization or verification, leading to arbitrary file upload.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `imgupload.php` script does not adequately validate the type or content of uploaded files.
*   **Missing File Type Restrictions:** The application fails to restrict the file types that can be uploaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can upload malicious PHP files (e.g., c99 shell) to the server, allowing them to execute arbitrary code, gain complete control of the web server, steal sensitive data, and potentially use the compromised server to launch further attacks.
*   **Web Site Defacement:** The attacker can upload malicious files that alter the visual appearance of the web site.
*   **Data Theft:** Once the attacker has gained control of the web server, they can steal sensitive data, such as passwords, database credentials, personal information, or financial data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted upload request to the vulnerable script.
*   **Web Interface:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability through the web interface provided by the FlashBlog application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable FlashBlog application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `imgupload.php` script (`/admin/Editor/imgupload.php`).
*   **No authentication required:** This exploit does not require user authentication.

**Technical Details:**
*   The exploit involves uploading a file (e.g., `c99.php`) through the `imgupload.php` script.
*   The uploaded file is then accessible through a predictable path (e.g., `/tus_imagenes/c99.php`).
*   The vulnerability exists in FlashBlog version beta0.31.
*   The application is written in PHP.

This information is more detailed than what would typically be found in a standard CVE description, providing specifics on the vulnerable script, the nature of the uploaded files, and the potential impact of the exploit.
