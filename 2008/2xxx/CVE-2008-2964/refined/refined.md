{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly uses user-supplied input in a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to lack of proper input sanitization when constructing SQL query.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'id' parameter in the URL, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application."
