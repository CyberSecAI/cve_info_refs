|  |  | | **Deciphering the PHP-Nuke Capthca** **2008.04.30** Credit:  **[Michael Brooks](https://cxsecurity.com/author/Michael%2BBrooks/1/)**  Risk: **Low** Local: **No** Remote: ****Yes**** CVE: **[CVE-2008-2020](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2008-2020/ "Click to see CVE-2008-2020")** CWE: **[CWE-264](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-264 "CWE-264")**  CVSS Base Score: **6.8/10** Impact Subscore: **6.4/10** Exploitability Subscore: **8.6/10** Exploit range: **Remote** Attack complexity: **Medium** Authentication: **No required** Confidentiality impact: **Partial** Integrity impact: **Partial** Availability impact: **Partial** | | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The Capthca used in the current version 8.1 of PHP Nuke can be deciphered with 100% accuracy. more information can be found her:
http://www.rooksecurity.com/blog/?p=6
Exploit Code: http://www.rooksecurity.com/exploits/php\_nuke\_captcha.zip
What is so interesting about this captcha is that it is incredibly wide spread. Variants of this captcha are being used by big names like Paypal. This particular captcha is used for the forgotten password feature. There are few differences between this captcha and the one i broke. For one the background is a different image. The captcha is also using alpha-numeric which would mean 36^5 = 60466176 possibilities
My attack against PHP-Nuke is taking advantage of the fact that there are only 10^6 or a 1,000,000 possible combinations of this captcha. It only takes a few minuets to calculate all possibilities. I am storing the results in as a md5 hash in a SQL database for speed. The entire SQL table needed to crack this captcha with 100% accuracy takes up less than 43 megabytes. After the table is generated it take only a few seconds to crack a captcha. This is a time-memory trade off very similar to Rainbow Crack. Let me be very clear that I am not relying on MD5 for security and in fact a faster and much less secure message digest function like Tiger is better suited for this task. MD5 is being used as an attack tool because it saves a lot of space and time verses storing the entire image in the database.
I created this list manually making sure that I checked the latest version. This is by no means a complete list.

## Learn How MDR Can Help Your Organization

[Managed detection and response (MDR)](/en-us/products/managed-detection-and-response "Sophos Managed Detection and Response (MDR)") is a fully-managed, 24/7 service delivered by experts who specialize in detecting and responding to cyberattacks that technology solutions alone cannot prevent. By combining human expertise with protection technologies and advanced machine learning models, MDR analysts can detect, investigate, and neutralize advanced human-led attacks, preventing data breaches and ransomware.

The reality is that technology cannot stop every attack. Today’s well-funded adversaries abuse stolen credentials, security misconfigurations, and legitimate IT tools to bypass defense technologies, and they continually innovate and industrialize their approaches. The only way to reliably detect and neutralize determined attackers is with 24×7 eyes-on-glass delivered by security operations professionals. Providing this round-the-clock expert coverage is unrealistic for most organizations on their own and, as a result, companies are increasingly turning to specialist Managed Detection Response (MDR) providers for support.

## What is Managed Detection and Response (MDR)?

MDR is a fully-managed, 24/7 service delivered by cybersecurity experts who specialize in detecting and responding to cyberattacks. By combining human expertise with protection technologies and advanced machine learning models, MDR security analysts can detect, investigate, and neutralize advanced human-led attacks, preventing data breaches and ransomware.

[### Why MDR?

MDR services provide the expertise for you, enabling organizations to expand their security operations capabilities without expanding their headcount.](#card-micro-colorbox-275801)
## What are the Benefits of MDR?

With MDR you benefit from the breadth and depth of experience of the provider’s analysts capabilities. Threat detection and response is time consuming and unpredictable. The urgent nature of the work can prevent teams from focusing on more strategic — and often more interesting — challenges. Working with an MDR service enables you to free up IT capacity to support business-focused initiatives. MDR services provide the expertise for you, enabling organizations to expand their security operations capabilities without expanding their headcount.

[### MDR Benefits

One of the major advantages of using an MDR provider over in-house only security operations programs is elevated protection against ransomware and other advanced cyber threats.](#card-micro-colorbox-304416)
## What are the Benefits of MDR

With MDR you benefit from the breadth and depth of experience of the provider’s analysts. A MDR vendor will experience a far greater volume and variety of attacks than any individual organization, giving them a level of expertise that is almost impossible to replicate in house. Threat detection and response is time consuming and unpredictable. The urgent nature of the work can prevent teams from focusing on more strategic — and often more interesting — challenges. Working with a MDR service enables you to free up IT capacity to support business-focused initiatives. Adversaries are most active at the times when your IT team is least likely to be online, such as evenings, weekends, and holiday periods. By providing 24/7 coverage, MDR services provide considerable reassurance and peace of mind. Threat detection and response is a highly complex operation. MDR services provide the expertise for you, enabling organizations to expand their security operations capabilities without expanding their headcount. Maintaining a 24/7 threat hunting team is expensive. By leveraging economies of scale, MDR services provide a cost-effective way to secure your organization and stretch your cybersecurity budget further.

[### Security Telemetry

Security telemetry is gathered from across the full IT ecosystem: endpoint, firewall, network, cloud, email, and identity solutions to provide a complete view of your security posture.](#card-micro-colorbox-275811)
## What is Security Telemetry?

The more analysts can see, the faster they can respond. Threat intelligence and business context are added to the data to provide a more complete view. Related security events are grouped into clusters for complete and efficient investigation. Highly-trained analysts proactively detect threats that bypass security products. They look for tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly used by cybercriminals and threats that may bypass various security tools. Analysts determine the scope and severity of the threat and identify next steps. Analysts interrupt the attack to prevent it from spreading, while removing the malware and isolating the impacted systems. Analysts perform root cause analysis to fully eliminate the attacker and prevent recurrence.

[### MDR Service Providers

An MDR service provider offers a technology stack covering your endpoints, networks, cloud environments, and other areas of your IT infrastructure. MDR providers detect and remediate cyberthreats 24/7/365 while providing threat intelligence services.](#card-micro-colorbox-304411)
## What Does a MDR Provider Offer?

* 24/7/365 monitoring to help you identify cyberthreats across your IT infrastructure.
* Support from threat hunters, security analysts, and other cybersecurity professionals that can teach you about cyberthreats and help you identify and respond to them.
* Threat investigations that you can use to learn about cyberthreats and cybercriminals' TTPs and find out why and how cyberattacks are happening.
* Threat intelligence that you can use to understand cyberthreats and what can be done to stop them.
* Security reports that you can use to comply with HIPAA, GDPR, and other data security regulations.

[### MDR, EDR, and XDR

MDR is a managed service that blends EDR (endpoint detection and response) and XDR (extended detection and response) capabilities. The service is managed by an MDR provider that detects and remediates cyberthreats.](#card-micro-colorbox-312751)
## MDR vs. EDR vs. XDR: What You Need to Know

MDR is a managed service that blends [EDR](/en-us/products/endpoint-antivirus/edr "EDR security") and XDR capabilities. The service is managed by an MDR provider that looks for cyberthreats across your IT infrastructure. If a threat is found, your MDR provider responds to the threat for you or notifies you about it. In either scenario, your MDR provider keeps you in the loop about cyberthreats and what you can to guard against them.

An EDR service classifies known threats as it identifies them. The service looks for unusual or suspicious activity across your endpoints. It also uses a database that contains threat insights to compare this activity against cyberthreats. If your EDR service identifies a threat, it automatically responds to it for you.

XDR goes beyond EDR, since it looks for threats across your IT infrastructure. An XDR service tracks things like abnormal network traffic and anomalous cloud activity that indicate a cyberattack may be underway. It provides [threat intelligence](https://assets.sophos.com/X24WTUEQ/at/vhfnqbtsg5kxcxhq6kcvt6h/sophos-threat-intelligence-ds.pdf) to help you understand security issues across your IT infrastructure. You can use this threat intelligence to find ways to keep pace with current and emerging cyberthreats and level up your security posture.
