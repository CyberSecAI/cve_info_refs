* [linux-source-2.6.15](/security/cves?package=linux-source-2.6.15) -
* [linux-source-2.6.22](/security/cves?package=linux-source-2.6.22) -

## Details

It was discovered that the direct-IO subsystem did not correctly validate

certain structures. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a system

crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-6716](/security/CVE-2007-6716))

It was discovered that the disabling of the ZERO\_PAGE optimization could

lead to large memory consumption. A local attacker could exploit this to

allocate all available memory, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2008-2372](/security/CVE-2008-2372))

It was discovered that the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) did

not correctly validate its arguments. If DCCP was in use, a remote attacker

could send specially crafted network traffic and cause a system crash,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3276](/security/CVE-2008-3276))

It was discovered that the SBNI WAN driver did not correctly check for the

NET\_ADMIN capability. A malicious local root user lacking CAP\_NET\_ADMIN

would be able to change the WAN device configuration, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2008-3525](/security/CVE-2008-3525))

It was discovered that the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) did

not correctly validate the key length in the SCTP\_AUTH\_KEY option. If SCTP

is in use, a remote attacker could send specially crafted network traffic

that would crash the system, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2008-3526](/security/CVE-2008-3526))

It was discovered that the tmpfs implementation did not correctly handle

certain sequences of inode operations. A local attacker could exploit this

to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3534](/security/CVE-2008-3534))

It was discovered that the readv/writev functions did not correctly handle

certain sequences of file operations. A local attacker could exploit this

to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3535](/security/CVE-2008-3535))

It was discovered that SCTP did not correctly validate its userspace

arguments. A local attacker could call certain sctp\_\* functions with

malicious options and cause a system crash, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2008-3792](/security/CVE-2008-3792), [CVE-2008-4113](/security/CVE-2008-4113), [CVE-2008-4445](/security/CVE-2008-4445))

It was discovered the the i915 video driver did not correctly validate

memory addresses. A local attacker could exploit this to remap memory

that could cause a system crash, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2008-3831](/security/CVE-2008-3831))

Johann Dahm and David Richter discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly

handle certain file ACLs. If NFSv4 is in use, a local attacker could create

a malicious ACL that could cause a system crash, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2008-3915](/security/CVE-2008-3915))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: For systems without the hardy-updates pocket enabled, the 8.04

kernel update will include an unavoidable ABI change. The kernel update

has been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-386,

linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a standard system upgrade will

automatically perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Linux kernel on SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 Service Pack 2 and fixes
the following security problems:
The version of the kernel is 2.6.16.60-0.25.
CVE-2008-1615: On x86\_64 a denial of service attack could be used by local
attackers to immediately panic / crash the machine.
CVE-2008-1669: Fixed a SMP ordering problem in fcntl\_setlk could potentially
allow local attackers to execute code by timing file locking.
CVE-2008-2372: Fixed a resource starvation problem in the handling of ZERO
mmap pages.
CVE-2008-1673: The asn1 implementation in (a) the Linux kernel, as used
in the cifs and ip\_nat\_snmp\_basic modules does not properly validate
length values during decoding of ASN.1 BER data, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code
via (1) a length greater than the working buffer, which can lead to an
unspecified overflow; (2) an oid length of zero, which can lead to an
off-by-one error; or (3) an indefinite length for a primitive encoding.
CVE-2008-2812: Various tty / serial devices did not check functionpointers
for NULL before calling them, leading to potential crashes or code execution.
The devices affected are usually only accessible by the root user though.
CVE-2008-2931: A missing permission check in mount changing was added
which could have been used by local attackers to change the mountdirectory.
Additionaly a very large number of bugs was fixed. Details can be found
in the RPM changelog of the included packages.
OCFS2 has been upgraded to the 1.4.1 release:
- Endian fixes
- Use slab caches for DLM objects
- Export DLM state info to debugfs
- Avoid ENOSPC in rare conditions when free inodes are reserved by
other nodes
- Error handling fix in ocfs2\_start\_walk\_page\_trans()
- Cleanup lockres printing
- Allow merging of extents
- Fix to allow changing permissions of symlinks
- Merged local fixes upstream (no code change)
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the updated kernel.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The openSUSE 11.0 kernel was updated to 2.6.25.11-0.1.
It fixes following security problems:
CVE-2008-2812: Various tty / serial devices did not check
function pointers for NULL before calling them, leading to potential
crashes or code execution. The devices affected are usually only
accessible by the root user though.
CVE-2008-2750: The pppol2tp\_recvmsg function in drivers/net/pppol2tp.c
in the Linux kernel allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (kernel heap memory corruption and system crash) and possibly
have unspecified other impact via a crafted PPPOL2TP packet that
results in a large value for a certain length variable.
CVE-2008-3247: On x86\_64 systems, a incorrect buffer size in LDT
handling might lead to local untrusted attackers causing a crash
of the machine or potentially execute code with kernel privileges.
This problem only affects the openSUSE 11.0 kernel, since the problem
was introduced in the 2.6.25 kernel.
The update also has lots of other bugfixes that are listed in the
RPM changelog.
We previously also released a 2.6.25.9-0.2 kernel but did not
separately announce it. That update fixed the following security
problems:
CVE-2008-2372: A resource starvation issue within mmap was fixed,
which could have been used by local attackers to hang the machine.
CVE-2008-2826: A integer overflow in SCTP was fixed, which might have
been used by remote attackers to crash the machine or potentially
execute code.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This is a respin of the previous Linux kernel update for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP2
as announced in SUSE-SA:2008:035, which got retracted due to an IDE-CDROM regression,
where any IDE CDROM access would hang or crash the system. Only this problem was fixed additionally.
The kernel version in this update is 2.6.16.60-0.27.
This kernel update fixes the following security problems:
CVE-2008-1615: On x86\_64 a denial of service attack could be used by local
attackers to immediately panic / crash the machine.
CVE-2008-1669: Fixed a SMP ordering problem in fcntl\_setlk could potentially
allow local attackers to execute code by timing file locking.
CVE-2008-2372: Fixed a resource starvation problem in the handling of ZERO
mmap pages.
CVE-2008-1673: The ASN1 implementation in (a) the Linux kernel, as used
in the cifs and ip\_nat\_snmp\_basic modules does not properly validate
length values during decoding of ASN.1 BER data, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code
via (1) a length greater than the working buffer, which can lead to an
unspecified overflow; (2) an oid length of zero, which can lead to an
off-by-one error; or (3) an indefinite length for a primitive encoding.
CVE-2008-2812: Various tty / serial devices did not check function pointers
for NULL before calling them, leading to potential crashes or code execution.
The devices affected are usually only accessible by the root user though.
CVE-2008-2931: A missing permission check in mount changing was added
which could have been used by local attackers to change the mount directory.
Additionally a very large number of bugs was fixed. Details can be found
in the RPM changelog of the included packages.
OCFS2 has been upgraded to the 1.4.1 release:
- Endian fixes
- Use slab caches for DLM objects
- Export DLM state info to debugfs
- Avoid ENOSPC in rare conditions when free inodes are reserved by
other nodes
- Error handling fix in ocfs2\_start\_walk\_page\_trans()
- Cleanup lockres printing
- Allow merging of extents
- Fix to allow changing permissions of symlinks
- Merged local fixes upstream (no code change)
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the updated kernel.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
