{
  "CVE-2008-2101": {
    "Description": "VMware Consolidated Backup (VCB) command-line utilities accept the user password through the -p command-line option. Users logged into the ESX service console or into the system that runs VCB could gain access to the username and password used by VCB command-line utilities when such commands are running. The ESX patch and the new version of VCB resolve this issue by providing an alternative way of passing the password used by VCB command-line utilities.",
    "Root cause": "The VCB command-line utilities were accepting the user password directly through the -p command-line option.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of sensitive information"
    ],
    "Impact": "Users logged into the ESX service console or the system running VCB could gain access to the username and password used by VCB command-line utilities.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the ESX service console or the system running VCB.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to have access to the ESX service console or the system where VCB is running."
