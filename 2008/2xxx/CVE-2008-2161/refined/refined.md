{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The TFTP server is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing a long TFTP error packet. Specifically, the server copies the error message from the received packet into a buffer located in the .bss section without proper bounds checking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking.",
       "The server does not adhere to the defined maximum length for error messages in TFTP RFC 1350, which is a vulnerability."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. By sending a crafted TFTP error message, an attacker can overwrite portions of the .bss and .idata sections, including function addresses in the Import Address Table (IAT), allowing the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted TFTP error packet to the vulnerable TFTP server via UDP on port 69.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send UDP packets to the target server on port 69. No prior authentication is required."
  },
  "exploit_details": {
     "technique": "The exploit sends a TFTP error packet with an oversized error message, which consists of NOPs, shellcode, and a return address. The oversized message overwrites a buffer in the .bss section, and further overflows into the .idata section, patching the address of either `time()` (for the service) or `printf()` (for the standalone program) to point to the attacker-controlled shellcode. When the patched function is called, the shellcode executes.",
    "shellcode": "The provided shellcode is designed to open a bind shell on port 4444.",
    "target_versions": "TFTP Server for Windows version 1.4, however other versions might also be vulnerable"
