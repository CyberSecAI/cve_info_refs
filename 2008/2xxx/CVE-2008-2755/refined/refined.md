Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2755

**Vulnerability:** Blind SQL Injection

**Affected Software:** JAMM CMS

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists in the `index.php` script of JAMM CMS. The `id` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper input validation: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (specifically the `id` parameter) before using it in a SQL query.
- Blind SQL Injection: The application does not directly reveal the results of the SQL query, requiring attackers to infer information based on the application's behavior and response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Data Access: Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
- Full Database Compromise: In some circumstances, attackers can gain complete control of the database, modify data, or even delete tables.
- Application compromise: Attackers can gain access to the database to modify application configurations or even inject malicious code to compromise the application itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `index.php` script, injecting malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the target server hosting the vulnerable JAMM CMS application.
- Knowledge of SQL: Attackers must have a knowledge of SQL syntax in order to craft the malicious SQL statements.
- Ability to send web requests: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication needed: The exploit can be done without prior authentication since the vulnerability is in the `id` parameter in the request.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Perl exploit leverages the blind SQL injection vulnerability. It determines the length of the data to be extracted and then bruteforces the characters by sending different SQL queries based on comparing the page content after injecting specific SQL queries to determine if the condition is true, it does this character by character.
- The exploit also shows that a SQL error appears when providing a bad id value.
- The exploit is specifically designed for MySQL versions greater or equal than 5 (can use subqueries), older versions would require a `BENCHMARK()` approach.
- The example exploit uses `jamm_cms_owen_website_user` table which is likely not always the case, this part needs to be modified depending on the target.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Exploit-DB entry provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) and a Perl exploit, which aids in understanding how to exploit the vulnerability.
- It also mentions that the table name might vary in different deployments which would need to be changed for the exploit to work.
