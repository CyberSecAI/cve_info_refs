Debian Security Advisory DSA-1633-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Florian Weimer
September 01, 2008                    <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : slash
Vulnerability  : SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-2231, CVE-2008-2553
Debian Bug     : 484499

It has been discovered that Slash, the Slashdot Like Automated
Storytelling Homepage suffers from two vulnerabilities related to
insufficient input sanitation, leading to execution of SQL commands
(CVE-2008-2231) and cross-site scripting (CVE-2008-2553).

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.6-8etch1.

In the unstable distribution (sid), the slash package is currently
uninstallable and will be removed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your slash package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
