Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2353:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a local file inclusion (LFI) flaw in the `admin.php` file of GNU/Gallery. The script directly includes a file based on user-supplied input from the `$_GET['show']` parameter without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application includes files based on user input, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's file system.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not sanitize or validate the `$_GET['show']` parameter before using it in an `include()` statement.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd` or other configuration files containing sensitive information.
- **Potential for further attacks:** By reading application code or configuration files, an attacker can gain additional insight into the system, which could be used to launch further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `admin.php` file, by manipulating the `show` parameter.
- **URL manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `show` parameter of the URL to include directory traversal sequences such as `../../` to access files outside the intended directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
- **Basic understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft an HTTP GET request to exploit the LFI vulnerability.
- **No authentication required:** This vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.

**Detailed Description:**

The vulnerable code snippet from the `admin.php` file is:
```php
<?php
if($_GET['show']=="") {
  include("admin/index.php");
} else {
  include("admin/".$_GET['show']);
}
?>
```
This code checks if the `show` parameter is empty. If it is, it includes `admin/index.php`. Otherwise, it includes a file located in the "admin/" directory based on the user-provided value of the `show` parameter.

By manipulating the `show` parameter with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../etc/passwd`), an attacker can force the script to include arbitrary files from the server's file system, leading to information disclosure.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to read any file the web server user has read access to, potentially revealing sensitive data such as passwords, configurations, or source code.
