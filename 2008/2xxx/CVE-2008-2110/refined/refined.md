Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2110

**Vulnerable Software:** QTOFileManager V 1.0, based on Sava's Simple Upload Version: Final.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation in the file upload functionality, which allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including executable ones.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not properly validate the type or extension of uploaded files.
*   **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation):** This is specifically cited in the provided information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote File Upload:** Attackers can upload malicious files to the server.
*   **Partial Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The provided CVSS score and impact subscores indicate that a successful exploit could lead to partial compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The impact is not severe as only a partial compromise was specified.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Network:** The attack is performed remotely, targeting the file upload functionality of the vulnerable application.
*   **HTTP Request:** By crafting a specific HTTP request, the attacker can upload a file containing malicious code. The example `http://www.example.com/qtofm.php?[shell.php.jpg]` suggests the application is vulnerable to an arbitrary filename injection by appending the filename to the qtofm.php URL

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any form of authentication, making it easily accessible to anyone on the network.
*   **Basic Web knowledge:** An attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests or use a tool to upload a file to the web server.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was discovered by "Cr4zY CrAcKeR".
*   The application download link is given.
*   A sample search string (`inurl:qtofm.php`) is provided, which can be used to identify potentially vulnerable installations.
*   The exploit example suggests that by appending the filename to qtofm.php, an attacker can control the name of the uploaded file, and by using shell.php.jpg, can bypass file type checks by exploiting a filename injection vulnerability.
*   CVSS base score is 7.5/10.
*   The attack complexity is low, and the exploitability subscore is 10/10.
