- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in phpDMCA 1.0.0. The application includes files via a GET request using the `ourlinux_root_path` parameter. This allows an attacker to include a malicious file from a remote server, leading to system access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to system access.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is via a GET request. The vulnerable parameter is `ourlinux_root_path` in the `adodb-errorpear.inc.php` and `adodb-pear.inc.php` files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send a crafted GET request to the vulnerable server. They also need to have access to a malicious file on a remote server.
