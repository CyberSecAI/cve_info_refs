  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The `boxpop.php` script in ItCMS 1.9 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `shout` parameter, before writing it to a file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Rewriting",
        "Improper Input Sanitization",
        "Code Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious code into the `shouts.php` file. This can lead to remote code execution when `shouts.php` is accessed with an included file via the injected code, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request with the `shout` parameter",
        "HTTP GET request with the `shout` parameter"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST or GET requests to the `boxpop.php` file. The attacker also needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the method to execute the injected code, specifically referencing the `shouts.php` file with an additional parameter."
