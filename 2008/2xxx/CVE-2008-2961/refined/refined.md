```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'path' parameter of the view/index.php script, allowing for directory traversal.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files, source code, and system files, leading to information disclosure.
- Attack vectors: HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable view/index.php script with a malicious 'path' parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
