Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the Pooya Site Builder (PSB) software. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied parameters in the `/utils/getXsl.aspx`, `/utils/getXml.aspx`, and `/utils/getXls.aspx` files before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks in three different files:
    *   `/utils/getXsl.aspx` via the `xslIdn` parameter.
    *   `/utils/getXml.aspx` via the `part` parameter.
    *   `/utils/getXls.aspx` via the `part` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **High Impact:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to:
    *   Retrieve sensitive data from the database (e.g., usernames and passwords).
    *   Potentially modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Gain control over the database server (depending on database permissions and configurations).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vectors are through crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable files.
    *   The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `xslIdn` or `part` parameters within the URLs.
    *   The vulnerable application then executes the malicious SQL query against the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious queries.
*   **No Authentication:** The provided exploits do not require authentication to exploit.
*   **Internet Explorer (IE):** The advisory recommends using IE, although this might be due to specific encoding or parsing quirks.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploits use the `'` character to bypass potential SQL injection filters.
*   The provided exploit examples show how to retrieve usernames and passwords (`UsrNam` and `UsrPwd`) from the `[Usr]` table.
*   The recommended solution is to remove the vulnerable files or to wait for a vendor patch.
*   The vendor is identified as www.paridel.com.
*   The vulnerability affects version 6.0 (Assembly Version) of the Pooya Site Builder (PSB).
*   The provided exploits are functional and demonstrate the impact of the vulnerabilities.
