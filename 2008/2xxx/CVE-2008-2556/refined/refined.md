```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `datespan` parameter in the `read.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or complete database takeover. In this case, the exploit is used to retrieve database information.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `read.php` file, specifically by manipulating the `datespan` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server hosting the PHP Visit Counter application.
