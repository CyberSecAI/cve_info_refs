```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `site_path` parameter of `bbs.lib.inc.php` and in various other fields, allowing for Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server via RFI.  Also, XSS can be used to inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": {
    "RFI": "By manipulating the `site_path` parameter in the URL when accessing `bbs.lib.inc.php`.",
    "XSS": "By injecting malicious code into various input fields, such as the search field in `rg_search.php`."
  },
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. They need knowledge of the application's vulnerabilities."
