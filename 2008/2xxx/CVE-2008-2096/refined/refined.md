Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `cat_id` parameter of the BackLinkSpider application. Input provided to this parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection due to the lack of input validation/sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `cat_id` parameter.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input before incorporating it into SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **System Access:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to the system.
- **Data Exposure:** The attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Exploitation:** The attack can be carried out remotely through a web browser by manipulating the URL.
- **HTTP GET Request:** The `cat_id` parameter is passed through a GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- **Knowledge of SQL Syntax:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL syntax to craft the malicious injection code.
- **"magic_quotes" Enabled:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that the "magic_quotes" feature is enabled on the target server

**Technical Details:**

- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `cat_id` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Exploit Example:**
  - `http://www.target.com/[backlinkspider_page_name].php?cat_id=[SQL]`
  - `http://www.target.com/[backlinkspider_page_name].php?cat_id=-1%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,version(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0/*`
- **Dork:** `Google : "Powered By BackLinkSpider" "inurl:backlinkspider.php"`
- **Affected Software:** BackLinkSpider, version unknown
- **Vendor:** `http://www.backlinkspider.com/`

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is categorized as medium risk with a CVSS base score of 6.8.
- The exploitability subscore is 8.6, while the impact subscore is 6.4.
- The suggested solutions are to edit the source code to properly verify input and to enable `magic_quotes` in php.ini.
