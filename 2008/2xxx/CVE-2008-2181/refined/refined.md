Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-2181:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** Cplinks v1.03
*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to bypass the login authentication.
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `search.php` file leads to SQL injection.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application's `search.php` is vulnerable to XSS due to a lack of input sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Improper input sanitization and lack of parameterized queries makes the application vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **XSS:** Lack of input sanitization and output encoding allows for the injection of malicious scripts into web pages.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Insufficient input sanitization allows attackers to bypass authentication.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can gain unauthorized administrative access to the application.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive information from the database. In this specific case, the SQL injection vulnerability can be leveraged to obtain admin credentials.
    *  **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** By entering `' or 1=1 /*` in the username field and any value in the password field of the admin login page.
    *   **SQL Injection:** By injecting a malicious SQL query in the `search_text` parameter in `search.php`.
    *   **XSS:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `search_text` parameter in `search.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application (accessible via network or local access).
    *   No prior authentication is required for the attacks, though admin access is the end goal.
