Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `cat_fldAuto` parameter within the `step1.asp` page of the PostcardMentor application. This parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-supplied input into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Both remote and blind SQL injection is possible. The vulnerability affects both MS SQL server and MS Access databases.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to various impacts, including:
    *   Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive information stored in the database.
    *   Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data in the database.
    *   Complete system compromise: In some cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to gain full control of the underlying system.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the web application's HTTP interface. Specifically, by crafting malicious SQL code within the `cat_fldAuto` parameter in the URL.
    Example: `http://localhost/PostcardMentor/step1.asp?cat_fldAuto={SQL}`

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific authentication or internal network access is explicitly required, indicating that this vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
