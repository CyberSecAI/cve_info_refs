```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The PHP Classifieds Script is vulnerable to SQL injection. The vulnerability occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can bypass authentication, access sensitive information from the database, and potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server. This can lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the server itself.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is present in the browse.php and search.php scripts. The attack is carried out via the fatherID parameter. By manipulating this parameter with a crafted SQL injection payload, an attacker can extract sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and email addresses.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need prior authentication.
