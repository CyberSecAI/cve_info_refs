Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `index.php` file of the Aprox CMS Engine. Specifically, the application directly includes a file specified through the `page` GET parameter without sufficient checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files from the server's file system. This is due to the insecure use of the `include()` function combined with the lack of input validation of the `page` parameter.
- **Path Traversal:** The ability to use `../` sequences within the `page` parameter allows an attacker to navigate the file system and access files outside the intended directory.
- **Null Byte Injection:** The use of `%00` allows the attacker to truncate the `.inc` extension added by the application, which is used to validate the file extension and include arbitrary file names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read any file on the server that the webserver user has access to. This can include configuration files, database credentials, and other sensitive data.
- **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Although not directly mentioned in the report, if an attacker could upload a PHP file to the server (which would require a separate vulnerability), they could potentially execute arbitrary PHP code on the server using this LFI vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious GET request to `index.php` and setting the `page` parameter to a path that points to a sensitive file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable Aprox CMS Engine.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP GET requests.
- **Knowledge of the server's file structure (optional):** While an attacker can guess file paths, knowledge of the server's structure makes exploitation more targeted and effective.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit leverages the `include()` function in PHP which does not sanitize the supplied filename.
- The exploit uses `../` sequences to perform directory traversal and `%00` to bypass the `.inc` file extension check.
- The provided example shows how to access `C:\xampp\xampp-changes.txt` on a Windows system, demonstrating the ability to read arbitrary files.
- The exploit can be adapted to read other sensitive files, such as `/etc/passwd` on Linux systems.
- The exploit author classifies the risk level as medium.
