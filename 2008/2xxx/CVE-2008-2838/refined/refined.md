    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user input used in the 'module' parameter of the 'index.php' file and the 'query' parameter in the 'search' module.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI) via the 'module' parameter in index.php",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the 'query' parameter in the search module"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": [
      "Local File Inclusion: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server by manipulating the 'module' parameter to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../) and null byte termination (%00) to bypass file extension checks.",
      "Cross-Site Scripting: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application via the 'query' parameter, which is executed when the page is viewed by another user."
    ],
    "Attack vectors": [
      "LFI: HTTP GET request to index.php with a crafted 'module' parameter.",
      "XSS: HTTP POST request to index.php with a crafted 'query' parameter."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit either vulnerability."
