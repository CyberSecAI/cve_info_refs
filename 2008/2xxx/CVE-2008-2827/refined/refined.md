    "CVE-2008-2827": {
      "details": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in the `File::Path::rmtree` function of Perl, specifically in versions 5.10.0 and earlier. The vulnerability arises from an incorrect permission check before performing a chmod operation on symbolic links. \n\nRoot cause: The `rmtree` function attempts to ensure that files can be deleted by making them writable before unlinking them. In Perl 5.10.0, the code was changed such that the check for the `$Force_Writeable` variable was moved after the chmod call, where it previously was checked before the `chmod`, leading to a scenario where permissions are always modified on symlink targets. This behavior contrasts with the behavior in Perl 5.8.8, where the erroneous `chmod` is only executed if the `$force_writeable` variable is true, which is never the case on Debian systems.\n\nWeaknesses: The primary weakness is the incorrect handling of symbolic links in the `File::Path::rmtree` function. Instead of modifying the permissions of the symlink itself, the `chmod` operation is applied to the target of the symlink. This occurs because the `chmod` function follows symbolic links, and `rmtree` does not check if the entry is a symlink before calling chmod in affected versions.\n\nVulnerability: \n- Improper permission check before chmod.\n- `chmod` follows symlinks, modifying permissions of the symlink target.\n- `rmtree` fails to check if the entry is a symlink before calling `chmod` in affected versions.\n\nImpact: A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to change the permissions of arbitrary files by creating a symbolic link to the target file and then using a script that calls File::Path::rmtree on the symlink. This could potentially lead to privilege escalation or denial of service scenarios.\n\nAttack Vectors: \n- Creation of a symbolic link to a target file\n- Execution of a Perl script using the vulnerable File::Path::rmtree function on the symlink.\n\nRequired Capabilities/Position: \n- Local user access to execute perl scripts\n- Ability to create symlinks\n\nMore Details:\n- The vulnerability is triggered when using `File::Path::rmtree` with a symlink. This function is used in other packages, including `debsums`.\n- The issue can lead to a situation where package installation modifies the permissions of files outside the package directory.\n- The fix involves ensuring that chmod is not called on symlink targets.\n- The vulnerability is present in Perl 5.10.0 but not in Perl 5.8.8, and the faulty code block was introduced when the code was rewritten in 5.10.0.\n- The fix includes verifying the `$Force_Writeable` variable before calling chmod.",
      "cve_description": "The rmtree function in lib/File/Path.pm in Perl 5.10 does not properly check permissions before performing a chmod, which allows local users to modify the permissions of arbitrary files via a symlink attack, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-0448 and CVE-2004-0452."
