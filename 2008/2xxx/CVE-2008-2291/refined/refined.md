Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2291:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability resides in the `axengine.exe` service of Symantec Altiris Deployment Solution, which listens on TCP port 402 by default.
*   The service permits a remote client to request encrypted domain credentials without requiring authentication.
*   The encryption mechanism used is weak as it lacks a salt, enabling attackers with a local installation of Altiris Deployment Solution to easily decrypt the obtained credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The service allows requests for domain credentials without verifying the identity of the requester.
*   **Weak Encryption:** The encryption algorithm does not use a salt, making the credentials susceptible to decryption.
*   **Credential Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to exposure of domain credentials, which can be abused for further malicious activities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Domain Credential Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain domain credentials remotely.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** With the leaked domain credentials, an attacker can potentially gain access to other resources or elevate their privileges within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack can be carried out remotely over a network.
*   **Specific Service:** The vulnerability is located in the `axengine.exe` service listening on TCP port 402.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system running Symantec Altiris Deployment Solution.
*  **Local Altiris Installation (for decryption):** While the initial exploit can be done remotely and without authentication, an attacker requires a local installation of Altiris to easily decrypt the intercepted credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory from the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) provides more specific details about the vulnerability, including the service and port involved, the lack of authentication, and the weakness of the encryption.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by a Digital Vaccine filter.
*   Symantec has released an update to patch the vulnerability.
