- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application `cmreams CMS 1.3.1.1 beta2` is vulnerable to both Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -   **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**: The `load_language.php` script is vulnerable to LFI via the `page_language` parameter, allowing an attacker to include local files from the server.
    -   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The `umleitung.php` script is vulnerable to XSS via the `lang[be_red_text]` parameter.
-  **Impact of exploitation**:
    -   **LFI**: An attacker can potentially gain system access by including and executing malicious local files on the server.
    -   **XSS**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.
-   **Attack vectors**:
    -   **LFI**: Sending a crafted GET request to `load_language.php` with a malicious file path in the `page_language` parameter.
    -   **XSS**: Sending a crafted GET request to `umleitung.php` with malicious script in the `lang[be_red_text]` parameter.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    -   No authentication is mentioned in the exploit details, suggesting that these vulnerabilities can be exploited without authentication, if accessible.
