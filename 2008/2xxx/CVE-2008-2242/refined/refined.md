Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-2242:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper bounds checking within the `xdr_rwsstring()` library function. This function is used to process strings, and a lack of proper bounds checking allows for a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow. By sending a large string to a vulnerable daemon via the `xdr_rwsstring()` function, an attacker can overwrite data on the stack.
- Improper bounds checking: The root of the problem is the missing or inadequate bounds checking in `xdr_rwsstring()` when handling string input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a malicious parameter to a daemon using the vulnerable `xdr_rwsstring()` function.
- No user interaction: User interaction is not required to trigger the vulnerability. An attacker can initiate the attack directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable system.
- Ability to send crafted parameters: The attacker must be able to send a long string parameter to the vulnerable service.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2006-09-12, and a coordinated public release of the advisory was done on 2008-05-19.
- CA issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers were protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '4931'.
