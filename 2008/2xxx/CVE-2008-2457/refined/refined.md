Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2457:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability located in the `jokes_category.php` file of the PHP Jokesite 2.0 application. Specifically, the `cat_id` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization for the `cat_id` parameter, leading to SQL injection. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Access:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data in the application's database.
*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive data, including user information, could be exposed to an attacker.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** Depending on the application and database permissions, the attacker could gain control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `jokes_category.php` script.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attack involves injecting malicious SQL code via the `cat_id` parameter within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs to be familiar with manipulating HTTP requests and have knowledge of SQL.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit does not require prior authentication; the vulnerability is accessible directly through the web interface.

**Exploit Example:**

The exploit provided in the exploit-db content is:
`www.site.me/jokes_category.php?cat_id=-99999999'+union+select+0,1,2,3,database(),5,6,7,8,9,10,user(),12/*`

This URL demonstrates how an attacker can inject SQL code to extract the database name and user.

**Summary**
This vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `jokes_category.php` script of PHP Jokesite 2.0. It stems from unsanitized input via the `cat_id` parameter, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries. Successful exploitation could lead to data breaches and potentially server takeover, requiring only network access and web/SQL knowledge.
