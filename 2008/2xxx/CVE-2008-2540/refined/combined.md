## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Where are the file information details?**

The file information details can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 959426](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/959426).

**How is this security update related to MS09-014?**

The Blended Threat Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability, [CVE-2008-2540](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2540), described in this security bulletin also affects Internet Explorer. Microsoft recommends that users also install the security update provided by [MS09-014](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146659), Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (963027).

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the **Vulnerability Information** section of this bulletin, this update includes a defense-in-depth change that introduces a new API, called SetSearchPathMode.

**What does the SetSearchPathMode defense-in-depth change allow?**

This new API allows for a per-process mode when using the SearchPath function to locate files. This allows applications to force the current directory to be searched after the application and system locations.

**If I only apply this security update, will I be completely protected from the blended threat issue described in CVE-2008-2540?**

No, you must also separately enable the defense-in-depth protection provided by the Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer, [MS09-014](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146659). However, you must verify that enabling this defense-in-depth protection against the blended threat issue is appropriate for your environment.

To enable the defense-in-depth protection in Internet Explorer, enable the SearchPath feature control key described in the section, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update, in [MS09-014](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146659). For more information about the blended threat issue, see Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2008-2540](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2540).

**Why is Microsoft Windows 2000 listed in the Affected Software table without a security impact and a severity rating?**
Microsoft Windows 2000 is listed without a security impact and a severity rating because this update does not have the same fix for Microsoft Windows 2000 as for other supported Windows operating systems. Instead, this update only has a defense-in-depth change specific to Microsoft Windows 2000.

**Why is the fix for the blended threat issue in Microsoft Windows 2000 different than for other platforms?**
The architecture for implementing the SetSearchPathMode function does not exist on the Microsoft Windows 2000 system, making it infeasible to eliminate the vulnerability in Microsoft Windows 2000. To do so would require rearchitecting a significant portion of the Microsoft Windows 2000 operating system, not just the affected component. The end result of such efforts would be sufficiently incompatible with Microsoft Windows 2000 that there would be no assurance that applications designed to run on Microsoft Windows 2000 would continue to operate on the rearchitected system. However, Microsoft is unaware of any valid attack vectors that would target this vulnerability on Microsoft Windows 2000.

Due to these architectural changes, for Microsoft Windows 2000, you must enable the defense-in-depth change specific to Microsoft Windows 2000 by using the registry key, HKLM\System\CCS\control\Session Manager\SafeDLLSearchMode. For instructions, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 959426](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/959426). For more information, please see the MSDN article, [Dynamic-Link Library Search Order](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms682586.aspx).

**What is the SearchPath function?**

The SearchPath function is used to search for a specific file in a specified path. For more information, see the MSDN article, [SearchPath Function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa365527.aspx).

**What is the LoadLibrary function?**

The LoadLibrary function loads the specified module into the address space of the calling process. The specified module may cause other modules to be loaded. For more information, see the MSDN article, [LoadLibrary Function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms684175%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-014 - Critical

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (963027)

Published: April 14, 2009 | Updated: July 21, 2010

**Version:** 1.4

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves four privately reported vulnerabilities and two publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer or if a user connects to an attacker's server by way of the HTTP protocol. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 5.01 and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, running on supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000; Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7 running on supported editions of Windows XP; and Internet Explorer 7 running on supported editions of Windows Vista. For Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7 running on supported editions of Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008, this security update is rated Important. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses these vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer searches the system for files to load, performs authentication reply validation, handles transition errors when navigating between Web pages, and handles memory objects. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 953818](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/953818).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 963027](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/963027) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.

Microsoft recommends that users also install the security update provided by [MS09-015](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146803), Blended Threat Vulnerability in SearchPath Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (959426).

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the **Vulnerability Information** section of this bulletin, this update includes the following defense-in-depth changes:

* A change corresponding to the fix in [MS09-010](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=139849) (Vulnerability in WordPad and Office Text Converters Could Allow Remote Code Execution (960477))
* A change reinforcing the **about:** protocol in order to restrict spoofing
* A change corresponding to the fix in [MS09-015](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146803) (Blended Threat Vulnerability in SearchPath Could Allow Escalation of Privilege (959426)). This provides a mitigation of the combined threat issue involving Apple Safari, Microsoft Windows, and Microsoft Internet Explorer that is known publicly and has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2008-2540](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2540). See also the FAQ below about blended threat\*\*.\*\*

**Does this update address the known issue for MS09-002 that is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 967941?**

Yes, this update addresses the known issue for [MS09-002](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=139814) that is documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 967941](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/967941), "Navigation is canceled when you browse to Web pages that are in different Internet Explorer security zones."

**If I had already performed the registry workaround for the issue documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 967941, what else do I need to do?**

If you had followed the instructions in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 967941](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/967941) to either manually edit or run the wizard to edit the registry to enable the feature control key that disables the functionality introduced in [MS09-002](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=139814), then you must now reverse this feature control key. For instructions, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 967941](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/967941).

**If I only apply this update, will I be completely protected from the blended threat issue described in CVE-2008-2540?**

No, you must separately enable the defense-in-depth protection provided by this Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer, in addition to applying [MS09-015](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146803) (Blended Threat Vulnerability in SearchPath Could Allow Escalation of Privilege (959426)). However, you must verify that enabling this defense-in-depth protection against the blended threat issue is appropriate for your environment.

To enable the defense-in-depth protection, perform the following steps:

1. Save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Enable\_SearchPath.reg, to add the feature control key:
   Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
   [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE\_ENABLESAFESEARCHPATH\_KB963027]
   "iexplore.exe"=dword:00000001
2. Then run Enable\_SearchPath.reg with the following command from an elevated command prompt:
   Regedit.exe /s Enable\_SearchPath.reg

For more information about the blended threat issue, see [MS09-015](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146803) (Blended Threat Vulnerability in SearchPath Could Allow Escalation of Privilege (959426)) and Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2008-2540](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2540).

**Is it possible to enable the Internet Explorer defense-in-depth protection for the blended threat vulnerability on Microsoft Windows 2000?**
No. Due to architectural differences, the defense-in-depth protection included with this bulletin for the blended threat vulnerability, [CVE-2008-2540](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2540), is not applicable to the Microsoft Windows 2000 platform. Enabling the defense-in-depth protection for Internet Explorer on Microsoft Windows 2000 will have no affect.

## WinINet Credential Reflection Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0550

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that WinINet handles NTLM credentials when a user connects to an attacker's server by way of the HTTP protocol. This vulnerability allows an attacker to replay the user's credentials back to the attacker and to execute code in the context of the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0550](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0550).

#### Mitigating Factors for WinINet Credential Reflection Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0550

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The most likely attack vector for exploiting this vulnerability would be SMB. The Windows Vista firewall blocks SMB traffic by default. A vulnerable client would need to be running a service that accepts NTLM authentication in order for an attack to be successful and the credentials reflected back as a result. By default, if a Vista system is not deployed in a Windows domain environment, the profile of the Windows Vista firewall is "public", thereby blocking SMB traffic.
* Internet Explorer does not provide credentials automatically to the Internet zone. A user would have to provide credentials through the browser.
* Windows Internet Explorer 8 is not affected by this vulnerability.

## Page Transition Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0551

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer handles transition when navigating between Web pages. As a result, system memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code if a user visited a specially crafted Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0551](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0551).

#### Mitigating Factors for Page Transition Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0551

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* Windows Internet Explorer 8 is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Page Transition Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0551

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

## Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0552

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0552](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0552).

#### Mitigating Factors for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0552

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* Windows Internet Explorer 7 and Windows Internet Explorer 8 are not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0552

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements.

This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites.

  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### FAQ for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0554

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has not been initialized or has been deleted, memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as a logged-on user. If th user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**What does the update do?**

The update modifies the way that Internet Explorer handles memory objects.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Microsoft issued a security bulletin which contained security
advisory MS09-014. This security update resolves reported
vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer which could allow remote code
execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using Internet
Explorer or if a user connects to an attacker's server by way of the
HTTP protocol. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2008-2540](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2540),
[CVE-2009-0550](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0550),
[CVE-2009-0551](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0551),
[CVE-2009-0552](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0552),
[CVE-2009-0553](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0553) and
[CVE-2009-0554](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0554) to these issues. A description of the vulnerability
may be found at:

* <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-014.mspx>

Certain Avaya products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and may be
affected by this vulnerability.

## 2. Avaya System Products:

Avaya system products include an
Operating System with the product when it is delivered. The system
products described below are delivered with a Microsoft Operating
System. Actions to be taken with these products are also described
below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Messaging Application Server | All | Low | Avaya recommends that customers install the security update as provided via Microsoft Windows Update. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya strongly recommends that
customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose
operating systems. Occasionally
vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or applications that come with the operating system.
These vulnerabilities often do not impact the
software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of
the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are
not affected by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Microsoft
Windows
platform may be. For affected Microsoft Operating Systems,
Microsoft recommends installing patches. Detailed instructions for
patching the Operating System are given by Microsoft at the following

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Navigation is canceled when you browse to Web pages that are in different Internet Explorer security zones

Applies ToWindows Server 2008 Datacenter without Hyper-V Windows Server 2008 Enterprise without Hyper-V Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-Based Systems Windows Server 2008 Standard without Hyper-V Windows Server 2008 Datacenter Windows Server 2008 Enterprise Windows Server 2008 Standard Windows Server 2008 Web Edition Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard Windows Server 2008 R2 Web Edition Windows Vista Business Windows Vista Enterprise Windows Vista Home Basic Windows Vista Home Premium Windows Vista Ultimate Windows Vista Enterprise 64-bit Edition Windows Vista Home Basic 64-bit Edition Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit Edition Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit Edition Windows Vista Business 64-bit Edition

## Symptoms

After you install security update 961260 (MS09-002) on a computer that is running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008, you may experience a problem when you visit some Web pages that are in different Internet Explorer security zones. When the problem occurs, you receive a message that resembles the following:

Navigation to the webpage was canceled
This problem occurs if the navigation causes Protected Mode settings to change from On to Off. You can determine which Internet Explorer security zone a Web page is in by looking at the status bar at the bottom of the Internet Explorer 7 window.

## Cause

This problem occurs because Internet Explorer 7 switches Protected Mode settings when certain Web pages are configured in the **Trusted Sites** area of the **Security** tab of the **Internet Options** dialog box. By default, Protected Mode is set to Off for Web sites that are configured in the **Trusted Sites** area.

## Resolution

### Security update information

To resolve this problem, install the most current cumulative security update for Internet Explorer. To install the most current updates, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

<http://update.microsoft.com>For more technical information about the most current cumulative security update for Internet Explorer, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/current.aspx>Note This update was first included in security update 963027 (MS09-014). For more information, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

[963027](http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/963027)MS09-014: Cumulative security update for Internet Explorer
Note If you previously applied either of the following workarounds that were previously documented in this article, you must remove the specific workaround.

Undo workaround method 3: Disable Protected Mode for the "Trusted Sites" zone

1. Click **Start** ![ Start button  ](https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/hotfix.windows/neutral/c4464ed9-9e29-1174-be15-25697813f419/871313c148bd5b9e2d73f40e5467dc2c9b1d968f.jpg), type Internet Options in the **Start Search** box, and then click **Internet Options** in the **Programs** list.
2. Click the **Security** tab, and then click **Trusted Sites** in the **Select a zone to view or change security settings** area.
3. Click to clear the **Enabled Protected Mode (requires restarting Internet Explorer)** check box, and then click **OK**.
4. Restart Internet Explorer.

Undo workaround method 4: Edit the registry to disable a Feature Control key that will enable the functionality that was introduced in security update 961260 (MS09-002)

To do this, modify the DWORD value that is named iexplore.exe and set its value to 1 in the following registry subkey:

**HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE\_RESTRICT\_ABOUT\_PROTOCOL**

ImportantThis section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

[322756](http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756)How to back up and restore the registry in Windows

1. Click **Start** ![ Start button  ](https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/hotfix.windows/neutral/c4464ed9-9e29-1174-be15-25697813f419/871313c148bd5b9e2d73f40e5467dc2c9b1d968f.jpg), type regedit in the **Start Search** box, and then click **regedit.exe** in the **Programs** list.

   ![ User Account Control permission  ](https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/hotfix.windows/neutral/9a0ea601-1557-95f6-185d-a8da453b86e7/9cd0479acf6778a2048bdfc4117050610c247962.jpg) If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click **Continue**.
2. Locate and then click the following subkey in the registry:

   **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE\_RESTRICT\_ABOUT\_PROTOCOL**Note If the "FEATURE\_RESTRICT\_ABOUT\_PROTOCOL" subkey does not exist, you do not need to go further because the specific workaround has not bee applied to the computer.
3. In the details pane, right-click **iexplore.exe**, and then click **Modify**.
4. In the **Value data** box, type 1, and then click **OK**.
5. Exit Registry Editor.
6. Restart Internet Explorer.

# Microsoft Security Advisory 953818

## Blended Threat from Combined Attack Using Appleâs Safari on the Windows Platform

Published: May 30, 2008 | Updated: April 14, 2009

**Version:** 2.0

Microsoft has investigated public reports of a blended threat that allows remote code execution on all supported versions of Windows XP and Windows Vista when Appleâs Safari for Windows has been installed. Safari is not installed with Windows XP or Windows Vista by default; it must be installed independently or through the Apple Software Update application. Customers running Safari on Windows should review this advisory.

We have issued Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-014](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146659), Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (963027), and [MS09-015](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146803), Blended Threat Vulnerability in SearchPath Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (959426), to address this issue. For more information about this issue, including download links for security updates, please review [MS09-014](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146659) and [MS09-015](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146803).

Apple Support has released a security advisory that addresses the vulnerability in Appleâs Safari 3.1.2 for Windows. Please see Apple security advisory [About the security content of Safari 3.1.2 for Windows](https://support.apple.com/kb/ht2092) for more information.

Mitigating Factors:

* Customers who have changed the default location where Safari downloads content to the local drive are not affected by this blended threat.

### General Information

## Overview

**Purpose of Advisory:** To provide customers with the initial notification and provide additional information regarding the impact to the affected Windows platforms.

**Advisory Status:** Advisory published.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the scope of the advisory?**

This advisory clarifies public reports of a blended threat which could allow remote code execution, affecting all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Vista. For a complete list of affected software, review the software listed in the âOverviewâ section.

**Is this a security vulnerability that requires Microsoft to issue a security update?**

We have issued Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-014](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146659), Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (963027), and [MS09-015](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146803), Blended Threat Vulnerability in SearchPath Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (959426), to address this issue.

**What causes this threat?**

A combination of the default download location in Safari and how the Windows desktop handles executables creates a blended threat in which files may be downloaded to a userâs machine without prompting, allowing them to be executed. Safari is available as a stand-alone install or through the Apple Software Update application.

**What might an attacker use this function to do?**

An attacker could trick users into visiting a specially crafted Web site that could download content to a userâs machine and execute the content locally using the same permissions as the logged-on user.

## Suggested Actions

* Apply the updates in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-014](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146659), Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (963027), and [MS09-015](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146803), Blended Threat Vulnerability in SearchPath Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (959426), that apply to your environment.
* If using Apple Safari on Windows, ensure that it is version 3.1.2 or higher. The latest Apple Safari update is available at [Apple Safari Download](https://www.apple.com/safari/download/).
* Review the Microsoft Knowledge Base Article that is associated with this advisory.

#### Workarounds

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* Change the download location of content in Safari to a newly created directory
  1. Create a new directory, such as c:\SafariDownload.
  2. In Safari, click **Edit**, then point to **Preferences**.
  3. At the option, **Save Downloaded Files to:**, select the newly created directory.
