  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-2702",
      "root_cause": "The FTP client does not properly sanitize filenames containing directory traversal sequences (backslash and forward-slash) that are received from an FTP server in response to the LIST command.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper sanitization of filenames",
        "Directory traversal vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on a user's system with the privileges of that user. This can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution by writing files into the user's Startup folder.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious FTP server sending directory listings with crafted file names containing directory traversal sequences."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to set up a malicious FTP server and trick the user into connecting and downloading from it. The attacker does not require prior authentication.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in how the client handles directory traversal sequences (../) in filenames returned by the serverâ€™s LIST command. The report provides detailed examples of malicious LIST responses using both forward and backslashes, along with a detailed Proof of Concept (POC) and instructions for testing."
