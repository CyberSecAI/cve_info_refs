```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `phpbb3.functions.php` file within the PHPRaider application. The `pConfig_auth[phpbb_path]` parameter is not properly sanitized and is used in an `include_once` statement, allowing a remote attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request with the `pConfig_auth[phpbb_path]` parameter to the vulnerable `phpbb3.functions.php` script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where PHPRaider is installed. No special privileges or prior authentication is required."
