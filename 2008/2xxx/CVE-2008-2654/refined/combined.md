How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

You're assuming that all automatic variables are allocated on the stack
and in-order, but neither has to be the case.  The compiler is free to
place these variables in registers (in which case it might or might not
also allocate stack space for them), to re-order the variables that it
does allocate stack space for, and even to optimize some variables out
if it can.

This means that the frame pointer attack is not out of consideration.
The risk is there.

I'd expect "ret" to be placed into a register, or at least cached in a
register, which explains why you're not able to affect its value.  Of
course, there's no guarantee that it won't be read back from the stack
in another build, allowing for the attack in case it's also placed right
above the buffer.  (I assume that you're on little-endian.)

I hope this helps.

True that makes sense. Thanks for pointing this out.
In this case it might be good to have a CVE id allocated for
this. Steve, can you provide one?

Yes this is little-endian(amd64) and having a deeper look at
the generated code you are right as well, this is indeed
place into a register.

Yes it does, thanks for your help!

# Motion: Execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200807-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Motion might result in the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/motion** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.2.10.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.2.10.1** |

### Background

Motion is a program that monitors the video signal from one or more
cameras and is able to detect motions.

### Description

Nico Golde reported an off-by-one error within the read\_client()
function in the webhttpd.c file, leading to a stack-based buffer
overflow. Stefan Cornelius (Secunia Research) reported a boundary error
within the same function, also leading to a stack-based buffer
overflow. Both vulnerabilities require that the HTTP Control interface
is enabled.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending an
overly long or specially crafted request to a vulnerable Motion HTTP
control interface, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the motion user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Motion users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/motion-3.2.10.1"
```

# CVE-2008-2654

| **Name** | CVE-2008-2654 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Off-by-one error in the read\_client function in webhttpd.c in Motion 3.2.10 and earlier might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long request to a Motion HTTP Control interface, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow with some combinations of processor architecture and compiler. |

Package: motion
Version: 3.2.9-2
Severity: minor

Hi,
there is an off-by-one programming error in webhttpd:
From webhttpd.c:
   1950 static int read_client(int client_socket, void *userdata, char *auth)
   ....
   1954         char buffer[1024] = {'\0'};
   1955         int length = 1024;
   ....
   1963                 int nread = 0, readb = -1;
   1964·
   1965                 nread = read (client_socket, buffer, length);
   1966·
   1967                 if (nread <= 0) {
   1968                         motion_log(LOG_ERR, 1, "httpd First read");
   1969                         pthread_mutex_unlock(&httpd_mutex);
   1970                         return -1;
   1971                 }
   1972                 else {
   1973                         char method[sizeof (buffer)];
   1974                         char url[sizeof (buffer)];
   1975                         char protocol[sizeof (buffer)];
   1976                         char *authentication=NULL;
   1977·
   1978                         buffer[nread] = '\0';

This function reads an HTTP request by a client connecting to the administration port of motion.·
If the client send exactly or more than 1024 as an HTTP request line 1978
will write one byte too far, to buffer[1024] as read in line 1965 will
return 1024 bytes.

Kind regards
Nico

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi,
in <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=484572> I
reported an off-by-one programming error in motion:

1950 static int read_client(int client_socket, void *userdata, char *auth)
....
1953         int ret = 1;
1954         char buffer[1024] = {'\0'};
1955         int length = 1024;
....
1963                 int nread = 0, readb = -1;
1964·
1965                 nread = read (client_socket, buffer, length);
1966·
1967                 if (nread <= 0) {
1968                         motion_log(LOG_ERR, 1, "httpd First read");
1969                         pthread_mutex_unlock(&httpd_mutex);
1970                         return -1;
1971                 }
1972                 else {
1973                         char method[sizeof (buffer)];
1974                         char url[sizeof (buffer)];
1975                         char protocol[sizeof (buffer)];
1976                         char *authentication=NULL;
1977·
1978                         buffer[nread] = '\0';
....
2073         return ret;

If the clients sends 1024 or more bytes this leads to an off-by-one writing
to buffer[1024]. However I am unsure about the exploitability at the moment.
Overwriting the frame pointer should be not possible since there are variables
on the stack before buffer.

However it should be possible to overwrite ret with 0 which is used in line 2073 as
the return value of the function (normal termination returns 1).

The value of ret is used as a check for a while loop which handles the incoming \
connections: 2181         while ((client_sent_quit_message!=0) && (!closehttpd)) {
2182
2183                 client_socket_fd = acceptnonblocking(sd, 1);
2184
2185                 if (client_socket_fd<0) {
....
2190                 } else {
2191                         /* Get the Client request */
2192                         client_sent_quit_message = read_client \
                (client_socket_fd, cnt, authentication);
....
2196                         if (client_socket_fd)
2197                                 close(client_socket_fd);
2198                 }
2200         }

So if read_client will be evaluated to 0 the while condition in 2181 should
be evaluated to false which causes the server to not accept connections on
the http port anymore.

This is the theoretical point but I was not able to reproduce this on
a 64bit system. Does anyone have an idea why this could be the case or
is even able to reproduce this?

Install motion and send an arbitrary HTTP request to port 8080 with a
lengt >= 1024.

Opinions?

Cheers
Nico

| [Description](#c0)  kde123    2002-04-30 06:22:03 UTC  ``` abiword works just fine without gnome support, but the ebuild forces it.  I  would suggest ebuilds for abiword-gnome and abiword (no gnome support). ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Seemant Kulleen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-30 07:14:51 UTC  ``` The ebuild does not force it.  Have you read any of the documentation about Gentoo?  Please refer to the USE howto here: <http://www.gentoo.org/doc/use-howto.html>  Once you read that, you'll see that gnome and kde are not being pulled in to most of your bugs.  The only one I can not argue with is the gdk-pixbuf one you have. ``` |  |
