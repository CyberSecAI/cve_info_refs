Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `category.php` script. Specifically, the `cate_id` parameter is not sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query's logic and retrieve arbitrary data.

*  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and retrieve sensitive information, specifically admin usernames and passwords, potentially leading to complete control of the application.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `category.php`, by manipulating the `cate_id` parameter.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. No authentication is required for the initial exploit of the SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit code is:

```
http://localhost.com/[PaTs]/category.php?cate_id=-1+union+select+1,concat(user_name,0x3a,password),3,4+from+admin--
```

This URL injects a malicious SQL query by utilizing a `UNION SELECT` statement. Specifically:
    *   `-1` is used to ensure that no valid results from the original query are returned.
    *   `union select 1,concat(user_name,0x3a,password),3,4 from admin` is the SQL injection payload. This selects the `user_name` and `password` fields from the `admin` table (concatenated with a colon separator).
    *   `--` is used to comment out the rest of the original SQL query.

The attacker leverages the injection to extract concatenated usernames and passwords from the `admin` table. This is then used to log in via the `admin/index.php` page.
