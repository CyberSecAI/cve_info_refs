Researcher                    Roberto Suggi Liverani roberto.suggi@security-assessment.com

Description
SugarCRM Community Edition is vulnerable to local file contents disclosure. This
vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious user to disclose potentially sensitive
information. The flaw is caused due to a lack of input filtering in the SugarCRM RSS
module, which can be exploited to disclose the content of local files.
The RSS module allows SugarCRM users to add RSS feeds to their personal RSS list. The application expects an
URL value pointing to a valid RSS feed. However, the URL variable value is not properly sanitised and any URI
value can be entered instead. In this particular case, it was discovered that it is possible to enter a file path to
any files on the local system hosting the SugarCRM application.
As a result SugarCRM does not display the new RSS feed in the list as it is not a valid RSS URL Feed. However,
the application creates a local file with the filename of the md5 hash of the URL entered. The file is created in
the directory cache/feeds . If the Apache web server is used, the file is created with the user www-data
containing read permission.

Exploitation
An exploitation example in a LAMP (Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP) environment:
If an authenticated attacker enters a value of â€œ/etc/passwdâ€ (without quotes) in the RSS URL field, the
application will generate a MD5 hash of the string containing the file path. In this case, the value â€œ/etc/passwdâ€
is hashed to â€œc5068b7c2b1707f8939b283a2758a691â€ (without quotes). The MD5 hash is then used as a
filename with the file contents of /etc/passwd. The file /etc/passwd can then be viewable publicly at
http://sugarwebsiteaddress/cache/feeds/c5068b7c2b1707f8939b283a2758a691 .

Exploitation of this flaw does not require authentication.
The URL variable is handled by the /modules/Feeds/Feed.php page. The array variable $url is passed without
filtering to the xml_domit_rss_document function at the following line:
$rssdoc = new xml_domit_rss_document ($this->url, â€˜cache/feeds/â€™, 3600);
The XML domit RSS plugin is then called and retrieves the file content at the path given and then generate the
MD5 hashed file in the cache/feeds folder as instructed by the function in Feed.php .

Solution
Install the vendor supplied patches.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

========================================================================
= SugarCRM Community Edition Local File Disclosure Vulnerability
=
= Vendor Website:
= http://www.sugarcrm.com
=
= Affected Version:
= -- SugarCRM Community Edition 4.5.1
= -- SugarCRM Community Edition 5.0.0
=
= Public disclosure on 29th April 2008
=
========================================================================
Available online at:
http://www.security-assessment.com/files/advisories/2008-04-29\_SugarCRM\_
local\_file\_disclosure.pdf
== Overview ==
SugarCRM Community Edition is vulnerable to local file contents
disclosure.
This vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious user to disclose
potentially sensitive information. The flaw is caused due to a lack of
input filtering in the SugarCRM RSS module, which can be exploited
to disclose the content of local files.
The RSS module allows SugarCRM users to add RSS feeds to their personal
RSS list. The application expects an URL value pointing to a valid RSS
feed.
However, the URL variable value is not properly sanitised and any URI
value can be entered instead. In this particular case, it was discovered
that it is possible to enter a file path to any files on the local
system hosting the SugarCRM application.
As a result SugarCRM does not display the new RSS feed in the list as it
is not a valid RSS URL Feed. However, the application creates a local
file with the filename of the md5 hash of the URL entered. The file is
created in the directory cache/feeds . If the Apache web server is used,
the file is created with the user www-data containing read permission.
== Exploitation ==
An exploitation example in a LAMP (Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP)
environment:
If an authenticated attacker enters a value of ?/etc/passwd?
(without quotes) in the RSS URL field, the application will generate a
MD5 hash of the string containing the file path. In this case,
the value ?/etc/passwd? is hashed to ?c5068b7c2b1707f8939b283a2758a691
? (without quotes). The MD5 hash is then used as a filename with the
file contents of /etc/passwd. The file /etc/passwd can then be viewable
publicly at http://sugarwebsiteaddress/cache/feeds/c5068b7c2b1707f8939b2
83a2758a691 .
Exploitation of this flaw does not require authentication.
The URL variable is handled by the /modules/Feeds/Feed.php page.
The array variable $url is passed without filtering to the
xml\_domit\_rss\_document function at the following line:
$rssdoc = new xml\_domit\_rss\_document ($this->url, ?cache/feeds/?, 3600);
The XML domit RSS plugin is then called and retrieves the file content
at the path given and then generate the MD5 hashed file in the
cache/feeds folder as instructed by the function in Feed.php .
== Solutions ==
Install the vendor supplied patches.
