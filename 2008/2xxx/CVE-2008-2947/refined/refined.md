    "CVE-2008-2947": {
      "root_cause": "Internet Explorer incorrectly interprets the origin of script, allowing it to run in the context of a domain or Internet Explorer security zone other than where it originated.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-domain scripting violation",
        "Improper enforcement of the cross-domain security model when a page location is modified through use of an object, rather than a string."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution or information disclosure. An attacker who successfully exploited the remote code execution vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user, potentially taking complete control of an affected system. The information disclosure vulnerability could allow an attacker to read cookies or other data from another security zone or domain in Internet Explorer.",

        "Convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message).",
        "Hosting a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer.",
