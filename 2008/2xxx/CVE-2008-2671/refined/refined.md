Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2671

**Vulnerable Software:** DCFM Blog 0.9.4

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL Injection in the `comments.php` script of the DCFM Blog application. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach/Disclosure:** The attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  The attacker might be able to modify or delete data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database permissions, the attacker could potentially gain higher levels of access to the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to the `comments.php` script.
*   **`id` Parameter:** The `id` parameter in the POST request is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the web application.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how HTTP requests and forms work.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to write SQL injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit code uses the following payload in the `id` parameter:
```
-99' union select 0,username,password from accounts where id=1/*
```
This SQL injection attempts to:
1.  Close the original SQL query by using a single quote `'`.
2.  Use `UNION SELECT` to combine the results of another query with the original results.
3.  Select the `username` and `password` from the `accounts` table where `id` equals `1` and displays this information
4.  Comment out the rest of the original query by using `/*`

This injection bypasses the intended logic of the SQL query and allows the attacker to retrieve the username and password of the first user in the `accounts` table.
