Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2008-2065:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content from exploit-db.com explicitly mentions "CVE: [2008-2065](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-2065)" and describes a SQL injection vulnerability in a script named `jokes.php`. This directly correlates with the CVE ID specified.
   - The provided link also leads to the CVE record.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `catagorie` parameter of the `jokes.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection.  The `catagorie` parameter is directly incorporated into a SQL query without being properly sanitized.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Database Exposure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to gain unauthorized access to the database. They could retrieve sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, or other confidential information stored in the database.
   - **Database Modification:** An attacker can potentially modify or delete data within the database. This could lead to data loss, data corruption, or complete compromise of the application.
   - **Server Compromise (Potentially):** Depending on the database user's permissions, an attacker could potentially escalate the attack to gain control of the underlying server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

    - The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `catagorie` parameter in the URL.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - The attacker needs to have the ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No authentication is required to perform the injection.

**Technical Details:**
   - The exploit-db entry gives a sample attack URL: `jokes.php?catagorie=-1%20union%20select%201,convert(concat(database(),char(58),user(),char(58),version()),char)/*`.
     - This URL shows a basic method to inject SQL code to extract database, user, and version information.
   - The provided dork `allinurl:"jokes.php?catagorie="` indicates a way to identify vulnerable sites using search engines, showing the attack is readily exploitable by anyone with access to the internet.
