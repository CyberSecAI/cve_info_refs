| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=453916#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-07-03 08:38:33 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in a Accept Language HTTP header parsers implemented in adminutil library used by various Red Hat Directory Server's Administration Server's CGI scripts.  A remote attacker able to connect to Administration Server web interface could cause a CGI scripts to crash, or possibly execute an arbitrary code.  Issue affects: - Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 - adminutil packages shipped in Red Hat Directory Server 8 and Fedora Directory Server, prior to adminutil version 1.1.7   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=453916#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2008-07-09 14:34:03 UTC  ``` Further investigation showed that even though adminutil as shipped with Red Hat Directory Server 8 contain vulnerable code, it is not used by any CGI script shipped with Directory Server 8.  Directory Administration Server CGI scripts do not use affected code.  Directory Server Gateway (DSGW), which is affected on Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 and Fedora Directory Server (fedora-ds-dsgw package), is not shipped with Red Hat Directory Server 8.  Due to that, this issue will not be treated as security sensitive for Red Hat Directory Server 8, but may be fixed as bugfix in future adminutil package updates.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=453916#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2008-08-27 20:15:37 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=453916#c6)  Fedora Update System    2008-09-10 06:49:56 UTC  ``` adminutil-1.1.7-1.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=453916#c7)  Fedora Update System    2008-09-10 07:18:13 UTC  ``` adminutil-1.1.7-1.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
