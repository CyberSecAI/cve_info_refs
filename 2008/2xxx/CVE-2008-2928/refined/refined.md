Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2928:

**Root Cause:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `Accept-Language` HTTP header parser within the `adminutil` library. This library is utilized by CGI scripts of the Red Hat Directory Server's Administration Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Buffer Overflow: The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow when processing the `Accept-Language` HTTP header. The `adminutil` library does not properly validate the size of the input, leading to potential memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** A remote attacker could send a specially crafted `Accept-Language` header, causing the vulnerable CGI scripts to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** The bug report suggests a *possibility* of arbitrary code execution. While not explicitly confirmed, a buffer overflow could, under certain circumstances, be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by anyone who can connect to the Administration Server's web interface.
- **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious `Accept-Language` HTTP header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network access to the Red Hat Directory Server's Administration Server web interface.
- The attacker does not need authentication. They can trigger the vulnerability by simply sending a malicious HTTP request with a crafted `Accept-Language` header.

**Additional Notes:**
- Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 is confirmed to be affected.
-  The `adminutil` packages shipped in Red Hat Directory Server 8 and Fedora Directory Server are also vulnerable, but the specific code is not used by default in Red Hat Directory Server 8's CGI scripts.
-  Directory Server Gateway (DSGW), which uses the vulnerable code, is affected in Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 and Fedora Directory Server but is not shipped with Red Hat Directory Server 8.
- A fix was released in `adminutil` version 1.1.7.
- Red Hat released a security advisory (RHSA-2008:0596) to address this issue.
- This vulnerability was considered high priority and high severity.
