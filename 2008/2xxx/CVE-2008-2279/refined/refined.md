```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses an insecure MySQL query, allowing for arbitrary SQL code execution.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection vulnerability in `browseproject.php`.
- Impact of exploitation:  A remote attacker can execute arbitrary MySQL code/queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, including administrator login details (usernames and passwords stored in plaintext).
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a modified `pid` parameter in `browseproject.php`.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges are required.
