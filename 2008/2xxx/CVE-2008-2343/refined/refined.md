The provided content from Exploit Database describes multiple vulnerabilities in News Manager 2.0. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/ch_readalso.php` script includes external files specified via the `read_xml_include` parameter without proper sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:** Unvalidated user-controlled input passed to an include function
    *   **Attack Vector:** By supplying a malicious URL through the `read_xml_include` parameter, an attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to compromise the server.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

2.  **Remote File Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/attachments.php` and `/login/attachments.php` scripts are vulnerable to path traversal.
    *   **Weakness:**  Insufficient sanitization of the `id` parameter allows directory traversal via `../` sequences.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By crafting the `id` parameter with `../../` sequences, an attacker can access arbitrary files on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive data such as `/etc/passwd`.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

3.  **Remote SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Several scripts (`/list_tagitems.php`, `/advsearch.php`, `/archive.php`, `/index.php`) are vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in SQL queries.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By injecting SQL code through the `pid` or `lang` parameters, attackers can manipulate database queries.
    *   **Impact:** Database compromise, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

4.  **Remote Permission Bypass:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/db/connect_str.php` file contains database credentials.
    *   **Weakness:** The file is directly accessible and contains sensitive database credentials (username, password, database name).
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the file leaks database credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information such as database credentials.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable endpoint.

5.  **PHPINFO Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/login/info.php` exposes PHP configuration information.
    *   **Weakness:** PHPINFO is accessible to the public
    *  **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the file reveals sensitive server configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially aiding further attacks.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable endpoint.
