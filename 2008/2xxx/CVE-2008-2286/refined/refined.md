Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-2286:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of numeric input fields within the "UpdateComputer" notification requests processed by `axengine.exe` in Symantec Altiris Deployment Solution. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL statements into the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied numeric input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the target system. The code runs under the context of the SYSTEM user, which provides complete control over the compromised machine.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain extended privileges on the target system.
- **Local Application Authentication Control:** The exploit can disable or enable local application authentication by executing SQL commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, making it accessible over a network.
- **Network:** The vulnerable service, `axengine.exe`, listens on TCP port 402 by default, allowing network-based attacks.
- **Specifically Crafted Network Packets:** The attack involves sending specially crafted `UpdateComputer` notification requests to the vulnerable service. These requests contain the malicious SQL injection code in the `Processor-Speed` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the target system on port 402.
- **Knowledge of the Protocol:** The attacker needs to know the structure and parameters used in the `UpdateComputer` requests to inject the malicious SQL code.
- **TFTP Client:** The target system needs to have a TFTP client available for retrieving and executing a payload.
- **Ability to Craft SQL Queries:** The attacker needs to be able to write SQL queries, which will be injected to enable xp_cmdshell, retrieve the payload via TFTP, and finally execute it.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Symantec Altiris Deployment Solution versions 6.8 to 6.9.164.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Brett Moore of Insomnia Security.
- Metasploit has a module to automate the exploitation of this vulnerability.
- The exploitation process involves multiple SQL injection steps, including enabling `xp_cmdshell`, retrieving a payload, and executing it.
- The exploit can enable or disable application authentication on the target system.
- Symantec has released an update to address this vulnerability (KB 41418).
