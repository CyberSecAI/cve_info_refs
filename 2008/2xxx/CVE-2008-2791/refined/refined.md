Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2791:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability present in the "Comparison Engine Power 1.0" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application's `product.detail.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter. It's a "blind" SQL injection because the attacker doesn't directly see the results of the query. Instead, the attacker infers results based on whether a known string ("tourterms.pdf") is present in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, specifically the MD5 hash of the `password` from the `auto_admin_settings_tb` table.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** By gaining access to the admin password hash, the attacker could potentially compromise the entire application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `product.detail.php` script, injecting SQL code into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to understand how SQL injection works in order to craft the malicious queries.
- **Basic Scripting Skills:** The provided exploit is written in Perl, so some scripting knowledge would be helpful to use or modify the exploit.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit code provided uses a brute-force approach to extract the MD5 hash, one character at a time.
- The exploit uses the presence of "tourterms.pdf" in the response as an indicator that the injected SQL query was successful. This is a common technique for blind SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- The exploit allows to specify a proxy for the request.
- The target application uses PHP.
