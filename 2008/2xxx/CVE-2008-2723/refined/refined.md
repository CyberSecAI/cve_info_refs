The provided content relates to CVE-2008-2723.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities were discovered in internal security audits of Gallery 2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **XSS through host and path component of request URL:** The request URL was not properly sanitized, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Information disclosure in album-select module:** The album-select module exposed album titles when a guest tried to add a new album to a hidden album.
*   **Permission escalation through zip archive extraction:** Sub-albums were created when adding items from a ZIP archive, even if the user lacked the necessary permission.
*   **Information disclosure through embed.php:** The `embed.php` script was susceptible to remote address spoofing, which disclosed the local filesystem path of the Gallery 2 installation.
*  **View permissions not enforced for password protected items:** Non-album items could be password protected directly, but protection was not fully enforced.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts into the application.
*   **Information disclosure:** Sensitive information such as album titles and local file paths could be exposed.
*   **Permission escalation:** Users could bypass access controls and create unauthorized sub-albums.
*   **Inconsistent protection:** Password protection could fail, leading to unauthorized access of content.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **XSS:** By crafting a malicious URL.
*   **Information disclosure (album-select):** By attempting to add a new album to a hidden album as a guest.
*   **Permission escalation:** By uploading a ZIP archive containing sub-albums.
*   **Information disclosure (embed.php):** By spoofing the remote address in a request to `embed.php`.
* **View permissions (password protection):** By directly protecting non-album items.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   For XSS, the attacker would need to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   For album-select information disclosure, the attacker would need to have guest access to the Gallery.
*   For permission escalation, the attacker needs to have file upload capabilities.
*   For embed.php information disclosure, the attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
*   For the password protection issue, the attacker would need some access to the gallery to access content.
