How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Heap-based buffer overflow in libxslt

---

Programs affected: libxslt-1.1.24 and some earlier versions.

Severity: Execution of evil stylesheets may result in arbitrary code
execution.Similarly to my Ghostscript note, XSLT is a turing-complete language. Executing
untrusted programs in said languages remains a challenge. The weak points on
the attack surface are often the built-in functions, which do things like take
integers as arguments...This advisory primarily notes a heap-based buffer overflow in the
`crypto:rc4_encrypt` function in `crypto.c`. The issue is
over-trust of the length of an incoming key string:
```

static void
exsltCryptoRc4EncryptFunction (xmlXPathParserContextPtr ctxt, int nargs) {
...
    key = xmlXPathPopString (ctxt);
    key_len = xmlUTF8Strlen (str);
...
    padkey = xmlMallocAtomic (RC4_KEY_LENGTH);
    key_size = xmlUTF8Strsize (key, key_len);
    memcpy (padkey, key, key_size);
    memset (padkey + key_size, '\0', sizeof (padkey));
...

```
As can be seen, the `padkey` heap allocation is of a fixed size, but
an arbitrary length string from the XSL function argument is copied on top.In addition, the `key_len` variable appears to be initialized
incorrectly. The length of the plaintext string is used rather than the length
of the key string.Furthermore, the attempt to zero-pad the key looks faulty.
`sizeof(padkey)` will always be `sizeof(void*)`.The function `crypto:rc4_decrypt` would seem to suffer the same
issues.Demo evil stylesheet:
```

<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings"
xmlns:crypto="http://exslt.org/crypto"
xmlns:math="http://exslt.org/math"
extension-element-prefixes="str crypto math">
<xsl:template match="/">
<xsl:value-of select="crypto:rc4_encrypt('AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA', 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA')"/>
blah
</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# libxslt: Execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200808-06**

libxslt is affected by a heap-based buffer overflow, possibly leading to
the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libxslt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.24-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.24-r1**< **1.1.8** |

### Background

libxslt is the XSLT C library developed for the GNOME project. XSLT is
an XML language to define transformations for XML.

### Description

Chris Evans (Google Security) reported that the libexslt library that
is part of libxslt is affected by a heap-based buffer overflow in the
RC4 encryption/decryption functions.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to process an XML file using a
specially crafted XSLT stylesheet in an application linked against
libxslt, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libxslt users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libxslt-1.1.24-r1"
```
### References

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-633-1: libxslt vulnerabilities

1 August 2008

libxslt vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [libxslt](/security/cves?package=libxslt) -

## Details

It was discovered that long transformation matches in libxslt could

overflow. If an attacker were able to make an application linked against

libxslt process malicious XSL style sheet input, they could execute

arbitrary code with user privileges or cause the application to crash,

leading to a denial of serivce. ([CVE-2008-1767](/security/CVE-2008-1767))

Chris Evans discovered that the RC4 processing code in libxslt did not

correctly handle corrupted key information. If a remote attacker were

able to make an application linked against libxslt process malicious

XML input, they could crash the application, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2008-2935](/security/CVE-2008-2935))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

2008/07/31 #2008-009 libxslt heap overflow
Description:
The libexslt library bundled with libxslt is affected by a heap-based buffer
overflow which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
The vulnerability is present in the rc4 encryption/decryption functions. An
arbitrary length string, passed as an argument in the XSL input, is
incorrectly copied over a padding variable which is previously allocated with
a fixed size of 128bit (RC4\_KEY\_LENGTH).
Aside from the heap overflow other bugs affect the code, the length of the
plaintext string argument is used for computing the key length rather than
the actual key and the zero-padding of the key is incorrectly computed.
A simple XML file with excessively long input can be crafted for triggering
the heap overflow.
The following patch fixes the issue:
http://www.ocert.org/patches/exslt\_crypt.patch
Affected version:
libxslt >= 1.1.8, <= 1.1.24
Fixed version:
libxslt, N/A
