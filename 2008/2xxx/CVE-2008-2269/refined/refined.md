Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2269

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Insecure cookie handling. The application sets an admin cookie with a value of "TRUE" if the user is an admin and "FALSE" otherwise. The application does not properly validate this cookie, allowing an attacker to set their own cookie and gain unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application relies solely on the value of a client-supplied cookie to determine admin privileges without proper server-side validation or authentication mechanisms.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability exists due to the lack of a proper authentication process that doesn't rely on client-controlled cookies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** By creating and setting a cookie with the name "gastracker\_admin" and a value of "TRUE," an attacker can bypass authentication checks and gain administrator access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Client-Side Manipulation:** The attack vector is client-side, achieved by using JavaScript to create and set a malicious cookie.
*   **Web Browser:** The attacker needs a web browser to inject the malicious javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how cookies work and how to use a browser's developer tools or address bar to execute javascript.
*   **No Prior Access Required:** The attacker doesn't need any prior access to the system or application beyond a web browser. They can perform the attack without being a registered user.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit involves injecting the following JavaScript code into a browser's address bar or developer console, after browsing to the vulnerable site:

```javascript
javascript:document.cookie = "gastracker_admin=TRUE; path=/";
```
This script sets a cookie named `gastracker_admin` with a value of `TRUE` and sets the path to `/`, making it valid for the entire application. Once this cookie is set, accessing the `/admin/` URL will grant the attacker administrative privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The application in question is AS-GasTracker 1.0.0.
*   The vendor was not notified at the time of discovery, according to the report.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by "t0pP8uZz."
*   The exploit was published on exploit-db.com and milw0rm.com on 2008-05-14.
