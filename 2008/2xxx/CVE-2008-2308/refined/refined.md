Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-2308:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory corruption issue exists in the handling of AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) volume mount information within an alias data structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Improper handling of AFP volume mount information within alias data structures. Specifically, a lack of validation of the data structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause an unexpected application termination.
- Arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  An attacker could craft a malicious alias file containing specifically crafted volume mount information.
-  This malicious alias would then need to be resolved by the targeted system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a maliciously crafted alias file.
- The attacker needs the target to attempt to resolve the malicious alias.

**Additional Notes:**
- This issue only affects Intel-based systems running Mac OS X 10.5.1 or earlier.
- The vulnerability is addressed by performing additional validation of alias data structures.
