Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2447

**Vulnerability Description:**
The e-107 Plugin ZoGo-Shop 1.16 Beta 13 is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the failure to properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `cat` parameter in `products.php` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `cat` parameter of `products.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- This could allow the attacker to potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify data, or potentially gain administrative control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted URL by manipulating the `cat` parameter in the `products.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- No authentication or special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided example exploit URL `http://www.xxx.com/e107_plugins/zogo-shop/products.php?cat=-1+union+select+database(),version(),3,4,5,6,user()/*` demonstrates how an attacker can inject SQL code by using a `UNION SELECT` statement. This query retrieves the database name, database version, and current user from the database.
