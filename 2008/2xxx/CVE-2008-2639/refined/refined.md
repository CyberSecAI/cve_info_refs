{
  "CVE-2008-2639": [
    {
      "Root cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the CitectSCADA ODBC service due to a lack of proper length checking of the read data.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Insufficient input validation"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted packets to the vulnerable service over TCP port 20222.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send network packets to the vulnerable service.",
        "More Details": "The application layer protocol reads an initial 4-byte packet specifying the length of the subsequent data packet. The service then reads a packet of that length, with a fixed 5-byte header, and copies the received data into a fixed-size stack buffer. By sending a length value greater than the size of the stack buffer, the attacker can cause a buffer overflow, overwriting the return address and enabling arbitrary code execution."
