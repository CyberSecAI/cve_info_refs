Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** flaw in the `editor.php` script of Power Editor 2.0.
*   The script uses user-supplied input without proper sanitization in the `$filename` variable, which is then used to open and read the file specified via the `te` and `dir` GET parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The script allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `te` (filename) and `dir` (directory) parameters.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The script does not validate or sanitize the `te` and `dir` parameters before using them in the file path.
*   **Hardcoded Password:** The default password for login is "changeme", making it easier for an attacker to gain access to the vulnerable feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd` or application configuration files. This can lead to information disclosure, including sensitive user data and server configuration details.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `te` and `dir` parameters are also vulnerable to XSS, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `editor.php` with specific parameters.
*   The vulnerable parameters are:
    *   `action=tempedit`: triggers the vulnerable code block
    *   `m`: base64 encoded password (default: `changeme`)
    *   `te`: the file to read (e.g., `/etc/passwd`)
    *   `dir`: directory traversal (e.g., `../../../../../../../../../..`)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of the application path:** The attacker needs to be aware of the path of the `editor.php` file and the structure of the URL.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The default password is known.

**Example Exploit URL:**

```
http://site.com/editor.php?action=tempedit&m=Y2hhbmdlbWU=&te=/etc/passwd&dir=../../../../../../../../../..
```
**Summary**

The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of the default password to perform LFI and potentially XSS.
