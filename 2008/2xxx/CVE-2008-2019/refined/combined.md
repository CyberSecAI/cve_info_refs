Last Edit: May 03, 2008, 09:57:49 PM by Oldiesmann

Simple Machines is proud to announce the release of SMF 1.1.5.

This version addresses a few security issues and fixes some small bugs.

We encourage all users to upgrade to SMF 1.1.5 as soon as possible, by either using the fast install option from the admin panel, or manually applying the changes attached to this message.

Among other things, this version fixes the following issues:
\* Sanitation of $topic wasn't always done right.
\* Increased the randomness of the Captcha sound.
\* Require the Memcached version that's compiled into PHP to ensure a better performance.
\* Improved the random generator seeding for PHP < 4.2.0 - issue reported by Jessica Hope.
\* Fixed a vulnerability with the use of the html-tag - issue reported by Jessica Hope.
\* Fixed the CRC function not working properly on 64-bit systems.
\* Fixed remembering the infocenter collapse status for guests.
\* Don't send the admin a new registration email just because a member changed their email address.

SMF 1.1.4 users:  Upgrading could not be easier. Simply log into your forum and visit your admin center - a notice should inform you an update is available. Follow the instructions to patch your release - this should not generally affect any modifications, language packs or themes you have installed. Alternatively download the attached patch file, upload to your "Packages" directory and visit the package manager to install this fix.

If you cannot upgrade using the package manager, please follow the instructions posted in the Online Manual about installing and upgrading.

SMF 1.0.12 users:  A separate version has been released: 1.0.13. Just like the 1.1.x branch users, you can simply upgrade through the admin center or download and apply the attached patch.

SMF 2.0 beta 3 users: The same goes for members currently running SMF 2.0 beta 3. They can upgrade to SMF 2.0 beta 3.1 through the admin center or by downloading and applying the attached patch.

Finally - please do not use this topic for any support requests. You will get a much more prompt response by visiting the relevant support board!

Thanks,

Simple Machines

It may be a mod issue. I was able to install the patch just fine on my forum which has a lot of mods itself as well ![:)](https://smf-smileys.simplemachinesweb.com/default/smiley.gif "Smiley") But please ask in support forums instead of here.

Open ./Sources/Subs-Package.php and  check whether it says
\* Software Version:           SMF 1.1.3                                           \*
rather than
\* Software Version:           SMF 1.1.2                                           \*
which the package was expecting.

Thats what a friend had on his install with 1.1.5 that I've just had to fix on that exact file.
Although I didn't have to do that on my own.

I'm shocked, I had no need to manually edit any files, even on my heavily modified forum. Best. Upgrade. Ever.

Well I do know that the following mod has to be uninstalled prior to updating to 1.1.5 this is fixed in 1.1.5.
<http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=976>

But the developers do try their best to get around such needs to hopefully work without uninstalling mods or manually applying the patch.

The Simple Machine?s Forum audio Captcha that has been hardened from attack. I have contacted SMF about this flaw and it has been verified.
I go into greater detail of how i am able to break this captcha here:
http://www.rooksecurity.com/blog/?p=6
Exploit Code: http://www.rooksecurity.com/exploits/smf\_captcha.zip
This captcha has been broken before and exploit code is available here: http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/471641 . The fix was to add a randomly generated static.
I was able to write code to decipher the audio file using a Fuzzy Logic comparison http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy\_logic . The comparison is the Hamming Distance http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming\_distance between the original audio file and the damaged one generated by the Captcha.

## Learn How MDR Can Help Your Organization

[Managed detection and response (MDR)](/en-us/products/managed-detection-and-response "Sophos Managed Detection and Response (MDR)") is a fully-managed, 24/7 service delivered by experts who specialize in detecting and responding to cyberattacks that technology solutions alone cannot prevent. By combining human expertise with protection technologies and advanced machine learning models, MDR analysts can detect, investigate, and neutralize advanced human-led attacks, preventing data breaches and ransomware.

The reality is that technology cannot stop every attack. Today’s well-funded adversaries abuse stolen credentials, security misconfigurations, and legitimate IT tools to bypass defense technologies, and they continually innovate and industrialize their approaches. The only way to reliably detect and neutralize determined attackers is with 24×7 eyes-on-glass delivered by security operations professionals. Providing this round-the-clock expert coverage is unrealistic for most organizations on their own and, as a result, companies are increasingly turning to specialist Managed Detection Response (MDR) providers for support.

[### What is MDR?

A fully-managed, 24/7 service delivered by experts who specialize in detecting and responding to cyberattacks.](#card-micro-colorbox-274301)
## What is Managed Detection and Response (MDR)?

MDR is a fully-managed, 24/7 service delivered by cybersecurity experts who specialize in detecting and responding to cyberattacks. By combining human expertise with protection technologies and advanced machine learning models, MDR security analysts can detect, investigate, and neutralize advanced human-led attacks, preventing data breaches and ransomware.

[### Why MDR?

MDR services provide the expertise for you, enabling organizations to expand their security operations capabilities without expanding their headcount.](#card-micro-colorbox-275801)
## What are the Benefits of MDR?

With MDR you benefit from the breadth and depth of experience of the provider’s analysts capabilities. Threat detection and response is time consuming and unpredictable. The urgent nature of the work can prevent teams from focusing on more strategic — and often more interesting — challenges. Working with an MDR service enables you to free up IT capacity to support business-focused initiatives. MDR services provide the expertise for you, enabling organizations to expand their security operations capabilities without expanding their headcount.

[### MDR Benefits

One of the major advantages of using an MDR provider over in-house only security operations programs is elevated protection against ransomware and other advanced cyber threats.](#card-micro-colorbox-304416)
## What are the Benefits of MDR

With MDR you benefit from the breadth and depth of experience of the provider’s analysts. A MDR vendor will experience a far greater volume and variety of attacks than any individual organization, giving them a level of expertise that is almost impossible to replicate in house. Threat detection and response is time consuming and unpredictable. The urgent nature of the work can prevent teams from focusing on more strategic — and often more interesting — challenges. Working with a MDR service enables you to free up IT capacity to support business-focused initiatives. Adversaries are most active at the times when your IT team is least likely to be online, such as evenings, weekends, and holiday periods. By providing 24/7 coverage, MDR services provide considerable reassurance and peace of mind. Threat detection and response is a highly complex operation. MDR services provide the expertise for you, enabling organizations to expand their security operations capabilities without expanding their headcount. Maintaining a 24/7 threat hunting team is expensive. By leveraging economies of scale, MDR services provide a cost-effective way to secure your organization and stretch your cybersecurity budget further.

[### Security Telemetry

Security telemetry is gathered from across the full IT ecosystem: endpoint, firewall, network, cloud, email, and identity solutions to provide a complete view of your security posture.](#card-micro-colorbox-275811)
## What is Security Telemetry?

The more analysts can see, the faster they can respond. Threat intelligence and business context are added to the data to provide a more complete view. Related security events are grouped into clusters for complete and efficient investigation. Highly-trained analysts proactively detect threats that bypass security products. They look for tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly used by cybercriminals and threats that may bypass various security tools. Analysts determine the scope and severity of the threat and identify next steps. Analysts interrupt the attack to prevent it from spreading, while removing the malware and isolating the impacted systems. Analysts perform root cause analysis to fully eliminate the attacker and prevent recurrence.

[### MDR Service Providers

An MDR service provider offers a technology stack covering your endpoints, networks, cloud environments, and other areas of your IT infrastructure. MDR providers detect and remediate cyberthreats 24/7/365 while providing threat intelligence services.](#card-micro-colorbox-304411)
## What Does a MDR Provider Offer?

* 24/7/365 monitoring to help you identify cyberthreats across your IT infrastructure.
* Support from threat hunters, security analysts, and other cybersecurity professionals that can teach you about cyberthreats and help you identify and respond to them.
* Threat investigations that you can use to learn about cyberthreats and cybercriminals' TTPs and find out why and how cyberattacks are happening.
* Threat intelligence that you can use to understand cyberthreats and what can be done to stop them.
* Security reports that you can use to comply with HIPAA, GDPR, and other data security regulations.

[### MDR, EDR, and XDR

MDR is a managed service that blends EDR (endpoint detection and response) and XDR (extended detection and response) capabilities. The service is managed by an MDR provider that detects and remediates cyberthreats.](#card-micro-colorbox-312751)
## MDR vs. EDR vs. XDR: What You Need to Know

MDR is a managed service that blends [EDR](/en-us/products/endpoint-antivirus/edr "EDR security") and XDR capabilities. The service is managed by an MDR provider that looks for cyberthreats across your IT infrastructure. If a threat is found, your MDR provider responds to the threat for you or notifies you about it. In either scenario, your MDR provider keeps you in the loop about cyberthreats and what you can to guard against them.

An EDR service classifies known threats as it identifies them. The service looks for unusual or suspicious activity across your endpoints. It also uses a database that contains threat insights to compare this activity against cyberthreats. If your EDR service identifies a threat, it automatically responds to it for you.

XDR goes beyond EDR, since it looks for threats across your IT infrastructure. An XDR service tracks things like abnormal network traffic and anomalous cloud activity that indicate a cyberattack may be underway. It provides [threat intelligence](https://assets.sophos.com/X24WTUEQ/at/vhfnqbtsg5kxcxhq6kcvt6h/sophos-threat-intelligence-ds.pdf) to help you understand security issues across your IT infrastructure. You can use this threat intelligence to find ways to keep pace with current and emerging cyberthreats and level up your security posture.
