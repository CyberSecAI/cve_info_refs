      "summary": "The Online Fantasy Football League (OFFL) version 0.2.6 and prior versions suffer from multiple insecure MySQL queries leading to SQL Injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the 'teams.php', 'leagues.php', and 'players.php' scripts are vulnerable. An attacker can exploit this to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords. The provided exploit examples demonstrate how to inject SQL code via the 'fflteam_id' parameter in 'teams.php' to retrieve user credentials. Passwords are encrypted in MD5."

      "summary": "Online Fantasy Football League (OFFL) versions 0.2.6 and earlier are vulnerable to remote SQL injection. The vulnerability is due to insecure MySQL queries and can be exploited in 'teams.php', 'leagues.php' and 'players.php'. An attacker can inject SQL code to extract data from the database including username and password. Example exploits are given for 'teams.php' that use UNION SELECT statements to extract user credentials. Passwords are MD5 encrypted. The vulnerability is rated as low risk, remote, with low attack complexity and no authentication required. The CVSS base score is 7.5 with high exploitability and partial confidentiality, integrity and availability impact."
