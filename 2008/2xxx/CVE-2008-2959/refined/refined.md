```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the vb6skit.dll module of Visual Basic Enterprise Edition SP6 due to an overly long string being passed as the lpstrLinkPath parameter to the fCreateShellLink function.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow
- Impact of exploitation:  The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability could allow for arbitrary code execution, although the author states they were unable to write a full exploit due to inebriation.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered when a Visual Basic application calls the `fCreateShellLink` function within `vb6skit.dll` with an excessively long string for the `lpstrLinkPath` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker would need to be able to run a specially crafted Visual Basic application or otherwise trigger the vulnerable function call with a long string.
