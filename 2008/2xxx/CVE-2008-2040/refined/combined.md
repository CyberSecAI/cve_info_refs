# Security Bug Tracker

The data in this tracker comes solely from the bug database maintained
by Debian's security team located in the security-tracker Git [repository](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/tree/master/data). The data represented here is derived from: [DSAs](https://www.debian.org/security/#DSAS) issued by the Security Team; issues tracked in the [CVE database](https://www.cve.org/), issues tracked in the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) (NVD), maintained by NIST; and security issues
discovered in Debian packages as reported in the BTS.

All external data (including Debian bug reports and official Debian
security advisories) must be added to this database before it appears
here. Please help us keep this information up-to-date by [reporting](/tracker/data/report) any discrepancies or change of status that you are
aware of and/or help us improve the quality of this information by [participating](/tracker/data/report).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package: gnome-peercast

Severity: grave

Hi,
I found a security issue in the peercast server which also
affects gnome-peercast. I contacted the upstream author of
peercast 6 days ago without any reply so far.
Here are the details:
From core/common/http.cpp:

105 void HTTP::getAuthUserPass(char *user, char *pass)
106 {
107         if (arg)
108         {
109                 char *s = stristr(arg,"Basic");
110                 if (s)
111                 {
112                         while (*s)
113                                 if (*s++ == ' ')
114                                         break;
115                         String str;
116                         str.set(s,String::T_BASE64);
117                         str.convertTo(String::T_ASCII);
118                         s = strstr(str.cstr(),":");
119                         if (s)
120                         {
121                                 *s = 0;
122                                 if (user)
123                                         strcpy(user,str.cstr());
124                                 if (pass)
125                                         strcpy(pass,s+1);

This function is used if authentication to the gnome-peercast server is done by basic http auth
which is the case in the standard configuration of gnome-peercast.
In line 116 the base64 encoded string is copied into str.
Note the set method is peercasts/gnome-peercasts own implementation of set
since it reimplements the String class. set looks like this:

From core/common/sys.h:
38                 MAX_LEN = 256
...
62         void set(const char *p, TYPE t=T_ASCII)
63         {
64                 strncpy(data,p,MAX_LEN-1);
65                 data[MAX_LEN-1] = 0;
66                 type = t;
67         }

In line 117 the string gets decoded and in line 118 and
following the part before ':' in the decoded string gets copied
into user and the part after it into pass.

From core/common/servhs.cpp:
558 bool Servent::handshakeAuth(HTTP &http,const char *args,bool local)
559 {
560         char user[64],pass[64];
561         user[0] = pass[0] = 0;
...
580     while (http.nextHeader())
581         {
582                 char *arg = http.getArgStr();
583                 if (!arg)
584                         continue;
585
586                 switch (servMgr->authType)
587                 {
588                         case ServMgr::AUTH_HTTPBASIC:
589                                 if (http.isHeader("Authorization"))
590                                         http.getAuthUserPass(user,pass);
591                                 break;

user and pass are only declared to have 64 bytes (line 558) while the buffer used for
copy can store up to MAX_LEN (256) bytes (ok minus the : here). Servent::handshakeAuth calls then
the getAuthUserPass function triggering a buffer overflow.
It's thus possible to crash the server and execute arbitrary code if the server
allows http-basic authentication.

I already requested a CVE id for this.

PoC attached.
Kind regards
Nico

Package        : gnome-peercast
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-6454 CVE-2008-2040
Debian Bug     : 466539

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Gnome PeerCast,
the Gnome interface to PeerCast, a P2P audio and video streaming
server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2007-6454

    Luigi Auriemma discovered that PeerCast is vulnerable to a heap
    overflow in the HTTP server code, which allows remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
    long SOURCE request.

CVE-2008-2040

    Nico Golde discovered that PeerCast, a P2P audio and video streaming
    server, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the HTTP Basic
    Authentication code, allowing a remote attacker to crash PeerCast or
    execure arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.4-1.1etch0.

For the unstable distribution (sid), the first issue has been fixed in
0.5.4-1.2. The second issue will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnome-peercast package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you

# PeerCast: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200807-11**

A buffer overflow vulnerability in PeerCast may allow for the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-sound/peercast** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.1218-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.1218-r1** |

### Background

PeerCast is a client and server for P2P-radio networks.

### Description

Nico Golde reported a boundary error in the HTTP::getAuthUserPass()
function when processing overly long HTTP Basic authentication
requests.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP request to the
vulnerable server, possibly resulting in the remote execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PeerCast users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/peercast-0.1218-r1"
```

I found a security issue in the peercast server in the
HTTP::getAuthUserPass function. I already contacted the upstream author 6 days
ago and didn't get an answer yet so I am publishing this now.

From core/common/http.cpp:

105 void HTTP::getAuthUserPass(char *user, char *pass)
106 {
107         if (arg)
108         {
109                 char *s = stristr(arg,"Basic");
110                 if (s)
111                 {
112                         while (*s)
113                                 if (*s++ == ' ')
114                                         break;
115                         String str;
116                         str.set(s,String::T_BASE64);
117                         str.convertTo(String::T_ASCII);
118                         s = strstr(str.cstr(),":");
119                         if (s)
120                         {
121                                 *s = 0;
122                                 if (user)
123                                         strcpy(user,str.cstr());
124                                 if (pass)
125                                         strcpy(pass,s+1);

This function is used if authentication to the peercast server is done by basic http auth
rather than by a cookie. In line 116 the base64 encoded string is copied into str.
Note the set method is peercasts own implementation of set since it reimplements the String
class. set looks like this:

From core/common/sys.h:
38                 MAX_LEN = 256
...
62         void set(const char *p, TYPE t=T_ASCII)
63         {
64                 strncpy(data,p,MAX_LEN-1);
65                 data[MAX_LEN-1] = 0;
66                 type = t;
67         }

In line 117 the string gets decoded and in line 118 and
following the part before ':' in the decoded string gets copied
into user and the part after it into pass.

From core/common/servhs.cpp:
558 bool Servent::handshakeAuth(HTTP &http,const char *args,bool local)
559 {
560         char user[64],pass[64];
561         user[0] = pass[0] = 0;
...
580     while (http.nextHeader())
581         {
582                 char *arg = http.getArgStr();
583                 if (!arg)
584                         continue;
585
586                 switch (servMgr->authType)
587                 {
588                         case ServMgr::AUTH_HTTPBASIC:
589                                 if (http.isHeader("Authorization"))
590                                         http.getAuthUserPass(user,pass);
591                                 break;

user and pass are only declared to have 64 bytes (line 558) while the buffer used for
copy can store up to MAX_LEN (256) bytes (ok minus the : here). Servent::handshakeAuth calls then
the getAuthUserPass function triggering a buffer overflow.
It's thus possible to crash the server and execute arbitrary code if the server
allows http-basic authentication.

I already requested a CVE id for this.

An example configuration and PoC is attached.

Kind regards
Nico

Hi,
uploading 0-day NMU with maintainers permission.
debdiff attached and also archived on:
[http://people.debian.org/~nion/nmu-diff/peercast-0.1218+svn20080104-1_0.1218+svn20080104-1.1.patch](http://people.debian.org/~nion/nmu-diff/peercast-0.1218%2Bsvn20080104-1_0.1218%2Bsvn20080104-1.1.patch)

Note, looking at the debdiff you will see that
dh_listpackages were added in some log files. I did not do
this, they are added automatically. Should be fixed in the
build system later :)

Kind regards
Nico

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
