  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2008-2040",
    "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the HTTP::getAuthUserPass function (core/common/http.cpp) in Peercast 0.1218 and gnome-peercast allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a Basic Authentication string with a long (1) username or (2) password.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `HTTP::getAuthUserPass` function, where the function copies the base64 decoded username and password from the HTTP Authorization header into fixed-size buffers without proper bounds checking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a long username or password in the Basic Authentication header.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server, and the server must be configured to allow basic HTTP authentication."
