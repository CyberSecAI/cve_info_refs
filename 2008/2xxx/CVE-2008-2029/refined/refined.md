Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-2029, which is related to MiniBB 2.2:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The `$glang` variable, which should be an array, is not properly handled in `bb_func_regusr.php`. When it is empty, a PHP warning is generated that discloses the full server path.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize the `glang` parameter when processing user input in `index.php`. This allows for injecting malicious scripts.
*   **Remote SQL Injection:** The `$xtr` variable in `setup_mysql.php` is not properly sanitized or initialized. With `register_globals` enabled, an attacker can overwrite this variable, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:**  Improper handling of input, leading to information leakage
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of input sanitization, allowing for execution of malicious scripts
*   **SQL Injection:** Insecure handling of user-controlled data in SQL queries, leading to database manipulation.
*   **Reliance on `register_globals`:**  The application's security is compromised when `register_globals` is enabled, which is a deprecated and insecure PHP setting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:**  An attacker can obtain the server's full path, which can be used for further attacks.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the forum, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing other malicious actions in the user's browser.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can read sensitive database information, including user credentials, and potentially modify or delete data. In this specific case, admin credentials can be exposed. `load_file()` can also be used to read sensitive server files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET parameters:** All three vulnerabilities can be triggered through manipulating specific parameters in the URL.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** `index.php?action=registernew&glang=1`
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** `index.php?action=registernew&glang[]=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
*   **SQL Injection:** `index.php?action=userinfo&user=-1&xtr=<SQL Injection Payload>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely through a web browser.
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP and SQL:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to craft malicious URLs and SQL queries.
*   **`register_globals = On`:** For the SQL Injection vulnerability to be exploitable, the server must have the `register_globals` setting turned on, which is insecure.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit-db entry lists three CVEs, CVE-2008-2029, CVE-2008-2028, and CVE-2008-2024. This is because these are related vulnerabilities for the same application miniBB.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in miniBB 2.2a.
*   The miniBB team recommends disabling `register_globals` as a general security practice.
*   The fix for the SQL injection vulnerability involves adding `'xtr'` to the `$unset` array in `index.php`.
