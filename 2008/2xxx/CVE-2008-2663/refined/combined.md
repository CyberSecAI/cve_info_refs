How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Impact: If WEBRick is running, a remote attacker may be able to access files protected by WEBrick's :NondisclosureName option.

Description: The :NondisclosureName option in the Ruby WEBrick toolkit is used to restrict access to files. Requesting a file name which uses unexpected capitalization may bypass the :NondisclosureName restriction. This update addresses the issue by additional validation of file names. Additional information is available via http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2008/03/03/webrick-file-access-vulnerability/. The directory traversal issue described in the advisory does not affect Mac OS X.

Impact: A remote attacker may be able to cause an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.

Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in the handling of SMB packets. Sending malicious SMB packets to a SMB server, or connecting to a malicious SMB server, may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking on the length of received SMB packets. Credit to Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research for reporting this issue.

**System Configuration**

CVE-ID: CVE-2008-2313

Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11

Impact: A local user may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of new users.

Description: A local user may be able to populate the User Template directory with files that will become part of the home directory when a new user is created. This could allow arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the new user. This update addresses the issue by applying more restrictive permissions on the User Template directory. This issue does not affect systems running Mac OS X 10.5 or later. Credit to Andrew Mortensen of the University of Michigan for reporting this issue.

# Ruby: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200812-17**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ruby that allow for
attacks including arbitrary code execution and Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/ruby** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.8.6\_p287-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.8.6\_p287-r1** |

### Background

Ruby is an interpreted object-oriented programming language. The
elaborate standard library includes an HTTP server ("WEBRick") and a
class for XML parsing ("REXML").

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Ruby interpreter
and its standard libraries. Drew Yao of Apple Product Security
discovered the following flaws:

* Arbitrary code execution
  or Denial of Service (memory corruption) in the rb\_str\_buf\_append()
  function (CVE-2008-2662).
* Arbitrary code execution or Denial
  of Service (memory corruption) in the rb\_ary\_stor() function
  (CVE-2008-2663).
* Memory corruption via alloca in the
  rb\_str\_format() function (CVE-2008-2664).
* Memory corruption
  ("REALLOC\_N") in the rb\_ary\_splice() and rb\_ary\_replace() functions
  (CVE-2008-2725).
* Memory corruption ("beg + rlen") in the
  rb\_ary\_splice() and rb\_ary\_replace() functions (CVE-2008-2726).

Furthermore, several other vulnerabilities have been reported:

* Tanaka Akira reported an issue with resolv.rb that enables
  attackers to spoof DNS responses (CVE-2008-1447).
* Akira Tagoh
  of RedHat discovered a Denial of Service (crash) issue in the
  rb\_ary\_fill() function in array.c (CVE-2008-2376).
* Several
  safe level bypass vulnerabilities were discovered and reported by Keita
  Yamaguchi (CVE-2008-3655).
* Christian Neukirchen is credited
  for discovering a Denial of Service (CPU consumption) attack in the
  WEBRick HTTP server (CVE-2008-3656).
* A fault in the dl module
  allowed the circumvention of taintness checks which could possibly lead
  to insecure code execution was reported by "sheepman"
  (CVE-2008-3657).
* Tanaka Akira again found a DNS spoofing
  vulnerability caused by the resolv.rb implementation using poor
  randomness (CVE-2008-3905).
* Luka Treiber and Mitja Kolsek
  (ACROS Security) disclosed a Denial of Service (CPU consumption)
  vulnerability in the REXML module when dealing with recursive entity
  expansion (CVE-2008-3790).

### Impact

These vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code,
spoof DNS responses, bypass Ruby's built-in security and taintness
checks, and cause a Denial of Service via crash or CPU exhaustion.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Ruby users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/ruby-1.8.6_p287-r1"
```

## Details

Drew Yao discovered several vulnerabilities in Ruby which lead to integer

overflows. If a user or automated system were tricked into running a

malicious script, an attacker could cause a denial of service or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2008-2662](/security/CVE-2008-2662), [CVE-2008-2663](/security/CVE-2008-2663), [CVE-2008-2725](/security/CVE-2008-2725), [CVE-2008-2726](/security/CVE-2008-2726))

Drew Yao discovered that Ruby did not sanitize its input when using ALLOCA.

If a user or automated system were tricked into running a malicious script,

an attacker could cause a denial of service via memory corruption.

([CVE-2008-2664](/security/CVE-2008-2664))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- powerdns spoofing problems
The PowerDNS packages were updated to offer better spoofing
resistance by not ignoring invalid queries. (CVE-2008-3337)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.

- neon NULL pointer problem
The helper library neon was updated to fix a NULL pointer dereference
in the digest authentication code. (CVE-2008-3746)
neon was updated on all affected distributions.
- rxvt-unicode session hijacking
Using rxvt-unicode it was possible to open a terminal on :0 when
the environment variable was not set.
This could be exploited by local users to hijack X11 connections (CVE-2008-1142).
rxvt-unicode was updated on openSUSE 10.2-11.0.
- perl multiple problems
Several problems were fixed in the scripting language perl.
Specially crafted regular expressions could crash perl
(CVE-2008-1927).
Insufficient symlink checks in the File::Path could result in wrong
file permissions (CVE-2008-2827).
Additionally problem in the CGI module was fixed that could result
in an endless loop if uploads were canceled.
- Wireshark / ethereal multiple security problems
Various vulnerabilities have been fixed in ethereal and wireshark:
CVE-2008-3137, CVE-2008-3138, CVE-2008-3139,
CVE-2008-3140, CVE-2008-3141, CVE-2008-3145
and CVE-2008-3146. Those could be potentially used to crash
wireshark or potentially execute code.
Updates have been released for all SUSE Linux distributions.
- namazu cross site scripting
The indexing engine namazu was upgraded to fix a UTF-7
cross-site-scripting vulnerability. (CVE-2008-1468)
namazu was updated on all products containing it.
- gnome-screensaver clipboard disclosure
gnome-screensaver was updated to disallows local users to
read the contents of the clipboard for a locked screen using
ctrl-v. (CVE-2007-6389)
Updates have been released for openSUSE 10.3, other distributions
were not affected.
- MySQL security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix a security problem:
CVE-2008-2079: MySQL allowed local users to bypass certain privilege
checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1)
DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within
the MySQL home data directory, which can point to tables that are
created in the future.
CVE-2006-7232: sql\_select.cc in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.32 and 5.1.x
before 5.1.14 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA
table, as originally demonstrated using ORDER BY.
MySQL was updated on all SUSE Linux distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## June 2008 Ruby Security Advisory: A Summary

By [Peter Cooper](http://www.rubyinside.com/author/admin "View all posts by Peter Cooper") / June 22, 2008

![dontpanic.jpg](http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dontpanic.jpg)

*Photo by [JL2003](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brighton/2153602543/) - CC 2.0 Attribution License*

The official Ruby blog is [reporting "multiple vulnerabilities"](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2008/06/20/arbitrary-code-execution-vulnerabilities/) in the official Ruby interpreter (MRI). A significant number of versions are affected:

* All versions *prior* to 1.8.5
* All 1.8.5 versions prior to patch 231
* All 1.8.6 versions prior to patch 230
* All 1.8.7 versions prior to patch 22
* All 1.9.0 versions prior to 1.9.0-2

Jeremy Kemper, at the official *Rails* blog, advised upgrading immediately, but with the warning that Ruby 1.8.7 only works with Rails 2.1 and later. Numerous commenters, however, have noted significant issues with Rails applications once they've upgraded to Ruby 1.8.6p230 and 1.8.5p231. A poster on RubyFlow [suggests](http://www.rubyflow.com/items/538) Ruby 1.8.6-p230 is not compatible with Rails at all, although others have reported success.

**What are the problems?**

\*\*\* \*\*\*\* has [put together a pretty detailed look at what the actual defects are](http://www.*******.com/rants/the_big_ruby_vulnerabilities.html) (mostly "general buffer overflow defects, signed integer problems, and path traversal problems").

Eric Monti has posted [code examples to demonstrate some issues](http://www.matasano.com/log/1070/updates-on-drew-yaos-terrible-ruby-vulnerabilities/).

**Is it urgent?**

It appears that while this is a significant security advisory, and you should be paying attention, **there's no 0-day urgency on this** as [Eric Wong highlights](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/6/21/multiple-ruby-security-vulnerabilities#comment-20967). **Walk, but don't run, to the exit. Eric Monti, on the other hand, seems to be [quite worried](http://www.matasano.com/log/1070/updates-on-drew-yaos-terrible-ruby-vulnerabilities/) by the security vulnerabilities.**

If you're only running your own scripts on your own local machine (that is, not a public-facing Web app), you *might* be better off waiting for your operating system's packaging system to update Ruby for you (whether on Linux or OS X). The security issues were discovered by Drew Yao of Apple who has suggested a OS X update for this will be going out soon, so it's reasonable to wait for that if you're on OS X.

My ***personal*** advice (which is, [as noted](http://www.rubyinside.com/june-2008-ruby-security-vulnerabilities-927.html#comment-36449) by Thomas H. Ptacek, "*spectacularly bad*") is that unless you're already itching to upgrade out of panic, just make sure you're familiar with where all your Ruby deployments are, what versions they're running now, and that you have a good idea of how to upgrade them. Then unless you're confident about upgrading and running tests straight away, I'd wait until a lot more positive noises are coming out of Rails developers upgrading to the latest versions, especially surrounding Ruby 1.8.6p230.

Quite why anyone would have code that relies on *any* unchecked / unsanitized data is beyond me, but it's worth keeping in mind if you do. So, panic if you want, but even if you don't, you'll probably still be alive and this news will be forgotten within a week or two.

   The "walk don't run" sentiment is dead wrong. You do not need to handle multi-gigabyte strings to trip these vulnerabilities; you just need code that can be coerced into using broken indices. It's spectacularly bad advice to suggest that people should continue to run code with known memory corruption vulnerabilities.

   Peter --- Ruby devs don't check integer indices because Ruby is an EAFP language (ask forgiveness, not permission) --- it throws exceptions or returns "nil" when you get things like array indexes wrong. Lots of Ruby code is written to handle errors, instead of checking for them.

   You really don't want to be in a position of vouching for every dependent line of code in your project to get this right to ensure that someone can't run native code on your servers. It would be a hard thing to explain to your users, your customers, or your PCI auditors.

   It's not necessarily a case of checking the indices, but more that you shouldn't allow unsanitized data to have any direct effect on low level (as low level as Ruby gets anyway) operations within code (unless you're running within some sort of sandbox, in which case the advisory would be even less significant).

   Of course, a database entry (assuming it was put there by a third party or you weren't using validations), an erroneous response from a search/indexing library, or the like, /could/ trigger large string indices like this, so there are no hard and fast rules and if you're in a big budget production environment, upgrading is clearly a good idea.

   If you were using fuzz testing (or even good unit testing) on your application, this particular part of the advisory would almost be a non issue since such you'd already be familiar with what your application does when given such crazy data.

   Doubt that fuzz testing will catch these. For instance, to trip the Bignum integer overflow, you need an integer whose backing store is many hundreds of megabytes long.

   Without giving a definitive answer, on the array index issue in particular, it doesn't appear so. I get a "ArgumentError: index too big" exception, rather than either a hang (as I get on my older Ruby 1.8.6) or a segfault (as some users are getting).

   My suggestion that Ruby 1.8.6-p230 is incompatible with Rails was based only on the comments in Jeremy's post (including his own). I haven't upgraded or done any testing of my own as of yet to confirm this. My posting on RubyFlow should have explained this, sorry about that.

    The varying results seem to indicate that perhaps a certain plugin or specific technique used by some Rails developers can cause issues on p230, but not Rails per-se (unless it's a version specific issue). Still worth keeping in mind though.

    It is pretty lame IMHO that the ruby core developers pushed out this 'security' patch that also includes breaking feature changes in a minor patch level release. This puts folks between a rock and a hard place. Either you risk it and keep running the old version, or you upgrade to p230 and break your apps with segfaults. Neither of these is a fun option. Where is the patch for 1.8.6p114 that \*only\* fixes the security bugs?

    I did a brand new Rails 2.1 scaffold and Ruby 1.8.6 patch 230 broke at the first page i tried to load. There was no specific plugin to speak of. Maybe it's an incompatibility with the operating system (Debian Etch?) or the way i linked the dependencies ...?

    To be completely honest, I don't see much of a choice in this issue, and being paranoid about it is being too anal for your own good. It sucks for sure to know that evil hacker people have an easy and well documented shot at bringing your applications to their knees, but what is the alternative?

    No matter what you do, chances are it will end in misery and segfaults. If you don't upgrade, it might if you're unlucky and get attacked - and if you do upgrade, it probably will.

    Another thing is that it seems that the Phusion guys [already managed to integrate 1.8.6p230](http://blog.phusion.nl/2008/06/22/ruby-enterprise-edition-186-20080621-released/) into Ruby Enterprise Edition. One must assume that it works with Rails (although there is one report of segfaults with Rails 1.2.6), but they haven't published anything official about which version(s) it supports.

    There's a thread on ruby-talk for this topic, which may be a better place to discuss this: <http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/157034>

    Here's a copy of my post from that thread regarding this topic:

    All versions of MRI Ruby that claim to fix the vulnerabilities are either failing with segmentation faults or change the API in ways that make it impossible to run vital libraries such as Rails 2.0.x and RSpec. These broken versions include: 1.8.5p231, 1.8.6p230, 1.8.7p22, and 1.9.0-2. Unfortunately, the source code describing some of the proposed fixes has been publicly available now for four days for crackers to write their attacks, so we're in a race with the bad guys to deliver a solution.

    Is anyone working on fixing these bugs? If not, can we rally the community to get a bounty and/or code sprint going?

    Is there a way to convince the Ruby maintainers to run new code against the publicly-available test suites provided by RubySpec, Rails and Rspec before they ship a new version to avoid these problems in the future?

    Is there anything else that those of us which lack the necessary C expertise to fix these problems can do to help with this effort?

    Thank you.
