    {
      "cve": "CVE-2008-2975",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `language` and `prefix` parameters. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to include local files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
        "Lack of input sanitization"

       "impact": "Successful exploitation of the LFI vulnerability can lead to system access, allowing an attacker to read sensitive files from the server.  This can result in sensitive information disclosure and potential system compromise.",
       "attack_vectors": "HTTP GET requests with manipulated `language` or `prefix` parameters in vulnerable PHP files. Examples include:\n\n`http://localhost/path/include_me.php?language=[LFI]`\n`http://localhost/path/admin/ajax.php?language=[LFI]`\n`http://localhost/path/admin/inc/config.php?prefix=[LFI]`\n`http://localhost/path/admin/objects/catalog.ajaxhandler.php?language=[LFI]`",

This could result in the compromise of user accounts, session hijacking, or other malicious actions executed within the context of the victim's browser.",
