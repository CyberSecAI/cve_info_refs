Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-2684:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `BIDIB.ocx` ActiveX control of the Black Ice Software Inc Barcode SDK.
- The `DownloadImageFileURL` method within the control is susceptible to both arbitrary file download and memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Download:** The `DownloadImageFileURL` method allows an attacker to specify a URL from which to download a file and a local path where to save it. This bypasses security restrictions that prevent arbitrary file downloads.
2.  **Memory Corruption:** By providing excessively long strings as arguments to the `DownloadImageFileURL` method, specifically in the source and destination parameters, it triggers memory corruption. This is likely due to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Download:**
    -   An attacker can download and execute malicious files onto a user's system without the user's consent or knowledge.
    -   This enables the attacker to compromise the system by installing malware, spyware, or other harmful software.
2.  **Memory Corruption:**
    -   Memory corruption can lead to application crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited further, allowing an attacker to gain full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Web-based Attacks:** The exploit leverages Internet Explorer via VBScript, suggesting the vulnerability is triggered through a malicious webpage containing embedded ActiveX controls, making it a remote attack.
-   **Social Engineering:** Attackers could potentially deliver the exploit through phishing emails or drive-by download attacks by directing users to a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote Position:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through a website or HTML email containing the malicious ActiveX control.
-   **User Interaction:** The user needs to visit a website or open an HTML email containing the malicious control. In the exploit sample, the user needs to click a button, however a similar exploit can likely be crafted to automatically trigger the vulnerable code.
-   **Vulnerable Software:** The targeted machine must have the vulnerable `BIDIB.ocx` ActiveX control installed.
-   **Vulnerable Browser:** The user must be using a vulnerable browser such as Internet Explorer 6 or 7 to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**

-   The provided exploit code shows how to trigger both the arbitrary file download and memory corruption vulnerabilities using VBScript and the `DownloadImageFileURL` method.
-   The CLSID of the vulnerable ActiveX control is `{D2797899-BE27-4CDB-892F-4FDC26EA9BA9}`.
-   The exploit code explicitly shows how to overwrite memory using a buffer overflow by providing 2068 characters for the source and destination path.
-   The tested environments include Windows XP Professional SP3 with Internet Explorer 7, and Windows 2000 Professional SP3 with Internet Explorer 6.
