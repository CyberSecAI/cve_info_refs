# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-054 - Critical

## Vulnerability in Windows Media Player Could Allow Remote Code Execution (954154)

Published: September 09, 2008 | Updated: September 15, 2008

**Version:** 2.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Windows Media Player that could allow remote code execution when a specially crafted audio file is streamed from a Windows Media server. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported and affected editions of Windows Media Player 11. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which Windows Media Player 11 handles audio files streamed from a server-side playlist (SSPL). For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.**  Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

**Known Issues.** None

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

**\*Windows Server 2008 server core installation not affected.** The vulnerability addressed by this update does not affect supported editions of Windows Server 2008 if Windows Server 2008 was installed using the Server Core installation option, even though the files affected by this vulnerability may be present on the system. However, users with the affected files will still be offered this update because the update files are newer (with higher version numbers) than the files that are currently on your system. For more information on this installation option, see [Server Core](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms723891%28vs.85%29.aspx). Note that the Server Core installation option does not apply to certain editions of Windows Server 2008; see [Compare Server Core Installation Options](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/compare-core-installation.aspx).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on September 15, 2008?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to communicate the re-release of the Norwegian language update for Windows Media Player 11 on all supported 32-bit editions of Windows XP to fix a quality issue that would cause the installation to fail. Customers who have downloaded and attempted to install the Norwegian language update need to download and install the re-released update to be protected from the vulnerability described in this bulletin. No other updates or locales are affected by this re-release. Also, Microsoft removed an erroneous reference to Windows Media Player 10 as a component of Windows Vista x64 Edition and Windows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 1 from the Non-Affected software table, because this is not a supported configuration.

**Where are the file information details?**

The file information details can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 954154](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/954154).

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Media Player 11. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted audio file that could allow remote code execution when streamed from a Windows Media server using Windows Media Player 11. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-2253](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2253).

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Media Player Sampling Rate Vulnerability - CVE-2008-2253

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Windows Media Player Sampling Rate Vulnerability - CVE-2008-2253

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Unregister wmpeffects.dll**

  To unregister this DLL, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:
  + **For 32-bit Windows-based systems:**

    Regsvr32.exe -u %WINDIR%\system32\wmpeffects.dll
  + **For 64-bit Windows-based systems:**

    Regsvr32.exe -u %WINDIR%\syswow64\wmpeffects.dll
  + **Impact of workaround:** Visualizations will fail to display in the Now Playing view of Windows Media Player.
  + **How to undo the workaround:** Run the following command from an elevated command prompt:
    - **For 32-bit Windows-based systems:**

      Regsvr32.exe %WINDIR%\system32\wmpeffects.dll

      Regsvr32.exe %WINDIR%\syswow64\wmpeffects.dll

#### FAQ for Windows Media Player Sampling Rate Vulnerability - CVE-2008-2253

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Windows Media Player 11 incorrectly handles specially crafted audio-only files streamed from a Windows Media Server in a server-side playlist (SSPL).

**What is a server-side playlist (SSPL)?**

A SSPL is a list that identifies what content is played for a client, the time at which it is played, and the order in which it is played. The SSPL for a Windows Media server is an XML document. For more information about SSPL, see [Server-Side Playlists](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms753585%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted audio file from a Windows Media Server.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Windows Media Server that contains a specially crafted audio file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Any system using Windows Media Player, such as workstations or terminal servers, is at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which Windows Media Player 11 handles audio files streamed from a SSPL.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.
