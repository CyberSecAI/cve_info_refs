  "CVE-2008-2251": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists due to a possible \"Double Free\" condition in the Windows kernel.",
    "details": "The vulnerability is caused by the Windows kernel not properly handling certain system calls from multiple threads, potentially leading to a 'double free' condition. This allows an attacker to run code with elevated privileges. Specifically, the system may attempt to release or \"free\" memory multiple times, which can corrupt memory and allow execution of arbitrary code at the system level.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Double free condition",
      "Improper handling of system calls from multiple threads"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, take complete control of an affected system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access required",
      "Execution of specially crafted application"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to a vulnerable system.",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. Typically, this vulnerability will cause a denial of service to occur. However, in some circumstances, code execution could occur. Because of the unique layout of the memory on each affected system, exploiting this vulnerability on a mass scale could be difficult."
