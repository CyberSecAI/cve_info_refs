Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `post_id` parameter of the Archangel Weblog application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`post_id`), allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, password hashes, and potentially other confidential data.
- **Account Compromise:** The attacker can use the extracted credentials to gain unauthorized access to the application's administrative functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `post_id` parameter of the HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No authentication or prior access is required. The exploit can be launched remotely.
- Basic understanding of SQL syntax is needed to craft malicious queries.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Perl script demonstrates the attack, injecting SQL code using the `union select` statement to extract the username and password hash from the `authors` table.
- The exploit targets the `index.php?post_id=` parameter, injecting the following SQL:
`-1'/**/union/**/select/**/12,concat(CHAR(60,117,115,101,114,62),".$user.",CHAR(60,117,115,101,114,62),".$pass."),32,4,5,6,3/**/from/**/".$tab."/**/where/**/author_id=1/*`
- The script extracts the username and the password hash if the attack is successful and prints them to the console.
