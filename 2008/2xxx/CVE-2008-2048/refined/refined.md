Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2048:

**Summary:**

The provided content indicates that CVE-2008-2048 is related to multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Angelo-Emlak v1.0, an ASP-based web application.  It also notes the presence of an XSS vulnerability in the admin panel.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in several ASP pages (profil.asp, prodetail.asp). This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Multiple SQL injection flaws exist, primarily through the `id` parameter in `profil.asp` and `prodetail.asp`.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `sayfa` parameter in `admin/Default.asp` is vulnerable to XSS.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**
        *   Retrieval of sensitive data, like usernames and passwords from the `admin` table. The exploit examples show how an attacker can use `UNION SELECT` statements to extract this information.
        *   Potential for further database manipulation, although the provided exploit focuses on data retrieval.
    *   **XSS:**
        *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable page.
        *   Potential for session hijacking, cookie theft, and redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** HTTP GET requests to vulnerable ASP pages (`profil.asp`, `prodetail.asp`), with malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter.
    *   **XSS:** HTTP GET request to the admin panel (`admin/Default.asp`) with malicious JavaScript code in the `sayfa` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. This can be done remotely.
    *   Basic knowledge of SQL injection and XSS techniques.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploits demonstrate how to leverage SQL injection using `UNION SELECT` statements to extract database information.
*   XSS is triggered by injecting a `<script>` tag into the `sayfa` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit database entry also includes URLs for the vulnerable script, the location of the admin panel, and the X13 DB Editor admin panel.
