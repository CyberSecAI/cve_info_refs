  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-2302",
      "details": "The Django administration application, when accessed by an unauthenticated user, displayed a login form. The form's 'action' attribute was generated from the current request path without proper escaping, allowing for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. By crafting a URL with encoded HTML and/or JavaScript in the request path, an attacker could inject malicious code into the login form.",
      "affected_versions": [
        "Django development trunk",
        "Django 0.96",
        "Django 0.95",
        "Django 0.91"
      ],
        "root_cause": "The Django admin login form's 'action' attribute was not properly escaped when generating the URL from the request path.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the login form, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions if a victim visits a crafted link.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious code in the request path.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create and distribute a crafted URL. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
