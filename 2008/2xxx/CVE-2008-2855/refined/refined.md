{
  "CVE-2008-2855": {
    "Root cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `clanek.php` file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
       "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands. In the provided example, the attacker uses `load_file()` to read the content of arbitrary files on the server. Additionally, the XSS vulnerability can lead to arbitrary script execution in the victim's browser.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through HTTP requests by manipulating the `id` parameter within the `clanek.php` file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, and the `magic_quotes_gpc` setting needs to be off for the SQL Injection to work.",
    "Additional details": "The provided exploit details how to use the SQL injection vulnerability to read sensitive files from the server, including a configuration file that might contain database credentials. It also details an XSS vulnerability in the same file."
