Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-2691:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `read.asp` script of JiRo's FAQ Manager eXperience version 1.0. This vulnerability arises because the application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input (`fID` parameter) before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. The exploit examples show how to retrieve the database version.
*  **Data Manipulation:** Depending on the database permissions, an attacker may be able to modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out through a crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the `fID` parameter in the URL `read.asp?fID=`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote and does not require prior authentication or access to the server's file system.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL to craft the malicious queries to be injected.

**Additional details:**
*   The exploit-db entry provides example SQL injection payloads for both MS SQL Server and MS Access databases, indicating the vulnerability can be exploited against different database systems.
*   The content indicates the vulnerable software is "JiRo's FAQ Manager eXperience v 1.0".
*   The exploit was published on milw0rm.com on 2008-06-08.
*   A dork is provided: `inurl:"read.asp?fID="` to help identify potentially vulnerable sites.
