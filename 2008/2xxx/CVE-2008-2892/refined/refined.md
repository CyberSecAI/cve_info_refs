Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2892:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the 'com_expshop' component of Joomla!.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `catid` parameter in the `show_payment` page is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the vulnerable parameter. This allows them to:
    *   Retrieve sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials (usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table, as shown in the example).
    *   Potentially modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain full control over the underlying database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable Joomla! component.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `catid` parameter within the URL is the entry point for the attack.
*   **URL:** Example malicious URL:  `http://localhost/[Joomla_Path]/index.php?option=com_expshop&page=show_payment&catid=-2 UNION SELECT @@version,@@version,concat(username,0x3a,password) FROM jos_users--`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server running the vulnerable Joomla! instance.
*   **No Authentication:** No prior authentication or user privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability, the attack can be carried out directly via the web URL.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:**  The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL to craft the injection payload.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** Attacker needs to know the existence of the component and vulnerable URL parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided exploit details a specific attack, extracting usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table. This demonstrates the severe nature of the vulnerability, showing how user data can be exposed.
* The exploit suggests that other SQL commands could be injected.
