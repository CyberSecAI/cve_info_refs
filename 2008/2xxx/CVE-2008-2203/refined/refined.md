**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.
    *   **XSS:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on web pages.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Vulnerable to SQL injection via the `keywords` parameter in the `search.php` script.
    *   **XSS:**  Vulnerable to reflected XSS via several parameters (`header`, `header2` to `header9`) in the `admin/inc/header.php` file.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete data in the database by injecting malicious SQL code.
    *   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the admin pages, which could be used to steal admin session cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the logged-in admin user. The content specifically mentions that an attacker "Can Get Admin Session With This Vuln".
*   **Attack Vectors:**
