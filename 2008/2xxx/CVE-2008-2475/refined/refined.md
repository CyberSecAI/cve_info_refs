The provided content is related to CVE-2008-2475.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The eBay Enhanced Picture Uploader ActiveX control (EPUWALcontrol.dll) improperly handles specially crafted `PictureUrls` properties or initialization parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The ActiveX control does not properly sanitize or validate the input received through the `PictureUrls` property or initialization parameters, allowing for arbitrary command execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page, an HTML email message, or attachment), an attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTML document containing the vulnerable ActiveX control with a specially crafted `PictureUrls` property or initialization parameter. This document can then be delivered to the victim through a web page, HTML email message, or attachment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious HTML document to a user who has the vulnerable eBay Enhanced Picture Uploader ActiveX control installed and uses Internet Explorer.
