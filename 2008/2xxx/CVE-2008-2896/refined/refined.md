```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application's `index.php` script directly includes files based on user-supplied input from the `page` parameter without proper sanitization or validation, leading to Local File Inclusion.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application uses `strip_tags()` to sanitize user input, which is insufficient to prevent path traversal.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server that the web server process has access to, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.
- Attack vectors: By manipulating the `page` parameter in the URL, an attacker can specify a file path outside the intended directory.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
