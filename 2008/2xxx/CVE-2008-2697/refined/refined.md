Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `recipe_id` parameter of the Joomla! Rapid Recipe component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `recipe_id` parameter before using it in a SQL query, which allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database including user credentials stored in `jos_users` table.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Potential for further attacks:** Successful SQL injection can lead to further compromise of the system, including remote command execution if database user has the privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` script with a malicious SQL query in the `recipe_id` parameter.
    - Example: `http://localhost/[Joomla_Path]/index.php?option=com_rapidrecipe&page=viewrecipe&recipe_id=-1 UNION SELECT user(),concat(username,0x3a,password),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user(),user() FROM jos_users--`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! installation.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is present in a publicly accessible part of the component, so no prior authentication is needed.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**

- **Affected Component:** Joomla! Rapid Recipe component versions 1.6.6 and 1.6.7
- **Dork:** `inurl:com_rapidrecipe "recipe_id"` can be used to find vulnerable sites.
- **Proof of Concept (POC):** The provided POC demonstrates how to use a UNION SELECT statement to extract the usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table.
