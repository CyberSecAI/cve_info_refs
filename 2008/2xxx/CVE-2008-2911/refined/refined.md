Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2911

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Contenido 4.8.4 CMS has multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization in several PHP files, allowing for Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** Several PHP files within the Contenido CMS do not properly sanitize the `contenido_path`, `cfg[path][contenido]`, and `cfg[path][templates]` parameters. This allows an attacker to include a remote file from a location they control, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `contenido` parameter in `index.php` is vulnerable to XSS. Additionally, other parameters like "Belang" and "username" are also vulnerable to XSS through POST requests.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **RFI:** Successful exploitation of RFI can lead to complete compromise of the server, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to data theft, defacement, or further malicious activity.
    *   **XSS:** Successful exploitation of XSS could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **RFI:** By manipulating the vulnerable URL parameters (`contenido_path`, `cfg[path][contenido]`, and `cfg[path][templates]`) with a URL pointing to a malicious file. The attack is performed via HTTP GET requests by injecting crafted URLs.
    *   **XSS:** By injecting malicious script into vulnerable parameters of HTTP requests, either GET or POST (index.php, "Belang" and "username").
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   For RFI, the attacker requires a web server to host the malicious file that will be included by the vulnerable application. For XSS, the attacker needs to craft a malicious script, and have it executed via the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db content provides a list of vulnerable files and example exploit URLs for the RFI vulnerability.
*   The XSS vulnerability is also mentioned along with the vulnerable parameters.
*   The vulnerable software is Contenido version 4.8.4.
