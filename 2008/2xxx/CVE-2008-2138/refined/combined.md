Affected Software/Device: Oracle Application Server Portal
Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass
Tested Version: 10G
Risk: Medium
Description:
Oracle Application Server Portal (OracleAS Portal) is a Web-based
application for building and deploying portals. It provides a secure,
manageable environment for accessing and interacting with enterprise
software services and information resources.
Initially /dav\_portal/portal/ directory is being protected using basic
authentication. It is possible to bypass and access content of
dav\_portal by adding a specially crafted cookie value in the http
request header.
Sample Request:
In order to construct a special http request first visit
"http:/site/pls/portal/%0A" url. This request adds special session id
into cookie. Subsequent connection attempts to
"http://site/dav\_portal/portal/" will reveal the contents of directory
without any authentication.
