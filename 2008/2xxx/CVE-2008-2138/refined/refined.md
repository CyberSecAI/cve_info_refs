Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2138:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Oracle Application Server Portal handles basic authentication for the `/dav_portal/portal/` directory. It is possible to bypass this authentication by manipulating the HTTP request header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the basic authentication mechanism intended to protect the `/dav_portal/portal/` directory.
- **Cookie Manipulation:**  A specially crafted cookie value added to the HTTP request header allows unauthorized access to the directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access the contents of the `/dav_portal/portal/` directory without providing valid credentials.
- **Confidentiality Impact:** Partial confidentiality impact as the attacker can view content that should be protected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves crafting a specific HTTP request with a manipulated cookie.
- **Initial Request:** The attacker must first visit `http://site/pls/portal/%0A` to add a special session ID into the cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability bypasses the need for authentication.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be capable of crafting HTTP requests with specific headers and cookie values.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Oracle Application Server Portal.
- The tested version was 10G.
- The provided description includes a sample request process: first, an attacker must access `http:/site/pls/portal/%0A`, then a request to `http://site/dav_portal/portal/` will bypass authentication.
