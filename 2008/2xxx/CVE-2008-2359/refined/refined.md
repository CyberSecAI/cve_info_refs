Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-2359:

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect configuration of consolehelper files for `system-config-network` in Fedora 8. The configuration files lacked the `USER=root` directive. Additionally, they attempted to include a file (`config-util`) that did not exist in Fedora 8, but was available in the `usermode` package in Fedora 9.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  **Incorrect Permissions Handling:** Due to the missing `USER=root` specification, `consolehelper` prompted for the user's password instead of the root password. This allowed unprivileged users to gain root access to `system-config-network`.
-  **Missing Dependency/Incorrect Configuration:** The attempt to include a non-existent file (`config-util`) further contributed to the problem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  **Unauthorized Network Configuration Changes:** Any local console user could launch the `system-config-network` configuration program with root privileges by providing their own user password, enabling them to modify the host's network configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  **Local Console Access:** An attacker needs physical or direct console access to the machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a user account on the affected Fedora 8 system and have physical or direct console access.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was specific to Fedora 8 and did not affect other Fedora versions, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, or earlier versions of RHEL.
- The issue was addressed by updating the `system-config-network` package in Fedora 8.
