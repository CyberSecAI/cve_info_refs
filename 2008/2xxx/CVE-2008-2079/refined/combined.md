# USN-671-1: MySQL vulnerabilities

17 November 2008

MySQL vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [mysql-dfsg-5.0](/security/cves?package=mysql-dfsg-5.0) -

## Details

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table

files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use the

DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly bypass privilege

checks. This update alters table creation behaviour by disallowing the

use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY

options. ([CVE-2008-2079](/security/CVE-2008-2079), [CVE-2008-4097](/security/CVE-2008-4097) and [CVE-2008-4098](/security/CVE-2008-4098))

It was discovered that MySQL did not handle empty bit-string literals

properly. An attacker could exploit this problem and cause the MySQL

server to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3963](/security/CVE-2008-3963))

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.45-1ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.45-1ubuntu3.4)

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06.11](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06.11)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Description:
When one creates a MyISAM table with

   CREATE TABLE ( ) DATA DIRECTORY ... INDEX DIRECTORY ...

there're special checks to ensure that existing tables are not overwritten via symlinks. That is, one cannot create a 'user' table in the 'test' db, with DATA DIRECTORY pointing to 'mysql' db.

When one creates a table without symlinks, existing files are overwritten. It is intentional too.

But it creates a problem similar to "insecure tempfile creation" - an attacker can create a table with MYD/MYI files in another database, and if another user will later create a table in that database with the same name, the attacker will be able to access the table bypassing privilege checks.

How to repeat:
root> grant all privileges on test.* to test@localhost;

test> create table t1 (a int) data directory '/MySQL/var/mysql', index directory '/MySQL/var/mysql';

root> flush tables;
root> create table t1 (a int);
root> insert t1 values (1),(2),(3);
root> flush tables;

test> select * from t1;

Suggested fix:
don't allow symlinks into datadir

Documented bugfix in the 4.1.24, 5.0.60, 5.1.24, and 6.0.5 changelogs as follows:

        It was possible to circumvent privileges through the creation of
        MyISAM tables employing the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY
        options to overwrite existing table files in the MySQL data
        directory. Use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and
        INDEX DIRECTORY is now disallowed.

In addition, the changelog entries for 5.1.24 and 6.0.5 includes the statement:

                                           This is also true for partitioned

At least some of the patches attached to this bug do not appear to be sufficient to address the vulnerability.  Commit#38278 and #38623 call fn_format() with MY_RETURN_REAL_PATH but not MY_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS; this will cause my_realpath (as it appears in 5.0.51b) to rely entirely on an lstat() check to determine whether the given target is a symlink.  This is insufficient because an attacker can supply the path to a real directory underneath a symlink (e.g. /tmp/{foo -> /var/lib}/mysql) without triggering a simple lstat().

Commit #38680 and #38704 are even worse, in that besides the above problem, they then discard the output of fn_format() entirely, reusing the original input for comparison against the mysql data homedir.

Commit #38932, #38937, #38952, #39513, #40134, #41636, #43143 and #43206 are a mix of these -- they pass MY_RETURN_REAL_PATH to fn_format(), but then ignore its output.

Note that my reading of these patches is based on 5.0.51b and 5.0.32's implementations of fn_format() as a reference; I've tested that backports of #38680/38704 to these versions do not correct the vulnerability, but am only doing a visual reading of the others.
```

Also, the check is not sufficient. test_if_data_home_dir() should be called every time the table is opened, not only when it's created.

After a discussion with other members of the Debian security team, I wanted to pass on a request that you consider a non-path based solution to this issue, at least on operating systems where one is feasible.

There are two basic problems with the path-based fix to this bug employed thus far.  First and most simply, it only works to protect database users who store their data/index files under the mysql data root (whether by deliberate act or by default).  Users who store a table's files outside that path (e.g. to manage disk resources) are still vulnerable to attack.

Secondly, on many operating systems paths aren't a reliable mapping to files.  Linux, for example, supplies bind mounts, where a subset of one filesystem can be made to appear in another location.  There is no symlinking, and a realpath() called on a file in a bind mount will not return the path from the "source" filesystem.  The unionfs feature in FreeBSD, Linux and Plan9 present the same problem, and MacOS' recently-added directory hardlinks probably do as well.  Most of these cases require sysadmin/DBA intervention to bring about the preconditions for the attack, but while unusual are hardly unprecedented.

Under most conditions, the proper fix would be to create new files with O_CREAT|O_EXCL and not try to control path usage.  However, in mysql's particular case this turns an authorization check bypass weakness into a DoS weakness -- though it might be the only viable option for supporting arbitrary user-supplied paths outside the mysql data directory.  For protection within the data directory, you might consider doing inode-based checks based on device+inode number, which are stable at least across bind mounts.  Or you could make passing DATA/INDEX DIRECTORY clauses to CREATE TABLE statements a privileged operation in itself.
```

[14 Jul 2008 11:13]
Sergei Golubchik
```
There's an option to create new files with O_CREAT|O_EXCL. See mysqld --help for keep_files_on_create.

I'm not sure I understand your device+inode idea - does it mean the server would need to scan all databases in the datadir to know all inode numbers of all tables ?
```

[14 Jul 2008 12:57]
Christian Hammers

Hello Sergey

I guess this would indeed mean that MySQL would have to do a stat() call for every directory. Something like:
"find /var/lib/mysql -type d -printf "%D %i %p\n"

bye,

-christian-
```

[17 Jul 2008 5:35]
Devin Carraway
```
If you're trying to protect the mysql data directory and its descendants, then you can do so with a stat() call on that directory, then on each component of the user-supplied index/data directory path (hence for /tmp/foo/bar: /tmp, /tmp/foo, /tmp/foo/bar).  If any of the supplied path's ancestors or the path itself match the mysql data dir, then the user has supplied a path in or under it.  This would not protect databases with data/index dirs outside the mysql root -- for that you'd have to check for a nonempty intersection between the inodes of the components of the user-supplied path and those of each data/index dir used by every other database within that mysqld.

There are a number of potential race conditions in such a check, though they apply equally to a path-based readlink() or realpath() check as well.  Essentially, if mysqld creates the table's data files under a user-controlled path after checking for its validity, then you're not guaranteed that the path used for the create is the same one you checked.  For an attacker trying to exploit the race condition, the odds aren't too shabby, and they can retry as many times as they like until they succeed.

Since there isn't an atomic stat-directory-and-open-file-therein system call in UNIX, to avoid the race may require an ownership-based lstat() check as well, to assure that there aren't any components of the path writable by users other than mysqld's own and root.  And the operation might need to be performed under a global lock so as to protect against races with table storage paths as well.  It sucks, but it might be the price of admission for a feature like this one.
```

[17 Jul 2008 7:33]
Sergei Golubchik
```
So far we're still implementing readlink/realpath solution.

For a bind mounts, for example, we say that it's DBA problem - in particular, if he has made two different paths /a/b/c/d and /e/f/g/h to refer to the same file, he himself needs to make sure that one of these paths is unreadable for mysql user (user, mysqld is running as), e.g. set permissions on c/ directory appropriately.

A simple solution to fix races is to check a path with a realpath, and then use the *expanded* , "real" path to access a file, not the original one.

      test_if_data_home_dir fixed to look into real path.
      Checks added to mi_open for symlinks into data home directory.
```

[18 Jul 2008 7:43]
Devin Carraway
```
Sorry I didn't get to this earlier, but using realpath()'s return value won't work either if the attacker controls any of the components of the (real) path.  Here's a PoC illustrating why, using a mysqld patched to use a realpath() call.  At the time the test_if_data_home_dir() check is run, the path given involves no symlinks at all and does not refer to the mysql data dir.  But by the time the table's files are actually created, the path now includes a symlink to another database's data directory, and the files end up there.

Starting conditions were two empty databases, test1 and test2, with a user allowed to create in t1 but not in t2, and a root user that can create in t2.

First, as the test user:

[etch-amd64] aqua@kesha:/tmp
$ rm -rf directory && umask 0 && mkdir directory && ls -ld directory
drwxrwxrwx 2 aqua 1000 1024 Jul 18 07:17 directory
[etch-amd64] aqua@kesha:/tmp
$ mysql -p test1
Enter password:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 6
Server version: 5.0.32-Debian_7etch6-log Debian etch distribution

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> create table t1 (a int) data directory '/tmp/directory/' index directory '/tmp/directory/' ;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)

mysql>
[1]+  Stopped                 mysql -p test1
[etch-amd64] aqua@kesha:/tmp
$ mysql -p test1
[etch-amd64] aqua@kesha:/tmp
$ rm -rf directory && ln -s /var/lib/mysql/test2 directory && ls -ld directory
lrwxrwxrwx 1 aqua 1000 20 Jul 18 07:17 directory -> /var/lib/mysql/test2

Then, as the root user, in the test2 db:

mysql> create table t1 (a int) ;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)

And as the test user, back in test1:

mysql> insert into t1 values (1),(2),(3) ;
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

Finally, over in test2:

mysql> select * from t1 ;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

Sorry I didn't think of that earlier.  Finally, keep in mind that realpath() isn't atomic -- it's an iteration over lstat() and readlink(); if part of it is replaced with a symlink after the iteration has passed that part, realpath() won't tell you:

00:37:31.512490 getcwd("/tmp"..., 4096) = 5 <0.000016>
00:37:31.512581 lstat("/tmp/a", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=1024, ...}) = 0 <0.000019>
/* inject rename("a", "a.old"); symlink("/var/lib/mysql", "a"); */
00:37:31.512706 lstat("/tmp/a/b", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=1024, ...}) = 0 <0.000017>
```

[18 Jul 2008 7:48]
Devin Carraway
```
BTW, reading over that checkin, by putting a realpath check into the open call you narrow the window of vulnerability considerably -- just keep in mind that symlinks can be anywhere in a path, while lstat() only checks the last component.
```

[18 Jul 2008 8:44]
Sergei Golubchik
```
Right, that's precisely why we moved the check to the place where a file is *opened*, not where it's *created* - to stop attacks like the one you described.

Noted in 5.0.67 changelog.

It was possible to circumvent privileges through the creation of
MyISAM tables employing the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY
options to overwrite existing table files in the MySQL data
directory. Use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and
INDEX DIRECTORY pathname is now disallowed.

Leaving report in Patch Approved status.

For the record, here's a summary history of fixes for this bug:

* Original fix applied to 4.1.24, 5.0.60, 5.1.24, 6.0.5
* Secondary fix applied to 4.1.25, 5.0.70, 5.1.28, 6.0.6
* Original fix applied to first Community release following 5.0.60 (i.e., 5.0.67)
* Original + secondary fixes applied to 5.0.66sp1 Service Pack release

Description for the secondary fix:

Additional corrections were made for the symlink-related privilege
problem originally addressed. The original fix did not correctly
handle the data directory pathname if it contained symlinked
directories in its path, and the check was made only at
table-creation time, not at table-opening time later.

reopened, the fix had a bug: in mysqld.cc, fix_paths() mysql_unpacked_real_data_home was calculated from mysql_real_data_home *before* mysql_real_data_home itself was expanded. For example when mysql_real_data_home was specified as a relative path, mysql_unpacked_real_data_home was interpreting it relatively to a pwd(), not to a mysql_home.

Can anyone confirm that "Fixed a initialization order remark by Serg" fix is what is referred to in 5.1.41 release notes (and also in .24 and .28 as "additional fix in .41")?  The fix is committed in 5.1 bazaar branch:

<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~mysql/mysql-server/mysql-5.1/revision/1810.3967.4>

but it does not seem to have made it to 5.1.41.  Am I missing some other change?

Yes, it should be out with 5.1.42.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- powerdns spoofing problems
The PowerDNS packages were updated to offer better spoofing
resistance by not ignoring invalid queries. (CVE-2008-3337)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- dnsmasq spoofing problems
The DNS server dnsmasq was changed to use random UDP source ports
and a random TRXID now. (CVE-2008-1447)
This problem only affected openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- python multiple problems
The scripting language python was updated to fix several security
vulnerabilities. (CVE-2008-1679,CVE-2008-1887, CVE-2008-3143,

ctrl-v. (CVE-2007-6389)
Updates have been released for openSUSE 10.3, other distributions
were not affected.
- MySQL security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix a security problem:
CVE-2008-2079: MySQL allowed local users to bypass certain privilege
checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1)
DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within
the MySQL home data directory, which can point to tables that are
created in the future.
CVE-2006-7232: sql\_select.cc in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.32 and 5.1.x
before 5.1.14 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA
table, as originally demonstrated using ORDER BY.
MySQL was updated on all SUSE Linux distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Package        : mysql-dfsg-5.0
Vulnerability  : authorization bypass
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-2079
Debian Bug     : 480292

Sergei Golubchik discovered that MySQL, a widely-deployed database
server, did not properly validate optional data or index directory
paths given in a CREATE TABLE statement, nor would it (under proper
conditions) prevent two databases from using the same paths for data
or index files.  This permits an authenticated user with authorization
to create tables in one database to read, write or delete data from
tables subsequently created in other databases, regardless of other
GRANT authorizations.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies this weakness as CVE-2008-2079.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch6.  Note that the fix applied will have the
consequence of disallowing the selection of data or index paths
under the database root, which on a Debian system is /var/lib/mysql;
database administrators needing to control the placement of these
files under that location must do so through other means.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.5, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Impact: Systems that have been manually configured to use rlogin and host.equiv may unexpectedly permit root login

  Description: The manpage for the configuration file hosts.equiv indicates that entries do not apply to root. However, an implementation issue in rlogind causes these entries to also apply to root. This update addresses the issue by properly disallowing rlogin from the root user if the remote system is in hosts.equiv. The rlogin service is not enabled by default in Mac OS X, and must be manually configured in order to be enabled. Credit to Ralf Meyer for reporting this issue.

* **Script Editor**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-4214

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.5, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Impact: A local user may gain the privileges of another user that is using Script Editor

  Description: An insecure file operation issue exists in the Script Editor application when opening application scripting dictionaries. A local user can cause the scripting dictionary to be written to an arbitrary path accessible by the user that is running the application. This update addresses the issue by creating the temporary file in a secure location. Credit: Apple.

* **Single Sign-On**

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.5, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Impact: The sso\_util command now accepts passwords from a file

  Description: The sso\_util command now accepts passwords from a file named in the SSO\_PASSWD\_PATH environment variable. This enables automated scripts to use sso\_util more securely.

* **Tomcat**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2007-6286, CVE-2008-0002, CVE-2008-1232, CVE-2008-1947, CVE-2008-2370, CVE-2008-2938, CVE-2007-5333, CVE-2007-5342, CVE-2007-5461

  Available for: Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in Tomcat 6.0.14

  Description: Tomcat on Mac OS X v10.5 systems is updated to version 6.0.18 to address several vulnerabilities, the most serious of which may lead to a cross site scripting attack. These issues only affect Mac OS X Server systems. Further information is available via the Tomcat site at <http://tomcat.apache.org/>

* **vim**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-2712, CVE-2008-4101, CVE-2008-2712, CVE-2008-3432, CVE-2008-3294

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.5, Mac OS X Server v10.5.5

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in vim 7.0

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in vim 7.0, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution when working with maliciously crafted files. This update addresses the issues by updating to vim 7.2.0.22. Further information is available via the vim website at <http://www.vim.org/>

* **Weblog**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-4215

  Available for: Mac OS X Server v10.4.11

  Impact: Access control on weblog postings may not be enforced

  Description: An unchecked error condition exists in the weblog server. Adding a user with multiple short names to the access control list for a weblog posting may cause the Weblog server to not enforce the access control. This issue is addressed by improving the way access control lists are saved. This issue only affects systems running Mac OS X Server v10.4. Credit: Apple.
