Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Phoenix View CMS Pre Alpha2:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `admin/admin_frame.php`:**

    *   **Root Cause:** The `ltarget` parameter from the GET request is used to include a PHP file without proper sanitization and validation. Specifically, the code checks if the file exists but doesn't validate the `ltarget` value, leading to LFI and the possibility of injecting XSS through the error message.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   Improper input validation and sanitization of the `ltarget` parameter.
        *   Direct inclusion of files based on user input.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **LFI:** An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially exposing sensitive information or executing malicious code if the attacker has uploaded such a file somewhere accessible to the web server.
        *   **XSS:** The error message printed when the file is not found includes the unsanitized `ltarget` parameter, allowing for XSS injection.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   By manipulating the `ltarget` GET parameter.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        *   The attacker must be able to make requests to the affected application.

2.  **SQL Injection (SQLI) in `admin/module/*.php`:**

    *   **Root Cause:** The `del` parameter from the GET request is directly inserted into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   Lack of input sanitization.
        *   Direct use of user input in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   An attacker can manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to, modification of, or deletion of data within the database.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   By manipulating the `del` GET parameter.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        *   The attacker must be able to make requests to the affected application.

3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `admin/module/*.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `conf` parameter from either GET or POST requests is directly echoed into an HTML input field without proper sanitization.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   Lack of output sanitization before echoing user-provided content in HTML.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   By manipulating the `conf` GET or POST parameter.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        * The attacker must be able to make requests to the affected application

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **LFI:** Arbitrary local file inclusion via the `ltarget` parameter.
*   **SQLI:** SQL injection via the `del` parameter.
*   **XSS:** Cross-site scripting via the `ltarget` and `conf` parameters.
