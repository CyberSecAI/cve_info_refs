- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure cookie handling in Internet Photoshow (Special Edition). The application does not properly validate or secure the cookie used for administrative access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application uses a simple cookie named `login_admin` with a value of `true` to determine administrative access. This allows an attacker to forge a valid admin cookie, granting them unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By setting the `login_admin` cookie, an attacker can gain full access to the administrative panel (/admin.php). This can lead to further attacks, such as uploading a shell for command execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack can be performed remotely via the client browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript on the vulnerable site to set the malicious cookie. This can be done through a user's browser.
