Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2921:

**1. Verification of CVE Relation:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2008-2921 and provides details on the vulnerability.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` file of ezcms version 1.2 and prior. Specifically, the `page` variable is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to blind SQL injection. This means an attacker can inject SQL queries into the `page` parameter and infer results through the application's responses, even without seeing the actual database output directly.
    *   **Insecure File Manager:** The application contains a hidden file manager accessible at `/ezcms/admin/filemanager/` which allows unauthenticated users to upload, edit, delete and move files/folders.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** Through successful SQL injection, an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information in the database, modify data, or even gain control of the application's logic.
    *  **Arbitrary Remote File Manager Access:** An attacker can gain control of the server by uploading a malicious web shell by abusing the file manager.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** The attack vector is through the `page` parameter in the `index.php` file using HTTP GET requests. An attacker would craft malicious SQL queries as the value of this parameter. Example: `http://site.com/index.php?page=1 and 1=1` or `http://site.com/index.php?page=1 and 1=2` to test for injection.
    *  **Arbitrary Remote File Manager Access:** The attack vector is via a web browser to the `/ezcms/admin/filemanager/` URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, and be able to analyse the response from the server.
    *   **Arbitrary Remote File Manager Access:** The attacker only needs network connectivity to access the vulnerable server and a web browser.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry notes that while blind SQL injection exists, it is not necessary to exploit it due to the presence of the insecure file manager which allows for easier remote code execution.
*   The provided content from flexera.com is about their vulnerability research and products and does not contain specific vulnerability details of CVE-2008-2921.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

The ezcms version 1.2 application has two primary vulnerabilities:

1.  A blind SQL injection vulnerability within `index.php` via the `page` parameter.
2.  An insecure file manager accessible at `/ezcms/admin/filemanager/`, which allows for arbitrary remote file manipulation. The file manager is the easiest vector for an attacker to exploit.
