How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# 3.0.3, 3.1.3, 2.22.3, and 2.20.5 Security Advisory

Sunday, May 4th, 2008
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Users without the "canconfirm" privilege could enter a bug as NEW
  or ASSIGNED by using the XML-RPC interface.

* When viewing several bugs at once, there was a Cross-Site Scripting hole.

* The inbound email interface allowed you to set the Reporter via the
  text of the email, instead of just using the From header.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Unauthorized Bug Change
Affected:    3.1.3
Description: Users normally need the "canconfirm" privilege to put bugs
             in the NEW or ASSIGNED state. However, users were being
             allowed to create bugs in the NEW or ASSIGNED state if they
             were creating the bug through the XML-RPC interface.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=415471

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.17.2 and higher
Description: When using the "Format for Printing" view of a bug (or
             the "Long Format" of a bug list, which is the same thing),
             there was a cross-site scripting hole--arbitrary text
             from a particular URL parameter could be injected into the
             page without filtering.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=425665

Class:       Account Impersonation (Minor)
Affected:    2.23.4 and higher
Description: By design, email_in.pl always believes the "From" header as
             the user making changes or uses that as the reporter of the
             bug. However, you could also specify the changer/reporter in
             the body of the email and override the "From" header, possibly
             bypassing some security checks set up by administrators
             against the "From" header.
             For most installations this is a minor or inconsequential
             issue, as the documentation of email_in.pl already explains
             that it does not do any user authentication (it just
             believes the "From" header), so installations using it should
             not have been expecting user account security (though they
             may have had checks against the "From" header--that is what
             makes this a security issue).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

You have to remove bug.bug\_id from filterexceptions.pl, else runtests.pl complains.

Note that despite $bug is an object, $bug->bug\_id returns a \*string\* if the bug doesn't exist, instead of the expected bug ID taken from the DB. That's a pretty bad behavior. We should rather add the invalid string into another object attribute, like $bug->{'invalid\_bug\_alias'} or something, so that we know we cannot trust it. I don't want to do a full scan of all templates to see where bug.bug\_id is assumes trusted.

patch against 3.0
Something needs to be done to template/en/default/global/per-bug-queries.html.tmpl, too. The vulnerable part is $bugids there:
<input type="text" name="bug\_ids" size="12" maxlength="80"
[%- " value=\"$bugids\"" IF bugids %]>
<input type="submit" value="Commit" id="commit\_list\_of\_bugs">

This bad behavior also exists in Bugzilla 2.20.5, so this is not a regression, at least not in the last 4 years.

this comes out of the error handling stuff in bug.pm, which is done to handle XML stuff (which does filter correctly)
As lpsolit mentioned on IRC, for safety we should probably return an unblessed object with { error => 'foo', 'requested\_id' => $orig\_bug\_id } to avoid this sort of confusion, and change the few templates that need to care. Alternately we could just throw from within the Bug constructor and let the caller do whatever it needs to.....
I don't think that per-bug-queries is the same issue - it doesn't trigger for me - not sure why?

Maybe is it time for Bugzilla::Bug->new() to return undef if the param doesn't match anything, and let pages handle this correctly. This would fix [bug 348397](/show_bug.cgi?id=348397 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Bugzilla::Bug::AUTOLOAD is not affected by $self->{error}") (another security bug) at the same time.

You have to remove this entry from filterexceptions.pl as well. I still think the right fix is to not return a fake bug.bug\_id if the pseudo-alias doesn't match anything.

This won't work. It will still have the invalid string, and clicking "Commit" will throw an error. Only valid bug IDs should be passed here.

bug\_id should always return a number. Always, always.
Yes, Bugzilla::Bug->new should return undef, but we can't backport that to 2.20, or even to 3.0.
Bugzilla::Bug->new should not return an unblessed reference. That would lead to a lot of confusion in the calling code.
The simple solution is just to have bug\_id always return a number and deal with the error string another way.Severity: blocker → criticalSummary: XSS in show\_bug.cgi → XSS in show\_bug.cgi: id isn't filtered for format=multiple

This is the less invasive fix possible, and also the safest one. Now we are sure you cannot use XSS here. And I \*really\* don't mind if the string appears double-escaped somewhere. 99% of aliases don't use <, >, & or " anyway (I would even tend to forbid them in \_check\_alias(), but that's another story).Assignee: query-and-buglist → LpSolit

patch, v3
This technically breaks the xml output; if someone passes in a string (to be treated as an alias), the returned error object won't match what they passed in due to the extra escaping, so code can't report a useful error.
What I had, when an extra grep { !$\_->error } before populating the tags thing (rather than doing it in the filter) I think is less invasive.

patch, v3
For the tip I'd like to fix it in some better way, but this is fine for branches.
This will need a backport to older branches, since they have slightly different code, I think.
Is bug.bug\_id already in filterexceptions for show-multiple?

Well, I wouldn't object to a fix that I was sure only affected \*this\*--that's the one thing that does make me slightly nervous about LpSolit's patch, is that it affects all of Bugzilla.

I know, and I \*really\* don't mind, as discussed on IRC. Implementing $bug->{bug\_id} this way to return an unsafe string is a big error. This has always been so, since rev 1.1 by endico in June 2000. And as I said, 99% of aliases don't use <, >, " or & anyway, so that's really a \*minor\* annoyance (not important enough to fight against this XSS attack).

It's not less invasive, and it's not safer as we would have to make sure we caught all unfiltered places.

I would prefer to go this way for now, so that we can release asap, and file a separate bug to think a bit more about how to fix it in a clever way for 3.2.

Sure, though not very different. :)
> Is bug.bug\_id already in filterexceptions for show-multiple?
Yes, which is why you can trigger the XSS attack.

Note that there is a 2nd XSS hole in 3.2, due to [bug 389541](/show_bug.cgi?id=389541 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide a way to get from full text bug listing to short bug listing"):
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/webtools/bugzilla/template/en/default/bug/show-multiple.html.tmpl#44>
[% ids.join(",") FILTER none %] contains the unsafe string, and it's not filtered, so the XSS attack is still possible. Two ways to fix them:
1) Write [% ids.push(bug.bug\_id) UNLESS bug.error %]
2) Write [% ids.join(",") FILTER html %]
I suggest to combine them both.
(now you understand why I like fixing the problem at its root rather than tracking all places which don't filter bug IDs).Status: NEW → ASSIGNED
