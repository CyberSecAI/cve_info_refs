Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the Call of Duty 4 server handles the "stats" command. Specifically, the server accepts an invalid type (type 7) for this command. When this invalid type is processed, it leads to a `memcpy()` operation with a negative size value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The server does not properly validate the type of "stats" command received from the client.
- **Negative Size in memcpy:** The server uses the received "stats" type directly in a `memcpy()` operation which can cause a negative size argument. This occurs because the server does not account for an invalid type (type 7) that causes the calculation to go negative.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack results in the remote game server crashing due to the negative size `memcpy()`, causing a denial of service for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is initiated by sending a "stats" packet with the invalid type (7).
- This can be achieved by modifying a valid client's "stats" packet using a proxy.
- An attacker can also craft a custom packet for testing purposes on local LAN.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the game server.
- **Authentication (Potentially):** The attacker might need to:
    - Be a valid user connected to the server.
    - Know the server password if the server is password-protected.
    - Not be banned from the server.
    - Have a valid CD key if required by the server.
- **Packet Manipulation:** Ability to manipulate or craft UDP packets to include the malicious stats type 7.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare versions 1.5 and earlier.
- The vulnerability can be exploited on both Windows and Linux servers.
- The exploit is triggered after the client joins the server and attempts to send stats.
- The attacker does not control the source data or the negative size used in the `memcpy()` operation, but rather they cause the negative value to occur through the invalid type, and it is enough to crash the server.
- No fix was available at the time of the report.
