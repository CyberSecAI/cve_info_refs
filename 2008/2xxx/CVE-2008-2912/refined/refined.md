Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The Contenido CMS application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input for file paths, allowing an attacker to include remote files. Specifically, the `contenido_path`, `cfg[path][contenido]`, and `cfg[path][templates]` parameters are vulnerable.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not adequately sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in the web page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This is seen in the `contenido` parameter of index.php, and potentially in "Belang" and "username" variables through POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing for both RFI and XSS attacks.
*   **Insecure Parameter Handling:** Parameters like `contenido_path`, `cfg[path][contenido]`, `cfg[path][templates]` and `contenido` are directly used without proper sanitization, leading to vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the RFI vulnerability, an attacker can include a remote shell (like c99in.txt), leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Malicious Script Injection:** Through XSS, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The RFI vulnerabilities are exploited via GET requests, injecting malicious URLs in vulnerable parameters.
*   **HTTP GET/POST Requests:** The XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited via GET requests, or via POST requests targeting "Belang" and "username" fields

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Contenido CMS instance.
*   **Remote Server:** For RFI exploitation, the attacker requires a remote server where the malicious payload is hosted.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploits indicate that these vulnerabilities can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Specific Vulnerable Files and Parameters:**

The following files and parameters are vulnerable to RFI:

*   `backend_search.php?contenido_path=[URL]`
*   `cronjobs/move_articles.php?cfg[path][contenido]=[URL]`
*   `cronjobs/move_old_stats.php?cfg[path][contenido]=[URL]`
*   `cronjobs/optimize_database.php?cfg[path][contenido]=[URL]`
*   `cronjobs/run_newsletter_job.php?cfg[path][contenido]=[URL]`
*   `cronjobs/send_reminder.php?cfg[path][contenido]=[URL]`
*   `cronjobs/session_cleanup.php?cfg[path][contenido]=[URL]`
*   `cronjobs/setfrontenduserstate.php?cfg[path][contenido]=[URL]`
*   `includes/include.newsletter_jobs_subnav.php?cfg[path][templates]=[URL]`
*  `plugins/content_allocation/includes/include.right_top.php?cfg[path][templates]=[URL]`
*   `includes/include.newsletter_jobs_subnav.php?cfg[templates][right_top_blank]=[URL]`
*  `plugins/content_allocation/includes/include.right_top.php?cfg[path][contenido]=[URL]`
*  `plugins/content_allocation/includes/include.right_top.php?cfg[templates][right_top_blank]=[URL]`

The following is vulnerable to XSS

*   `index.php?contenido=[JavaScript code]`
*  POST method to "Belang" also "username" fields

**Additional Notes**

The provided exploit also mentions that Contenido version 4.8.4 is vulnerable but that older versions could be affected.
