{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user input in multiple places.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI) in `admin/admin_frame.php`",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `admin/admin_frame.php`",
      "SQL Injection (SQLI) in `admin/module/*.php`",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `admin/module/*.php`"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve the following:\n- Local File Inclusion (LFI): Read arbitrary files on the server.\n- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser.\n- SQL Injection (SQLI): Modify or read arbitrary data in the database.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "LFI: By manipulating the `ltarget` parameter in the URL of `admin/admin_frame.php`.",
    "XSS: By manipulating the `ltarget` parameter in the URL of `admin/admin_frame.php` or the `conf` parameter in `admin/module/*.php`.",
    "SQLI: By manipulating the `del` parameter in the URL of `admin/module/*.php`."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the parameters in the URL."
