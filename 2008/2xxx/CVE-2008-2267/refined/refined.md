Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2267

**Vulnerable Software:** CMS Made Simple version 1.2.4 and potentially earlier versions. Specifically, the vulnerability exists within the FileManager module's `javaUpload.php` script. This script is part of the 'postlet' functionality which is used for uploading files.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the insufficient file extension filtering within the `javaUpload.php` script. The script attempts to prevent the upload of certain file types by checking the file extension against a blacklist, but the blacklist is incomplete.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Blacklist:** The `$file_extension_list` array in `javaUpload.php` only blocks "php", "asp", and "pl" extensions by default. It doesn't block other executable extensions like "php3", "php5", "jsp", "cgi", "dhtml", "phtml", etc.
*   **Lack of proper extension check:** The code extracts the extension by taking the last element of the `explode('.', $_FILES['userfile']['name'])` array, so a file named "file.php.x" is treated as having "x" extension.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload a file with an executable extension that is not on the blacklist (e.g., ".php5", ".phtml", etc.).
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP script, the attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a multipart/form-data POST request to the `javaUpload.php` script.
*   **File Upload:**  The malicious PHP file is included in the POST request using the `userfile` parameter and exploiting the inadequate extension check, bypassing the filter.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** After the file is uploaded, an attacker can send an HTTP GET request to execute the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable CMS Made Simple installation.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker needs access to the vulnerable `javaUpload.php` script, which is typically accessible via the web.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable script and the incomplete blacklist.
*   **Ability to craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to construct a multipart/form-data POST request to upload a file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit code (from exploit-db.com) demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability by uploading a PHP shell. It shows how to create the malicious POST request and interact with the uploaded shell.
*   The vulnerability is present because the default configuration of `javaUpload.php` uses a blacklist approach that does not include many dangerous extensions.
*   The code comments in the vulnerable `javaUpload.php` file explicitly state that the script has security risks and should be protected with session variables or by uploading files to a directory outside the web document root. This highlights the awareness of the vulnerability, however it was not remediated correctly.
*   The exploit code provided uses a double extension technique (e.g., .php.ext) which will lead to the file being named as .php.ext in the upload directory.
