```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `systemId` parameter.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or execute arbitrary SQL commands. In this specific case the attacker is trying to extract admin credentials.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is accessible via an HTTP GET request to `index.php` with the `systemId` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
