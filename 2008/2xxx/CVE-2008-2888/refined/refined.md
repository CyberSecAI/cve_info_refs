- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the way it handles the `GLOBALS[application][app_root]` parameter in the `collection.class.php` and `content_image.class.php` files.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to system compromise and complete control over the vulnerable server.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `GLOBALS[application][app_root]` parameter in the vulnerable PHP files.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication or special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
