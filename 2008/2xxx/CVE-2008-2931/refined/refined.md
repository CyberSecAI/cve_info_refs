Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2008-2931:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `do_change_type` routine in the Linux kernel's `fs/namespace.c` file lacks a privilege check. Specifically, it doesn't verify if the caller has the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability before changing mount propagation settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Privilege Check:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a `capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)` check in the `do_change_type` function. This allows unprivileged users to call this function directly.
*   **Bypass of `mount` Command Restrictions:**  While the `mount` command itself restricts mount type changes to root users, the missing check in `do_change_type` allows local, unprivileged users to circumvent this restriction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation/Abuse:** Although not a direct privilege escalation, a local user could abuse the ability to change mount point properties, potentially impacting the system's stability and intended behavior.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** By manipulating mount properties, a local user can cause a denial of service. For example:
    *   Mark a mount as unbindable, preventing the administrator from re-binding it.
    *   Silently mark a private mount as shared, causing unexpected sharing if an administrator later bind mounts it.
*  **Arbitrary mount point modifications:** Local users could change the mount directory, which could have unpredictable consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local; an attacker needs to have a shell/login on the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system but does not require root or administrative privileges.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Linux Kernel versions from 2.6.15-rc1 up to 2.6.21.
*   Specifically mentioned are:
    *   SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 SP1, SP2
    *   SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP1, SP2
    *   SLE SDK 10 SP1, SP2
    *   Debian 4.0 (etch) kernel 2.6.18.dfsg.1-22etch2
    *   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
    
**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed by adding a `capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)` check to the `do_change_type` function.
*   Vendor updates address this vulnerability (SUSE, Debian, Red Hat).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to change the mount propagation settings which are usually restricted to root user only.
*   The `mount` command restricts changing mountpoint type to only root, but this check is missing in the `do_change_type` kernel function, allowing the bypass.
