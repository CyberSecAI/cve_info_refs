The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities affecting various Xigla products. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple products suffer from SQL injection vulnerabilities via the `orderby` parameter in `search.asp` and similar files.
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input passed to SQL queries.
    *   **Affected Products & Files**:
        *   Absolute Live Support XE: `search.asp`
        *   Absolute News Manager XE: `search.asp`
        *   Absolute Banner Manager XE: `searchbanners.asp`
        *   Absolute Form Processor XE: `search.asp`
        *   Absolute Image Gallery XE: `gallery.asp`
        *  Absolute Poll Manager XE: `search.asp`
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with malicious SQL code in the `orderby` or other vulnerable parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL queries can be executed, leading to potential data breaches, data manipulation or other attacks on the database.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable pages.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple products exhibit XSS vulnerabilities in various files.
    *   **Root Cause:** Failure to sanitize user-supplied input before outputting to HTML, allowing injection of malicious scripts
    *   **Affected Products & Files:**
        *   Absolute Live Support XE: `search.asp` (all fields)
        *   Absolute News Manager XE: `anmviewer.asp`, `search.asp`, `editarticleX.asp`, `publishers.asp` (all fields)
        *   Absolute Banner Manager XE: `searchbanners.asp`, `listadvertisers.asp` (all fields)
        *   Absolute Form Processor XE: `search.asp`, `users.asp` (all fields)
        *   Absolute Image Gallery XE: `gallery.asp`, `search.asp` (all fields)
        *   Absolute Poll Manager XE: `search.asp` (all fields)
        *   Absolute Control Panel XE: `users.asp` (all fields)
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into vulnerable input fields or parameters.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could inject client-side scripts, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the web page.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable pages.

*   **Solution:** Sanitization of user inputs in the source code.

**Additional Notes**

* The content provides proof-of-concept (POC) URLs demonstrating the vulnerabilities.
* The "admin" designation in parentheses next to some affected products seems to indicate that some vulnerabilities are found in the admin panel of the corresponding product.

Based on the provided information, this content provides more details than a generic CVE description would, specifically pinpointing the vulnerable parameters and files within each affected product and including POC URLs for each case.

The content is relevant to a vulnerability disclosure report but it is impossible to verify if it relates to a specific CVE without the CVE description, therefore, I will respond with **NOINFO**.
