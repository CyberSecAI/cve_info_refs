Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-2882:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple issues within the sHibby sHop v2.2 application, specifically involving SQL injection and direct access to sensitive files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `default.asp` page, specifically via the `git` and `sayfa` parameters.
    *   Example attack vector: `http://target.com/path/default.asp?git=4&sayfa=-3+union+all+select+0,copy,keyword+from+ayarlar`
2.  **Direct Access to Update File:** The `upgrade.asp` file is directly accessible, which can be a security risk.
    *   Example attack vector: `http://localsite.com/path/upgrade.asp`
3.  **Direct Access to Database File:** The default database file `urun.mdb` is directly accessible.
    *   Example attack vector: `http://target.com/path/Db/urun.mdb`

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or potentially gain further access to the system by using the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Direct File Access:** Direct access to the upgrade and database files can allow an attacker to gain access to the database contents and also allows for the possibility of manipulating files.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** All vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable via HTTP requests.
*   **SQL Injection:** Crafted URLs with malicious SQL queries via the `default.asp` page parameters.
*   **Direct file access:** Direct access to the `upgrade.asp` and database files (`urun.mdb`) via HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No authentication is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by "KnocKout".
*   The CVSS base score is 7.5/10, with an exploitability subscore of 10/10. This indicates a relatively high risk and ease of exploitation.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-264, which relates to permissions, privileges, and access controls. This classification is somewhat misleading since the main vulnerability is SQL injection.
*   The database file is a Microsoft Access database (.mdb).
