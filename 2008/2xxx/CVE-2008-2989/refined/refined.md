Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `index.php` file of HoMaP-CMS version 0.1. The `go` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a database query.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive information (such as usernames and passwords from the `user` table), and potentially modify data or compromise the entire database.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL using the `go` parameter. The attacker injects SQL code, using techniques like `union select`, into the vulnerable parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, specifically crafting the `go` parameter within the URL. No prior authentication is required for this exploit.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit URL provided is: `index.php?go=0'+union+select+passwd+from+user+where+username=[USERNAME]`
This URL attempts to retrieve the password from the user table based on a provided username using SQL injection.
