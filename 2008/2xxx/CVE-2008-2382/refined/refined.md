  "CVE-2008-2382": {
    "Description": "Alfredo Ortega discovered that KVM's VNC protocol handler did not correctly validate certain messages. A remote attacker could send specially crafted VNC messages that would cause KVM to consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "Improper validation of VNC messages.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Denial of service vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to excessive CPU consumption.",
    "Attack vector": "Sending specially crafted VNC messages.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Remote network access to the vulnerable KVM instance."
