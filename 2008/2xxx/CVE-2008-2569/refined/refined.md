Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2569:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `gbid` parameter of the Joomla! Component EasyBook version 1.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`gbid` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Data Breach:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, such as usernames and password hashes.
* **Account Takeover:** The attacker can retrieve the administrator's username and password hash which can be used to gain administrative access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable component.
* **Manipulated Parameter:** The `gbid` parameter in the POST request is modified with malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Joomla! application.
* **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not require prior authentication to be executed.
* **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Component:** The attacker needs to know that the Joomla component EasyBook 1.1 is installed.

**Additional details:**
* The exploit code provides an example of how to extract admin login credentials using a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection.
* The provided exploit code uses a Perl script to demonstrate the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2008-2569 describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Joomla! Component EasyBook 1.1, allowing attackers to retrieve sensitive data like user credentials by injecting SQL code through the `gbid` parameter.
