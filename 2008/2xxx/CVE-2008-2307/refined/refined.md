Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2307:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within WebKit's handling of JavaScript arrays.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper handling of JavaScript arrays. Specifically, this relates to a failure in bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to:
  - Unexpected application termination (crashes).
  - Arbitrary code execution (allowing the attacker to run their own code on the victim's machine).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Visiting a maliciously crafted website is the primary attack vector. The attacker must craft a website that contains JavaScript code that triggers the memory corruption when processed by WebKit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver a malicious website to the victim. The victim simply needs to visit the website for the attack to potentially occur.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects systems using Apple WebKit, including the Safari web browser.
- It impacts both Windows and Mac OS X operating systems.
- The issue is addressed by improved bounds checking in the WebKit code.
- The vulnerability was reported by James Urquhart.
- The fix for Mac OS X 10.5.4 is delivered by Safari 3.1.2, the fix for Mac OS X 10.4.11 is delivered by Safari 3.1.2, and the fix for Windows XP and Vista is delivered by Safari 3.1.2 as well.
- CERT/CC's vulnerability note VU#361043 confirms that the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.
