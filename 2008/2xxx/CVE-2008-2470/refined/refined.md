**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability within the ActiveX control.
- Improper handling of error responses (specifically 404 errors) when using the `ExecuteRemote()` method.
- The vulnerable control was marked "Safe for Scripting," which allowed it to be scripted by Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user viewing the crafted content.
-  Denial of service through crashing Internet Explorer or a program using the WebBrowser control.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Remote attack vector
-  Exploitation through specially crafted HTML documents, such as web pages or HTML emails/attachments.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to view the crafted content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host or deliver a malicious HTML document.
- Requires no authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user to view the malicious HTML.

**Additional details from the document:**
- The vulnerability is present in older versions of the ActiveX control (isusweb.dll) included with some InstallShield installers.
-  Newer versions by Macrovision or Acresso are not vulnerable.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by:
    - Applying the FLEXnet Connect 6.0 Security Patch (which removes the "Safe for Scripting" setting).
    - Disabling the ActiveX control via setting a kill bit in the registry.
    - Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone within the browser.
