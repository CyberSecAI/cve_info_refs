Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-2083

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `directory.php` file of the Prozilla Hosting Index application. Specifically, the `cat_id` parameter is not sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. This means that an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query by manipulating the `cat_id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as user IDs, names, emails, and hashed passwords.
- **System access:** The advisory states that system access could be achieved. While not detailed, the ability to run arbitrary SQL could be leveraged to potentially achieve this.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `directory.php` script, supplying a modified `cat_id` parameter.
  Example:  `http://www.target.com/[hostindex_path]/directory.php?ax=list&sub=7&cat_id=-1%20union%20select%201,2,concat(id,0x3a,name,0x3a,email,0x3a,password),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14%20from%20links--`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via a web browser.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax to construct a working injection payload.
- **Vulnerable Application Instance:** The attacker needs access to an instance of the vulnerable Prozilla Hosting Index application.
- **Magic Quotes Disabled:** The exploit relies on `magic_quotes` being disabled in the PHP configuration of the target server.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit-db entry provides a specific Proof of Concept (PoC) URL and a Google dork to help locate vulnerable installations.
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was found on December 15, 2007, and the advisory was released on April 28, 2008.
- The vulnerability is considered a "Medium" severity.

**Mitigation:**
- The provided solution suggests sanitizing user-provided input to ensure it's safe for use in SQL queries.
- Additionally, enabling `magic_quotes` in `php.ini` can provide some (but not complete) protection.
