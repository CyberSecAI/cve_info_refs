Reporter
Gregory Fleischer
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.15
* Firefox 3

### Description

Security researcher **Gregory Fleischer** reported a
vulnerability in the way Mozilla indicates the origin of a document to the
Java Embedding Plugin (JEP) that ships with Firefox on Mac OS X. This
vulnerability could allow a malicious Java applet to bypass the same-origin
policy and create arbitrary socket connections to other domains.

### Workaround

Disable Java on Mac OS X until a version containing these fixes can be installed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-619-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

2 July 2008

Firefox vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) -

## Details

Various flaws were discovered in the browser engine. By tricking

a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could cause

a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2008-2798](/security/CVE-2008-2798), [CVE-2008-2799](/security/CVE-2008-2799))

Several problems were discovered in the JavaScript engine. If a

user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker

could perform cross-site scripting attacks. ([CVE-2008-2800](/security/CVE-2008-2800))

Collin Jackson discovered various flaws in the JavaScript engine

which allowed JavaScript to be injected into signed JAR files. If

a user were tricked into opening malicious web content, an

attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of a different website or link content within the JAR file to an

attacker-controlled JavaScript file. ([CVE-2008-2801](/security/CVE-2008-2801))

It was discovered that Firefox would allow non-privileged XUL

documents to load chrome scripts from the fastload file. This

could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with

chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-2802](/security/CVE-2008-2802))

A flaw was discovered in Firefox that allowed overwriting trusted

objects via mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript(). If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2008-2803](/security/CVE-2008-2803))

Claudio Santambrogio discovered a vulnerability in Firefox which

could lead to stealing of arbitrary files. If a user were tricked

into opening malicious content, an attacker could force the browser

into uploading local files to the remote server. ([CVE-2008-2805](/security/CVE-2008-2805))

Gregory Fleischer discovered a flaw in Java LiveConnect. An attacker

could exploit this to bypass the same-origin policy and create

arbitrary socket connections to other domains. ([CVE-2008-2806](/security/CVE-2008-2806))

Daniel Glazman found that an improperly encoded .properties file

in an add-on can result in uninitialized memory being used. If

a user were tricked into installing a malicious add-on, the

browser may be able to see data from other programs.

([CVE-2008-2807](/security/CVE-2008-2807))

Masahiro Yamada discovered that Firefox did not properly sanitize

file URLs in directory listings, resulting in files from directory

listings being opened in unintended ways or not being able to be

opened by the browser at all. ([CVE-2008-2808](/security/CVE-2008-2808))

John G. Myers discovered a weakness in the trust model used by

Firefox regarding alternate names on self-signed certificates. If

a user were tricked into accepting a certificate containing

alternate name entries, an attacker could impersonate another

server. ([CVE-2008-2809](/security/CVE-2008-2809))

A flaw was discovered in the way Firefox opened URL files. If a user

were tricked into opening a bookmark to a malicious web page, the

page could potentially read from local files on the user's computer.

([CVE-2008-2810](/security/CVE-2008-2810))

A vulnerability was discovered in the block reflow code of Firefox.

This vulnerability could be used by an attacker to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2811](/security/CVE-2008-2811))

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)
* [5 Release Engineering](#Release_Engineering)

* [11 Web Compatibility](#Web_Compatibility)
* [12 Scrum Development](#Scrum_Development)
* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 2.0.0.15, fixing various bugs
including following security bugs.
CVE-2008-2798 CVE-2008-2799 MFSA 2008-21:
Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the
browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some
of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some
of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
CVE-2008-2800 MFSA 2008-22:
Mozilla contributor moz\_bug\_r\_a4 submitted a set of vulnerabilities
which allow scripts from one document to be executed in the context
of a different document. These vulnerabilities could be used by an
attacker to violate the same-origin policy and perform an XSS attack.
CVE-2008-2801 MFSA 2008-23:
Security researcher Collin Jackson reported a series of vulnerabilities
which allow JavaScript to be injected into signed JARs and executed
under the context of the JAR's signer. This could allow an attacker
to run JavaScript in a victim's browser with the privileges of a
different website, provided the attacker possesses a JAR signed by
the other website.
CVE-2008-2802 MFSA 2008-24:
Mozilla contributor moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a vulnerability that
allowed non-privileged XUL documents to load chrome scripts from
the fastload file. This could allow an attacker to run arbitrary
JavaScript code with chrome privileges.
CVE-2008-2803 MFSA 2008-25:
Mozilla contributor moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a vulnerability which allows
arbitrary JavaScript to be executed with chrome privileges. The
privilege escalation was possible because JavaScript loaded via
mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript() was not using XPCNativeWrappers
when accessing content. This could allow an attacker to overwrite
trusted objects with arbitrary code which would be executed with
chrome privileges when the trusted objects were called by the browser.
CVE-2008-2805 MFSA 2008-27:
Opera developer Claudio Santambrogio reported a vulnerability which
allows malicious content to force the browser into uploading local
files to the remote server. This could be used by an attacker to
steal arbitrary files from a victim's computer.
CVE-2008-2806 MFSA 2008-28:
Security researcher Gregory Fleischer reported a vulnerability
in the way Mozilla indicates the origin of a document to the Java
plugin. This vulnerability could allow a malicious Java applet to
bypass the same-origin policy and create arbitrary socket connections
to other domains.
CVE-2008-2807 MFSA 2008-29:
Mozilla developer Daniel Glazman demonstrated that an improperly
encoded .properties file in an add-on can result in uninitialized
memory being used. This could potentially result in small chunks of
data from other programs being exposed in the browser.
CVE-2008-2808 MFSA 2008-30:
Mozilla contributor Masahiro Yamada reported that file URLs in
directory listings were not being HTML escaped properly when the
filenames contained particular characters. This resulted in files
from directory listings being opened in unintended ways or files not
being able to be opened by the browser altogether.
CVE-2008-2809 MFSA 2008-31:
Mozilla developer John G. Myers reported a weakness in the trust
model used by Mozilla regarding alternate names on self-signed
certificates. A user could be prompted to accept a self-signed
certificate from a website which includes alt-name entries. If
the user accepted the certificate, they would also extend trust to
any alternate domains listed in the certificate, despite not being
prompted about the additional domains. This technique could be used
by an attacker to impersonate another server.
CVE-2008-2810 MFSA 2008-32:
Mozilla community member Geoff reported a vulnerability in the way
Mozilla opens URL files sent directly to the browser. He demonstrated
that such files were opened with local file privileges, giving the
remote content access to read from the local filesystem. If a user
opened a bookmark to a malicious page in this manner, the page could
potentially read from other local files on the user's computer.
CVE-2008-2811 MFSA 2008-33:
Security research firm Astabis, via the iSIGHT Partners GVP Program,
reported a vulnerability in Mozilla's block reflow code. This
vulnerability could be used by an attacker to crash the browser and
run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Firefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Apple has released Java for Mac OS X 10.4, Release 6 ( available from <http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/javaformacosx104release6.html> ). The update appears to contain fixes for the DNS rebinding vulnerabilities discussed in [bug #389625](/show_bug.cgi?id=389625 "RESOLVED FIXED - DNS rebinding vulnerabilities in plug-ins").
Even though the Java runtime has been updated, the Firefox Mac OS X Java Plugin (MRJ Plugin) appears to remain vulnerable to the 'document.domain' bypass. By using the document.domain exception to the same origin policy, LiveConnect can be used to create arbitrary socket connections.
Sun Java Runtime Environment fixes for Windows and Linux were released at the beginning of October. With the Sun JRE updates, the Firefox Java plugins on these platforms are no longer vulnerable to the document.domain bypass.
A demo showing how connections can be made to a localhost web server via the loopback device is available from the URL above.
Reproducible: Always

I marked this bug as security-sensitive, but the general issue so well known that may be pointless.
Also, my previous comment wasn't entirely clear. The URL of the demo is <http://b64.localhost.pseudo-flaw.net/mrj-plugin-test.html>

I've confirmed this, both on OS X 10.4.11 with Apple's new Java for
Mac OS X Release 6, and on OS X 10.5.1 (whose JVM already contained
the updates that are new in 10.4's Java Release 6).
(Background: Mozilla.org distros on the Mac that can use Java have
for some time bundled the Java Embedding Plugin
(<http://javaplugin.sorceforge.net/>), which allows non-WebKit browsers
to use current Java versions on OS X. The JEP's binaries are two
plugins -- JavaEmbeddingPlugin.bundle (the main part of the program)
and MRJPlugin.plugin (a forked descendent of Mozilla.org's MRJ Plugin
Carbon, adapted for use with JavaEmbeddingPlugin.bundle and containing
many additional bugfixes, which I now call the MRJ Plugin JEP). I'm
the JEP's author.)
Most of the JEP's implementation of LiveConnect is in the JEP's
MRJPlugin.plugin, and is (basically) entirely separate from Apple's
own LiveConnect implementation. So it's not entirely surprising that
Apple's changes didn't fix this problem in the JEP.
The problem could (conceivably) be addressed in the JEP. But the JEP
(the MRJ Plugin JEP) gets the applet's host's hostname from the
browser (via a call to
nsIScriptSecurityManager::GetSubjectPrincipal()). So I think it's
more appropriate to address this problem in the browser.
I don't know if the patch for [bug 389625](/show_bug.cgi?id=389625 "RESOLVED FIXED - DNS rebinding vulnerabilities in plug-ins") ([attachment 279764](/attachment.cgi?id=279764 "Patch for Firefox 3 (NSPR 4.7) by Adam Barth") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=279764&action=edit "Patch for Firefox 3 (NSPR 4.7) by Adam Barth") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=279764&action=diff "Patch for Firefox 3 (NSPR 4.7) by Adam Barth") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=389625&attachment=279764)) will also
fix this problem. I'll try it and let you know my results.
By the way, does this problem still effect Flash, or other kinds of
plugins?
The MRJ Plugin JEP's call to
nsIScriptSecurityManager::GetSubjectPrincipal() happens in
CSecureEnv.cpp's CSecureEnv::sendMessageToJava() method.

I haven't tried it ... but I know that it won't work --
PR\_GetHostByName() is never called while loading this bug's test case.
I'll be looking for some other way to change the browser to fix this
bug.

The consequences of this bug seem to be the same as for [bug 402995](/show_bug.cgi?id=402995 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol content can use LiveConnect to connect to arbitrary ports on localhost").
So I think this bug is pretty serious, and should be fixed soon (if
not right away).
Daniel and Jesse, what do you think?
I'm wondering if I should drop everything else and work on this. And
in particular, I'm wondering if (assuming this won't be fixed in the
browser anytime soon) I should immediately start working on an update
to the JEP (which would take about a week).
I know Josh doesn't want me to :-) And to be honest I've got plenty
of other stuff to do, and am not particularly eager myself. But what
do you guys think?

The old MRJCarbon code appears to use nsIPrincipal::GetOrigin() which takes document.domain into account. This shouldn't be used for anything in Java which wants a much more strict same-origin policy.
This has bitten us several times. Short of dumping document.domain altogether (oh how I wish...) we need to rethink what nsIPrincipal offers. I think only caps itself cares about whether document.domain has been set or not, so maybe we can make GetDomain() return what GetOrigin() now does and GetOrigin() can return a cleaned-up scheme+host+port on the real origin URI. (plus some internal way for caps to see if domain is set).

And so does the MRJ Plugin JEP.
How should I change this in the next version of the JEP (leaving
undecided exactly when that will happen)?

With this bug's testcase, nsIPrincipal::GetOrigin() returns
"<http://localhost.pseudo-flaw.net>".

Or let me put this a different way:
Is there currently any (better) alternative (for the MRJ Plugin JEP)
to calling GetOrigin() on an nsIPrincipal() object returned by
nsIScriptSecurityManager::GetSubjectPrincipal()?
And if so what is it?

I don't know about "better", but what you need to do is drop any use of GetOrigin() for Java and use the principal's URI. To do that safely you'll have to duplicate GetOrigin's unwrapping of nested protocols, and you have to deal with the fact that it's a full URI and not just scheme+host+port.
That's why I suggested we should change nsIPrincipal to make this kind of thing easier. Make GetOrigin() reflect the real origin from the URI and a new GetOriginDomain() or whatever for browserish places that care about whether document.domain has been set.
Of course we could leave GetOrigin() alone and do a new GetStrictOrigin(), but I suspect more people will get it wrong in the future that way.

Sounds awful :-(
I'm not at all sure I could get it right.

This would be best (easiest) from my point of view (as the author of
the JEP).

> GetStrictOrigin()
This'd also work for me ... though it'd require me to do a new release
of the JEP.

I don't know how we can avoid that -- either way is an incompatible change to the interface.
In fact for the 1.8 branch we're constrained not to break those interfaces. We will have to create a nsIPrincipal\_MOZILLA\_1\_8\_BRANCH interface to hold the new entry points and you \_will\_ have to release a new JEP :-(

OK (on the assumption that something in the new interface will
implement your ideas for a GetStrictOrigin()).
Now the question is, when should I do the release :-)
Of course, it'd \_really\_ be a lot more convenient if I could postpone
this until (say) January of next year.

Turns out it \_doesn't\_ work on the trunk (testing with today's
Minefield nightly).
The demo URL still "works" fine with Firefox 2.0.0.12, though.
Boris, do you have any idea why it wouldn't work on the trunk?
And Gregory (if you're still listening to us after all this time), do
you have any idea why your demo URL would fail to work properly with
Minefield? (One thing I did notice is that your test's log (which
appears in the browser page) says "Firefox \_NOT\_ detected ..." when
run on Minefield, but says "Firefox detected ..." when run on Firefox
2.0.0.12. The rest of the log looks entirely plausible ... but this
makes me wonder.)
Finally (just to make sure we're all on the same page), you do need to
run a web browser locally, on port 80, before running this test.

No, I don't know why it would fail. It logs "Firefox \_NOT\_ detected" based on a simplistic user-agent check.

Yes, local web server on port 80.
The demo does fail on the latest Minefield nightly, but for me, nothing from LiveConnect is working. Applets seem to load, the top-level Java packages are visible from JavaScript/LiveConnect, but object creation simply hangs.
Here are the log messages I got:
================

I re-ran the demo with a much older version of Minefield and it worked:

Maybe there is something else wrong.

Ah, now I see it!
The nsIScriptSecurityManager interface has changed yet again, without
anyone telling me. (This happened on 2008-01-04.)
This means that JavaScript-to-Java LiveConnect has been broken on the
trunk (on the Mac) since that date.
If you look in the Console log, you'll see the following message
repeated many times:
MRJ Plugin JEP: JavaScript-to-Java LiveConnect failed -- no security manager!
One more thing for me to fix in the new JEP :-(

The JEP code can use the URI exposed by our principal objects rather than the string origin and that way fix this issue, right?
If so, that's probably the way to go for now, as it sounds like we need an updated JEP for trunk anyways.Flags: blocking1.9? → blocking1.9+

That doesn't sound right to me ... but then I don't know a whole lot
about nsIPrincipal.

Dveditz still hasn't answered my question from [comment #32](/show_bug.cgi?id=408329#c32 "VERIFIED FIXED - Mac OS X Java Plugin (JEP) - LiveConnect can still use document.domain bypass to create arbitrary socket connections") ...
But now I've updated the JEP to be aware of the most recent changes to
the nsIScriptSecurityManager interface, and am about to test if the
patch for [bug 413161](/show_bug.cgi?id=413161 "VERIFIED FIXED - nsIPrincipal needs a stricter origin") has fixed this problem on the trunk.
However, now I find that I can no longer access this bug's testcase
(at <http://b64.localhost.pseudo-flaw.net/mrj-plugin-test.html>). I get
the error "You don't have permission to access /mrj-plugin-test.html
on this server."
Gregory, I assume this is caused by a problem on the server. Could
you fix it?
Thanks in advance!

(Following up [comment #32](/show_bug.cgi?id=408329#c32 "VERIFIED FIXED - Mac OS X Java Plugin (JEP) - LiveConnect can still use document.domain bypass to create arbitrary socket connections"))
Looking through the patch for [bug 413161](/show_bug.cgi?id=413161 "VERIFIED FIXED - nsIPrincipal needs a stricter origin"), I've formed the following
hypothesis. Someone please tell me whether or not it's correct:
Among other things, the patch for [bug 413161](/show_bug.cgi?id=413161 "VERIFIED FIXED - nsIPrincipal needs a stricter origin") changes the definition of
nsIPrincipal's "origin" attribute (on the trunk) from
"the origin of this principal's domain, if non-null, or its codebase
URI otherwise"
to
"the origin of this principal's codebase URI"
This is enough, by itself, to fix this bug ([bug 408329](/show_bug.cgi?id=408329 "VERIFIED FIXED - Mac OS X Java Plugin (JEP) - LiveConnect can still use document.domain bypass to create arbitrary socket connections")).
A change like this wouldn't be allowed on the 1.8 branch.
But nsIPrincipal's "URI" attribute is defined (on both the trunk and
the 1.8 branch) as "the codebase URI to which this principal
pertains". (I assume "codebase" here means the same thing as it does
above.)
So it would also be possible to fix this bug, on both the trunk and
the 1.8 branch, by changing the JEP to use nsIPrincipal objects' "URI"
attributes (suitably translated into a string) instead of their
"origin" attributes.
Is this correct?

Thanks, Gregory. Your testcase is accessible again.
And my results with it indicate that the patch for [bug 413161](/show_bug.cgi?id=413161 "VERIFIED FIXED - nsIPrincipal needs a stricter origin") \_has\_
fixed this bug on the trunk.
On the trunk, the contents of "Java Console.log" indicate the "origin"
is now set to "b64.localhost.pseudo-flaw.net" (instead of
"localhost.pseudo-flaw.net" as on the branch). And when (on the
trunk) the test applet tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:80, it now
triggers the following error:
java.security.AccessControlException:
access denied (java.net.SocketPermission 127.0.0.1:80 connect,resolve)

Taking this off the blocker list since this should be fixed on trunk now, with the fix in [bug 413161](/show_bug.cgi?id=413161 "VERIFIED FIXED - nsIPrincipal needs a stricter origin"). Please renominate if that is not the case.Flags: blocking1.9+ → blocking1.9-

I thought this was going to be easy to fix on both the trunk and the
1.8 branch (along the lines of what I said in [comment #34](/show_bug.cgi?id=408329#c34 "VERIFIED FIXED - Mac OS X Java Plugin (JEP) - LiveConnect can still use document.domain bypass to create arbitrary socket connections")), but that
turns out not to be the case.
The basic problem is that the JEP currently doesn't link in \_anything\_
from the Mozilla.org tree (all its interactions are done via pure
XPCOM), and I want to keep it that way. But if I have to deal with an
nsIURI object (nsIPrincipal's "URI" attribute) instead of an ASCIIZ
string (nsIPrincipal's "origin" attribute), I'll either have to link
in Mozilla.org's string class implementation or roll my own copy of
it. I don't want to do either of these.
So I need a simple change on the 1.8 branch -- either 1) change
nsIPrincipal's "origin" on the branch the same way it's already been
changed on the trunk, or 2) create a private interface to nsIPrincipal
that (in effect) allows me to access nsIPrincipal's "URI" attribute as
an ASCIIZ string.
