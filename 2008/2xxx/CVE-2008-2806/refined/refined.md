        "details": "Root cause: The vulnerability lies in how Mozilla indicates the origin of a document to the Java Embedding Plugin (JEP) on Mac OS X.\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities: The Mozilla browser incorrectly conveys document origin to the Java plugin, which can be exploited due to how the LiveConnect functionality is implemented. The Java plugin trusts the origin information provided by the browser.\nImpact of exploitation: A malicious Java applet can bypass the same-origin policy and create arbitrary socket connections to other domains, potentially allowing data theft or further attacks.\nAttack vectors: By tricking the victim into visiting a malicious web page containing a malicious Java applet.\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to host a malicious web page with a malicious java applet. They also require the victim to visit the malicious page. This could be done via phishing, malvertising or other techniques."

        "details": "Root cause: The vulnerability stems from the way the Mac OS X Java Plugin (JEP) LiveConnect uses the document.domain bypass to create arbitrary socket connections. Specifically, the JEP relies on the browser to provide the origin of the document using `nsIScriptSecurityManager::GetSubjectPrincipal()` which could be manipulated.\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities: The JEP's LiveConnect implementation does not enforce strict same-origin policies. It uses `nsIPrincipal::GetOrigin()` which is affected by document.domain. This allows a malicious Java applet to bypass the same-origin policy.\nImpact of exploitation: An attacker can create arbitrary socket connections to other domains, potentially leading to data exfiltration or further exploitation of the victim's system.\nAttack vectors: By hosting a malicious web page with a specially crafted Java applet that utilizes the LiveConnect functionality, and then tricking users into visiting that page.\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to host a website and create a malicious Java applet. They must also be able to trick victims into visiting the malicious page."
