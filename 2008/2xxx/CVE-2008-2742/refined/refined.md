{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Achievo application's FCKeditor file manager allows uploading files with specific extensions. The application does not properly check and validate multiple file extensions allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files containing malicious PHP code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Improper file extension handling",
    "Arbitrary file upload vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload arbitrary files containing malicious PHP code, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a POST request to the `connector.php` script with a crafted file upload request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server, and know the path to the vulnerable file manager."
