Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-2417:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `showQAnswer.asp` script. Specifically, the `qNo` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `qNo` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and potentially other confidential information.
- Unauthorized Access: By extracting login credentials, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application and potentially other systems.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `showQAnswer.asp` script, injecting malicious SQL code through the `qNo` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- Basic SQL knowledge: The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft the injection queries.

**Detailed explanation:**
The exploit example provided shows how to use a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve the `Login` and `Password` fields from the `member` table, which gives a clear indication on the severity of this vulnerability. The exploit also demonstrates how to enumerate users, by filtering the usernames that are already know, which can be used to build a user/password database, or to find a specific user with the desired level of access. The lack of input validation on the `qNo` parameter allows for arbitrary SQL to be executed by the database server.
