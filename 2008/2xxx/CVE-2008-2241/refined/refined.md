Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-2241:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `caloggerd` log daemon of CA BrightStor ARCserve Backup.
- The daemon improperly handles log messages containing directory traversal modifiers (e.g., "../").

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of paths provided within log messages. The daemon fails to validate if directory traversal characters are present.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** The lack of input validation allows an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths, leading to arbitrary file writing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to write arbitrary data to arbitrary files can result in arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable system.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability could easily lead to a full compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can exploit it over a network connection.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** Authentication is not required for exploiting this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Connectivity:** Attackers require network connectivity to the target system.
- **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is necessary to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Malicious Log Messages:** Attackers must send specially crafted log messages containing directory traversal modifiers to the vulnerable `caloggerd` daemon.

**Additional Details:**

- Computer Associates released an update to fix the vulnerability, which can be found at the provided link in the advisory.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific filter ID (4685).
