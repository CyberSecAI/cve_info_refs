*    of Microsoft Office 2003. It could be exploited by remote attacker
*    to take complete control of an affected system. This issue is due to
*    stack overflow error in function that read secions from WPS file.
*    When we change size of for example TEXT section to number langer than
*    0x10, stack overflow occurs - very easy to exploit.
*
*
* Tested on:
*	  Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 && Microsoft Office 2003

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-011 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Works File Converter Could Allow Remote Code Execution (947081)

Published: February 12, 2008 | Updated: April 16, 2008

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This important security update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Works File Converter. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Works (.wps) file with an affected version of Microsoft Office, Microsoft Works, or Microsoft Works Suite. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This is an important security update for all supported editions of Microsoft Works Converter. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses these vulnerabilities by replacing the vulnerable version of the Works Converter on a system. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.**  Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 947081](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/947081) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software has been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2. Are any additional security features included in this update?**

Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2003, when users of Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. All updates released after January 1, 2008 for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 will include these security features, which were introduced in [Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=e25b7049-3e13-433b-b9d2-5e3c1132f206&displaylang;=en). We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951646](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/951646).

**What is the Microsoft Works File Converter used for?**

The Microsoft Works File Converter is a set of converters that allows Microsoft Office applications to open, edit, and save files in the Works file format supported by Works versions 6, 7, 8, and 9.

**What does this update do to address the vulnerabilities discussed in this bulletin?**

This update replaces the vulnerable version of the Works File Converter on an affected system with a non-affected version of the converter. However, after this update is installed and the first time a user attempts to open a .wps file, they will be prompted to download the [Microsoft Works 6 - 9 Converter from the Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=bf41401e-70fa-465d-ae2e-cf44dbf05297&displaylang;=en). Once the Microsoft Works 6 - 9 Converter is installed on a system, the user will not be prompted to install the Microsoft Works 6 - 9 Converter again.

**Why doesnât this update install the Microsoft Works 6-9 File Converter with this bulletin?**

The Microsoft Works 6-9 File Converter binaries were not offered through the standard security bulletin process to allow customers the choice of installing the updated version of the converter if they required its functionality.

**Will my system be protected if I only install this update and not the Microsoft Works 6-9 File Converter?**

Yes, once this update is applied to an affected system, it will be protected from the vulnerabilities discussed in this bulletin regardless of whether the Microsoft Works 6-9 File Converter is installed.

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 947081](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/947081) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains updates for several vulnerabilities because the root cause of the issues are similarly related. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these software versions or editions, visit [Microsoft Product Support Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).

Customers who require custom support for older releases must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Works File Converter Input Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0216

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content, or compromised Web sites and advertisement servers could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.

This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.

To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:

* [Windows Installer 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en) Redistributable
* [Windows Installer 2.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33338) Redistributable for Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0
* [Windows Installer 2.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33337) Redistributable for Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, and Windows Millennium Edition

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/q** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/q:u** | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user. |
| **/q:a** | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user. |
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files. |
| **/c** | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |
| **/r:n** | Never restarts the system after installation. |
| **/r:I** | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**. |
| **/r:a** | Always restarts the system after installation. |
| **/r:s** | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user. |
| **/n:v** | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Removing the Update**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. **Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office 2003 CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the âMicrosoft baseline Security Analyzerâ heading under the section, Microsoft Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
