Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `wp-people` WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The plugin's `wp-people-popup.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the `person` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Partial Confidentiality Impact:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials (`user_pass`, `user_login`).
*   **Partial Integrity Impact:** The attacker could potentially modify data within the database, although the specific details of what can be modified aren't listed here.
*   **Partial Availability Impact:**  A successful SQL injection might allow the attacker to disrupt the functionality of the website or database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By obtaining user credentials, an attacker could potentially gain administrative access to the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **HTTP Request:** The exploit is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `wp-people-popup.php` file with a malicious `person` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require prior authentication.
*   **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious URL.

**Exploit Code:**

*   The provided exploit URL demonstrates how to perform the attack:
    ```
    wp-content/plugins/wp-people/wp-people-popup.php?person=-1%2F%2A%2A%2Funion%2F%2A%2A%2Fselect%2F%2A%2A%2F0%2Cuser_pass%2Cuser_login%2C3%2F%2A%2A%2Ffrom%2F%2A%2A%2Fwp_users
    ```
    This URL attempts to retrieve the `user_pass` and `user_login` fields from the `wp_users` table.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided CVSS score is 7.5/10, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
*   The exploit is considered easily exploitable, as indicated by a 10/10 exploitability subscore.
*   The identified CWE is CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
*   A Google dork is provided: `inurl: "wp-people"`
