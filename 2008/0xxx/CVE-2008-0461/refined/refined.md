  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exposure (e.g., retrieving user credentials by accessing the 'nuke_authors' table, as demonstrated in the exploit), data modification, or complete compromise of the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted POST request to the 'modules.php?name=Search' page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable PHP-Nuke application. No authentication is needed."
