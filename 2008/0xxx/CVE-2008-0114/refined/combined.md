## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Excel Could Allow Remote Code Execution (949029)

Published: March 11, 2008 | Updated: October 01, 2008

**Version:** 3.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves several privately reported and publicly reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Excel that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Excel file. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft Office Excel 2000 Service Pack 3 and rated Important for Excel 2002 Service Pack 3, Excel 2003 Service Pack 2, Excel Viewer 2003, Excel 2007, Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats, Office 2004 for Mac, and Office 2008 for Mac. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

This security update addresses these vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Excel performs validations when opening Excel files.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**What components of the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats are updated by this bulletin?**
The update included with this security bulletin applies only to the specific component within the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats that is affected. For example, in an Excel bulletin, only the Excel compatibility pack component files are included in the update packages and not Word or PowerPoint compatibility pack component files. Word compatibility pack component files are updated in a Word bulletin and PowerPoint compatibility pack component files are updated in a PowerPoint bulletin.

**I do not have any products in the Affected Software table installed on my system, but the affected software was included in the Microsoft Office suite from which I installed other Office components. Why am I being offered the security update?**
The vulnerabilities described in this security update exist within Microsoft Office but could not be exploited using applications not listed in the Affected Software table. However, some non-affected Microsoft Office applications use some of the same files as the applications listed in the Affected Software table that the security update does affect. In some cases, detection of these shared files will cause the update to be offered even if none of the applications listed in the Affected Software table are present. These shared files do not constitute a vulnerability, but we do recommend installing the security update to prevent it from being offered again.

**I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2. Are any additional security features included in this update?**
Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2003, when users of Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. All updates released after January 1, 2008 for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 will include these security features, which were introduced in [Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=e25b7049-3e13-433b-b9d2-5e3c1132f206&displaylang;=en). We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951646](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/951646).

**Why did Microsoft re-release this bulletin on March 19, 2008?**
This bulletin has been re-released to re-offer the security update to users of Microsoft Office Excel 2003 Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 3. The security update previously had a known issue in Microsoft Office Excel 2003 Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 3. The problem caused Excel calculations to return an incorrect result when a Real Time Data source is used in a user-defined Visual Basic for Applications function. For more information on this issue, including how to determine which version of the update you have installed, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 950340](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/950340). Automatic Updates will correctly offer this update to users of Microsoft Office Excel 2003 Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 3, whether or not they have applied the original MS08-014.

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update?**
Microsoft is aware of a problem with the initial release of this update that may affect users of Microsoft Excel 2003 Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 3. The problem causes Excel calculations to return an incorrect result when a Real Time Data source is used in a user-defined Visual Basic for Applications function. If you have applications that leverage Real Time Data sources in Visual Basic for Applications functions, we recommend that you perform additional testing before initiating a wide deployment of the update. The investigation on this has been completed and we have issued a re-release of the bulletin on 3/19/2008 to address the problem in the affected versions of Microsoft Excel. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 950340](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/950340).

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**
The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

**I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. Why am I still being offered this update?**

Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 is not impacted by the security vulnerabilities documented in this bulletin. However, users will still be offered this update because the update files for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 are newer (with higher version numbers) than the files that are currently on your system. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to their environment and configurations of their systems.

**I use 2007 Microsoft Office System Service Pack 1. Why am I still being offered this update?**

2007 Microsoft Office System Service Pack 1 is not impacted by the security vulnerabilities documented in this bulletin. However, users will still be offered this update because the update files for 2007 Microsoft Office Service Pack 1 are newer (with higher version numbers) than the files that currently on your system. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to their environment and configurations of their systems.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute a flaw in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**What is included in the Microsoft Office update that causes the higher version of the update files?**

The update files include changes to support stability changes in Microsoft Office and additional changes to support corporate environment changes. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to their environment and configurations of their systems.

## Excel Data Validation Record Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0111

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Excel processes data validation records when loading Excel files into memory. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a malformed file which could be hosted on a specially crafted or compromised Web site, or included as an e-mail attachment.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-0111](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0111).

#### Mitigating Factors for Excel Data Validation Record Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0111

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and later editions of Office.

#### Workarounds for Excel Data Validation Record Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0111

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

  **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

  **For Office 2003**

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001

  **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2003, all of the latest Office 2003 security updates must be applied.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special âexempt directoryâ as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848) will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.

  **How to Undo the Workaround:**

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000
* Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

  The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) will protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

  To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office installed.

  To install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  [Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&displaylang=en)

  MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:

  <https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us>

  To enable MOICE, change the registered handle for the .xls, .xlt, and .xla file formats. The following table describes the command to enable or to disable MOICE for the .xls, .xlt, and .xla file formats:

| Command to use to enable MOICE to be the registered handler | Command to use to disable MOICE as the registered handler |
| --- | --- |
| ASSOC .XLS=oice.excel.sheet | ASSOC .xls=Excel.Sheet.8 |
| ASSOC .XLT=oice.excel.template | ASSOC .xlt=Excel.Template |
| ASSOC .XLA=oice.excel.addin | ASSOC .xla=Excel.Addin |

For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

**Impact of Workaround:** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

  **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Excel is used are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Excel validates macro information.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.

This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.

To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:

* [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en)
* [Windows Installer 2.0 Redistributable for Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33338)
* [Windows Installer 2.0 Redistributable for Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, and Windows Millennium Edition](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33337)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Removing the Update**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office 2003 in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the âMicrosoft baseline Security Analyzerâ heading under the section, Microsoft Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
