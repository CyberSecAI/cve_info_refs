- Root cause of vulnerability: The Math Comment Spam Protection WordPress plugin versions 2.1 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The plugin's options page contains two persistent XSS vulnerabilities in the `mcsp_opt_msg_no_answer` and `mcsp_opt_msg_wrong_answer` parameters.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings. When an administrator or any visitor triggers the display of the error messages (by submitting a comment with an empty or incorrect captcha), the injected script will execute, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- Attack vectors: The attack requires a combination of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and XSS. An attacker would first use CSRF to inject malicious code into the `mcsp_opt_msg_no_answer` or `mcsp_opt_msg_wrong_answer` parameters on the plugin's options page (which needs to be done by an administrator), then trick an administrator or a visitor to post a comment with incorrect captcha parameters, triggering the execution of the XSS payload.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to trick an administrator to perform a CSRF attack. Also, they must be able to induce either the administrator or a visitor to trigger the XSS vulnerability by interacting with the comment section and submitting comments with incorrect captcha values.
