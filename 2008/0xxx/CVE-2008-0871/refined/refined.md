Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-0871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Web Authorization Buffer Overflow:** The web interface of NowSMS, which listens on port 8800, has a vulnerability in the function that handles the base64 encoded password located in the HTTP Authorization header. Lack of proper bounds checking allows for a stack-based buffer overflow when the provided password exceeds 256 bytes after base64 decoding.
*  **SMPP Buffer Overflow**: The NowSMS application uses a 4KB stack buffer to store incoming SMPP packets. The vulnerability occurs because of the lack of size validation on the incoming SMPP packets, leading to a buffer overflow if a packet larger than 4KB is sent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability in both cases is a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by insufficient bounds checking of user-supplied input.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The web interface does not validate the length of the base64 encoded password string. Similarly, the SMPP implementation doesn't validate the size of incoming packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of either the web authorization buffer overflow or the SMPP buffer overflow can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the NowSMS process. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, and further malicious activities.
*   **Denial of Service:** Overflows can cause the application to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The web authorization buffer overflow is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP request with an overly long base64 encoded string in the "Authorization" header to the web interface listening on port 8800. This can be done regardless of whether the server requires authentication or not.
*   **SMPP Packet:** The SMPP buffer overflow can be triggered by sending an overly large SMPP packet to the SMPP server, on its listening port (which needs to be configured by the admin). This server is not enabled by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the NowSMS server.
*   **HTTP Client:** For the web vulnerability, the attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests.
*   **SMPP Client (for SMPP vulnerability):** The attacker needs the ability to send SMPP packets to the target.
*  **Knowledge of the Exploit:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided exploit code targets the web authorization buffer overflow, and includes options for both bind and reverse shell payloads.
*   The vulnerable versions are Now SMS/MMS Gateway <= v2007.06.27.
*   The SMPP server is not enabled by default, and the listening port needs to be configured by the admin.
* The provided exploit code uses an egghunter, and for reverse shell, it leverages an alphanumeric shellcode, which may avoid some basic intrusion detection measures
