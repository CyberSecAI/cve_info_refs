Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-0809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize URLs within the `htmlscrubber` component of Ikiwiki. Specifically, the `htmlscrubber` did not block javascript in URIs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS. By injecting malicious JavaScript code through URIs, attackers can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user's browser when they view a page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Malicious Actions:** This could lead to a range of malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the wiki.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.
    - Injecting content into the page.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious URIs:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript by including specially crafted URIs, which are not sanitized by Ikiwiki's htmlscrubber.
- **Web-based editing:** A user could insert these malicious URIs by editing page content using the web-based interface.
- **Meta plugin:**  The meta plugin could also be theoretically used to inject javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Edit Content:** Attackers need the ability to add or modify content that is processed by Ikiwiki, either directly or via the web interface.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** Attackers need an understanding of the vulnerability to craft the malicious URLs.

**Additional Details:**

-   **Fix:** The vulnerability was addressed by adding a whitelist of valid URI types, excluding JavaScript.
-   **Affected Versions:** Ikiwiki versions before 1.1.46 are vulnerable.
-   **Patches:** Patches were released for both stable and unstable distributions of Debian, fixing this issue (versions 1.33.4 and 2.31.1 respectively).
-   **Related CVE:** This CVE is closely related to CVE-2008-0808 which also involves javascript insertion via the meta plugin.
