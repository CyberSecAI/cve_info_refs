**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from `securityreason.com` lists multiple CVEs including CVE-2008-0200. It also provides a summary of vulnerabilities discovered by MustLive. This indicates that the provided content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

The relevant vulnerability, based on the provided text, is within **RotaBanner Local <= 3**. Specifically, it is a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `user` and `drop` parameters within the `index.html` file of RotaBanner.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not neutralize or encode user-supplied input before including it in the HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the context of a user's session.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser.
    *   This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or other malicious actions performed within the user's session.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `user` or `drop` parameter.
    *   The victim visits the crafted URL, which executes the malicious script in their browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to visit the malicious URL.

**Technical Details:**

The following URLs are vulnerable:

*   `http://site/account/index.html?user=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E`
*   `http://site/account/index.html?drop=%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E`

These URLs demonstrate the injection of JavaScript code via the `user` and `drop` parameters.
The vulnerability exists in RotaBanner Local 3 and earlier versions, and the developer did not patch the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were reported by MustLive on 14.05.2007 and disclosed on 10.12.2007 after the developers of RotaBanner did not patch the issues and did not consider them a security issue.
