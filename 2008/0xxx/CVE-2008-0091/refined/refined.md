Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `download2.php` script of AGENCY4NET WEBFTP. The script takes a `file` parameter, which is then directly used in a `readfile()` and `unlink()` function without any proper sanitization or validation. The vulnerability is further exposed due to the use of `register_globals`, which allows external control over the `$file` variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) in the `file` parameter.
- **Remote File Inclusion (Local File Inclusion):** By manipulating the `file` parameter, an attacker can force the server to read and delete arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `$file` variable is directly taken from user input and used in file system operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) on the server's filesystem through the `readfile()` function.
- **File Deletion:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server's filesystem through the `unlink()` function, if the web server has sufficient permissions to do so.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the `download2.php` script, including the vulnerable `file` parameter with a directory traversal sequence and the path of the target file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know the path to the `download2.php` script.
- **Understanding of Directory Traversal:** The attacker needs to be familiar with directory traversal techniques.
- **`register_globals` Enabled:** The server must have the PHP `register_globals` setting enabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was initially disclosed on Milw0rm with an exploit provided and was later assigned the CVE number.
- The researcher also noted that file deletion capabilities were not mentioned in the original disclosure on Milw0rm.
- The vulnerability is present in AGENCY4NET WEBFTP version 1.
