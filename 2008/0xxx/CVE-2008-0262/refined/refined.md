ID: CVE-2008-0262
```
The provided content relates to CVE-2008-0262. It describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Agares phpAutoVideo v2.21.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly sanitize user input passed through the `articlecat` parameter in the `articleblock.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials.
- The second exploit shows how an attacker can retrieve the administrator username and password, potentially leading to full control of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the `articlecat` parameter in `includes/articleblock.php`.
- The second exploit shows how to exploit this via `index.php?loadpage=./includes/articleblock.php&articlecat=[SQL]`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No special privileges or authentication is required.
