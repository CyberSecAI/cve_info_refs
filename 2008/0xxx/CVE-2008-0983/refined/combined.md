How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### sigsegv @ fdevent\_get\_handler - when congestion occurs, and file descriptor arrays is full.

**Description**

I'm experiencing segfaults when congestion occurs, at 800-850Mbps.

The crashes occurs here:
lighttpdr1334: segfault at 0000000c eip 0805ef46 esp bfc63e80 error 4

```

#!asm
0x0805ef44 <fdevent_get_handler+20>:    je     0x805ef4f <fdevent_get_handler+31>
0x0805ef46 <fdevent_get_handler+22>:    cmp    0x8(%eax),%edx
0x0805ef49 <fdevent_get_handler+25>:    jne    0x805ef7c <fdevent_get_handler+76>

```
```

#!c
171         if (ev->fdarray[fd]->fd != fd) SEGFAULT();

```

I guess eax is ev->fdarray[fd](/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Fd), it's not NULL but it's not a valid pointer either, thus, trying to access ev->fdarray[fd](/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Fd)->fd makes lighty read from inexistent segments or segments without read permission.

So what's wrong ? Maybe fd is just an index out of the allocated array. Let's have a look on how it's being created.

fdevent.c:

```

#!c
 15 fdevents *fdevent_init(size_t maxfds, fdevent_handler_t type) {
 19         ev->fdarray = calloc(maxfds, sizeof(*ev->fdarray));

```

server.c:

```

#!c
1076         if (NULL == (srv->ev = fdevent_init(srv->max_fds + 1, srv->event_handler))) {

```

and earlier in the same file:

```

#!c
 679                 if (0 != getrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, &rlim)) {
 680                         log_error_write(srv, __FILE__, __LINE__,
 681                                         "ss", "couldn't get 'max filedescriptors'",
 682                                         strerror(errno));
 683                         return -1;
 684                 }
 685
 686                 if (use_rlimit && srv->srvconf.max_fds) {
 687                         /* set rlimits */
 688
 689                         rlim.rlim_cur = srv->srvconf.max_fds;
 690                         rlim.rlim_max = srv->srvconf.max_fds;
 691
 692                         if (0 != setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, &rlim)) {
 693                                 log_error_write(srv, __FILE__, __LINE__,
 694                                                 "ss", "couldn't set 'max filedescriptors'",
 695                                                 strerror(errno));
 696                                 return -1;
 697                         }
 698                 }

 700                 /* #372: solaris need some fds extra for devpoll */
 701                 if (rlim.rlim_cur > 10) rlim.rlim_cur -= 10;

 827                         srv->max_fds = rlim.rlim_cur;

```

So, here's what's being done:
 - the process fetch the current configured rlimits and save it in rlim
 - if the configuration has a setting for max\_fds, it override the one that's configured for the current task
 - The, the max\_fds get decremented by 10 (solaris bugfix, yay)
 - and the allocation of the file descriptor array is being made using max\_fds as size.

And here's what happen:
 - The system can give you more than max\_fds file descriptors
 - fd > max\_fds
 - sigsegv

Possible workarounds:
 - comment line 701 in server.c if you're not running solaris
 or
 - replace maxfds by maxfds + 10 in line 19 of fdevent.c
 or
 - fix this race condition ;-)

If i understood the [#372](/issues/372 "Bug: dev-poll interface problem on Solaris 10 (Fixed)") problem correctly, Solaris doesn't want to poll for rlim.cur fds, as one is used for the /dev/poll fd, and returns an error.

But it doesn't seem to matter if the dopoll.dp\_nfds value is a little bit smaller - it is just the max number of events to be polled in one syscall.

So i think reducing the number dopoll.dp\_nfds by one in fdevent\_solaris\_devpoll\_poll should fix [#372](/issues/372 "Bug: dev-poll interface problem on Solaris 10 (Fixed)") and we can remove the previous "fix" for it to fix this bug ([#1562](/issues/1562 "Bug: sigsegv @ fdevent_get_handler - when congestion occurs, and file descriptor arrays is full. (Fixed)")).

Does this apply to 1.4.13 as well?

Yes; [#372](/issues/372 "Bug: dev-poll interface problem on Solaris 10 (Fixed)") was "fixed" (i.e. introduced this bug) in r853, which was between 1.4.7 and 1.4.8.

Doesn't this allow for an easy DoS attack?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# lighttpd: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-10**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/lighttpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.18-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.18-r2** |

### Background

lighttpd is a lightweight high-performance web server.

### Description

lighttpd contains a calculation error when allocating the global file
descriptor array (CVE-2008-0983). Furthermore, it sends the source of a
CGI script instead of returning a 500 error (Internal Server Error)
when the fork() system call fails (CVE-2008-1111).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a Denial
of Service or gain the source of a CGI script.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All lighttpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/lighttpd-1.4.18-r2"
```

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- wireshark security problems
Multiple flaws in wireshark could lead to crashes when certain
packets are processed (CVE-2008-1561,CVE-2008-1562,CVE-2008-1563)
These problems only affected wireshark in openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3
and were fixed there.
- otrs SOAP command execution
A bug in the trouble ticket system OTRS allowed a remote attacker
to get remote access without specifying a valid user name via the
SOAP interface (CVE-2008-1515).
otrs is only included on openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and was fixed there.
- xine security problems
Specially crafted files could cause integer overflows in the xine
library.
Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user who opened such a file
(CVE-2008-1482).
xine was updated on all SUSE Linux products containing xine.
- xgl various X related security fixes
Xgl uses the XFree86/X.Org code base and so was also affected by
various integer overflow bugs found and fixed in those.
(CVE-2007-6429, CVE-2007-1003, CVE-2007-5958, CVE-2007-6427,
CVE-2007-6428, CVE-2007-6429, CVE-2008-0006)
Xgl was updated on SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10, SUSE Linux 10.1,
openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- silc-toolkit buffer overflow
A flaw in processing PKCS#1-Messages in silc-toolkit could lead
to a buffer overflow. Remote attackers could exploit that to crash
the server. (CVE-2008-1552)
Only openSUSE 10.3 contains silc-toolkit and was fixed.
- lighttpd security problems
Several security problems were fixed in lighttpd.
- Remote attackers were able to crash lighttpd by opening
a large number of connections (CVE-2008-0983).
- A bug in mod\_cgi allowed remote attackers to read
cgi source files (CVE-2008-1111).
- A bug in mod\_userdir allowed remote attackers to read
arbitrary files (CVE-2008-1270).
lighttpd is only included in SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 (SDK),
SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and was fixed for those
distributions.
- tk GIF problems
Specially crafted GIF images could cause a buffer overflow and
crash the toolkit library tk. It seems unlikely but not entirely
impossible that this overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2008-0553).
Tk was updated on all products.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Package        : lighttpd
Vulnerability  : various
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0983 CVE-2007-3948
Debian Bug     : 434888 466663

Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd,
a fast webserver with minimal memory footprint.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2008-0983
  lighttpd 1.4.18, and possibly other versions before 1.5.0, does not
  properly calculate the size of a file descriptor array, which allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large number
  of connections, which triggers an out-of-bounds access.

CVE-2007-3948
  connections.c in lighttpd before 1.4.16 might accept more connections
  than the configured maximum, which allows remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service (failed assertion) via a large number of connection
  attempts.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.13-4etch9.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.18-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
