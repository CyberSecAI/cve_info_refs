Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the `arias/help/effect.php` file of the Aria ERP system. The vulnerability occurs because the script directly includes a file specified by the `page` parameter in the URL without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary local files on the server by manipulating the `page` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate the `page` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify any file path.
- **`is_file()` Check Bypass:** The `is_file()` function checks if the provided page parameter is a file but it does not prevent directory traversal. For example, using `../../../../etc/passwd` will not trigger `file_not_found.php` because `../../../../etc/passwd` is not a regular file inside the current directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to read any file accessible to the web server user, including sensitive configuration files, source code, and potentially password files.
- **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Although not directly mentioned, if an attacker can upload malicious code to the server or find a log file containing user input, they can then include this file, leading to remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP GET request with a `page` parameter that specifies the file to include.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `page` parameter in the URL to point to the desired file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
- **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the server's filesystem to target specific files.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
