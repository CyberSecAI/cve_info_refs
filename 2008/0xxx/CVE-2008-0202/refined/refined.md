Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0202 (Based on the context, it is related to the identified vulnerability in ExpressionEngine, but no official CVE description was provided)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a combination of HTTP Response Splitting and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues within ExpressionEngine. Specifically, an `index.php` parameter is implicated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate input when generating HTTP responses, allowing an attacker to inject malicious characters (like CRLF - carriage return line feed) to manipulate HTTP headers.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Input is not sanitized, which enables attackers to inject malicious scripts that are executed within a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** Attackers could potentially redirect users to malicious websites, perform cache poisoning, or conduct other attacks by manipulating the HTTP response headers.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers could steal cookies, impersonate users, inject malicious content, or conduct other attacks by executing scripts in the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted HTTP requests that target the vulnerable `index.php` parameter. Attackers manipulate the request to include malicious code to split HTTP responses or inject scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable ExpressionEngine server.
- No specific access to the target system is mentioned beyond the ability to send HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects ExpressionEngine versions 1.2.1 and 1.3.1.
- The vulnerability was reported by Securityvulns on November 22, 2007.
