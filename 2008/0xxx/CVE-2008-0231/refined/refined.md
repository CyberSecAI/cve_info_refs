```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly includes a file specified by the user via the 'page' GET parameter without proper sanitization or validation. It checks if the file exists before including it but fails to prevent directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "Lack of input sanitization",
    "Directory traversal vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files on the server, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure, code execution if an attacker can upload a php file, or other attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP request with a 'page' GET parameter containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., '../../../../../../') followed by the path to the desired file.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special user privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability."
