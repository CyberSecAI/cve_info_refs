As a result, a buffer overrun could occur allowing an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code. An attacker with valid Windows logon credentials and user permissions to SQL could exploit this vulnerability to gain complete control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
