How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-040 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft SQL Server Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (941203)

Published: July 08, 2008 | Updated: March 18, 2009

**Version:** 1.9

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves four privately disclosed vulnerabilities. The more serious of the vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to run code and to take complete control of an affected system. An authenticated attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

This security update is rated Important for supported releases of SQL Server 7.0, SQL Server 2000, SQL Server 2005, Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE) 1.0, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000), Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine (WMSDE), and Windows Internal Database (WYukon). For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that SQL Server manages page reuse, allocating more memory for the convert function, validating on-disk files before loading them, and validating insert statements. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 941203](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/941203) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. For more information about installing these updates, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update** subsection, in this section.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

Depending on your software version or edition, you may need to choose between GDR and QFE software update links below in order to manually install your update from the Microsoft Download Center. For more information on determining which update to install on your system, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update** subsection, in this section.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-0106](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0106).

#### Mitigating Factors for SQL Server Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0106

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker must have valid Windows logon credentials with user permissions to SQL in order to exploit this vulnerability.
* By default, SQL Server 2005 does not run with system privileges.
* By default, SQL Server 2005 prompts the administrator to choose a domain user account during the install. If the installer configured SQL Server 2005 to run as a non-privileged domain account, this domain account could be less impacted by attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for SQL Server Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0106

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for SQL Server Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0106

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

An elevation of privilege vulnerability results from the way that SQL Server manages memory in processing the insert statement. This vulnerability could allow an authenticated attacker to run code and take complete control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

SQL Server insufficiently checks insert statements before processing them. As a result, a buffer overrun could result and allow an authenticated attacker to execute code of the attackerâs choice.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain elevation of privilege on an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An authenticated attacker could create insert statements that cause a buffer overrun, thus corrupting memory in such a way as to allow code execution.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where SQL Server 2005 is used are primarily at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by validating insert statements.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. This security bulletin addresses the privately disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

Example of how to remove QFE from all instances:

%windir%\SQL9\_KB948108\_ENU\hotfix.exe /quiet /uninstall /allinstances

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
