Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-0948:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Buffer Overflow/Array Overrun:** The vulnerability stems from an array overrun within the RPC library used by the Kerberos administration server (kadmind). Specifically, the code that tracks the highest-numbered file descriptor doesn't properly validate against `FD_SETSIZE` (or a similar macro) before using the file descriptor in an array index operation. This occurs in the `libgssrpc` library.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Input Validation:**  The core issue is the lack of proper input validation when handling file descriptor numbers within the RPC library. This library does not check to ensure that a file descriptor number is less than a maximum size defined by FD\_SETSIZE, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrarily high file descriptor numbers which can cause out-of-bounds writes during the array index operations.
*   **Incorrect FD_SETSIZE Check:** In versions prior to 1.3, the `_gssrpc_rpc_dtablesize()` function may fail to account for systems where `unistd.h` does not define `FD_SETSIZE`, leading to use of a smaller size than actually available or needed.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is the potential to crash the `kadmind` process due to memory corruption. An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause this DoS.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although there are no known exploits for this, memory corruption could theoretically be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Potential Database Corruption:** The memory corruption could result in data being overwritten in the Kerberos database, leading to inconsistency or incorrect operation.
*   **Information Leak:** In the case of CVE-2008-0063, operations on uninitialized buffer content, if triggered, can lead to information disclosure.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker sending specially crafted messages/requests to the `kadmind` process on the affected server.
*   **High File Descriptor Usage:** The attack exploits the RPC library's failure to properly handle a large number of open file descriptors.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:**  The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable `kadmind` process over the network.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need valid credentials to trigger the denial of service, as the vulnerability lies in the early handling of incoming connections.
*   **Ability to Open Connections:** An attacker must be able to open many connections or generate a high number of file descriptors to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `libgssrpc` library which is used by the Kerberos administration server (`kadmind`).
*   The vulnerability has a higher impact on system where the `unistd.h` does not define the `FD_SETSIZE` macro, such as most GNU/Linux distributions before krb5-1.3.

This vulnerability primarily allows remote denial-of-service, though some sources state the possibility of code execution if the memory corruption can be controlled by the attacker.

The provided document includes patches for various versions of krb5 that address the underlying issue. It's also worth noting the difference in severity between CVE-2008-0947, for which no pre-existing condition needed to be met in order to trigger the overflow, and CVE-2008-0948, which was limited to systems not defining certain macros in C headers before 1.3, but was still critical, since many systems did not define those macros.
